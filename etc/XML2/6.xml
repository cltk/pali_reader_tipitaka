<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Theriká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant Therí. She was born in a family of Vesáli and was so called because of her sturdy build. She married and became a devoted wife, accepting the Buddha's teaching, after hearing him preach at Vesáli. Later she heard Pajápatí Gotamí and wished to leave the world, but her husband refused his permission. One day, while cooking, she developed the thought of impermanence and became an Anágámí. When her husband realised this, he took her to Pajápatí, who ordained her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past she had entertained Konágamana Buddha and built for him an arbour with draped ceiling and sanded floor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was a nun.

The spot was consecrated by the Buddha having sat there in meditation (Mhv.i.82) and also by former Buddhas doing likewise (Mhv.xv.86). The thúpa there was the first of its kind in Ceylon and enshrined the Buddha's collar-bone. Miracles, said to have been ordained by the Buddha himself, attended its enshrinement (Mhv.xvii.30, 50). The monastery was built later than the thúpa, hence its name (Mhv.xvii.62). One of the eight saplings of the Bodhi-tree at Anurádhapura was planted in the grounds and exists to this day (Mhv.xix.61). The Cittasálá was to the east of the Thúpáráma, and on that site Sanghamittá was cremated (Mhv.xx.52). It was the monks of Thúpáráma who helped Thúlatthana to become king (Mhv.xxxiii.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lañjatissa levelled the ground between the Thúpáráma and the Mahá Thúpa (about four hundred yards away), made a stone mantling for the thúpa, and built a smaller thúpa to the east of it, near which he built the Lañjakásana-hall (Mhv.xxxiii.23f). Amandagámani added an inner verandah to the uposatha-hall in the monastery (Mhv.xxxv.3), while Vasabha placed lamps round the thúpa and built a new uposatha-house (Mhv.xxxv.80, 87, 91). Bhátika-Tissa erected another assembly-hall, while Gothábhaya made certain restorations (Mhv.xxxvi.4, 106). The Sanghapála-parivena probably formed part of the monastery (Mhv.xxxvi.114).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jetthatissa removed from the Thúpáráma the stone image placed there by Devánampiyatissa and set it up in Pácínatissapabbata (Mhv.xxxvi.128).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The renegade monk Sanghamitta once threatened to destroy the Thúpáráma but was killed in the attempt (Mhv.xxxvii.27). Mahánáma provided a gold casing for the finial of the thúpa </data>
<data>(Cv.xxxvii.207) and Dhátusena restored the thúpa (Mhv.xxxviii.70), while Aggabodhi II. effected extensive repairs, almost rebuilding the whole structure (Mhv.xlii.51ff). Dáthopatissa I. did the monastery great damage, as did Kassapa II., though he afterwards made amends (Mhv.xliv.133, 138, 148). Dáthopatissa II. gave the village of Punnali to the Thúpáráma (Mhv.xlv.28), and Mánavamma built a pásáda (Mhv.xlvii.66). Aggabodhi VII. repaired the doors and transposed the pillars of the structure round the cetiya (Cv.xlviii.65). Mahinda II. placed a casing of gold and silver plates in the cetiya (Cv.xlviii.140), while Dappula II. covered the thúpaghara with golden bricks (Cv.xlix.81); both plates and bricks were later plundered by the Pandu king (Cv.l.35). The golden plates were restored by Udaya II. (Cv.li.128), and Sena Ilanga provided a building for the monks to the west of the Thúpáráma (Cv.lii.16). Rakkha Ilanga did likewise (Cv.liii.11). Mahinda IV. covered the cetiya with strips of gold and silver, provided a golden door for the vihára and instituted a great festival (Cv.liv.42f). Vijayabáhu I., Parakkamabáhu I., and Vijayabáhu IV., successively, restored the buildings and effected necessary repairs (Cv.lx.56; lxxviii.107; lxxxviii.80). The road into Anurádhapura passed by the southern gate of the Thúpáráma, eastwards and then northwards (UdA.238; VibhA.449). From the Kadambanadí to the Thúpáráma the road lay through the gate of the Rájamátuvihára (DA.ii.572).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the Thúpáráma was the Mahejjávatthu. It is said (Sp.i.86) that, at the time of Devánampiyatissa, there was in the Thúpáráma a shrine dedicated to the three Buddhas previous to Gotama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Thúpáráma.-The name of a building in Pulatthipura. The date of erection and name of the founder are unknown, but it probably existed before the time of Parakkamabáhu I (Cv.lx.56; Cv.

One day, when going to bathe with his teacher, he ate some white seeds which an old woman had spread in the sun to dry. He did this on three different days; on the third day the woman reported him to the teacher and he was beaten. When Brahmadatta ascended the throne, be sent for the teacher, wishing to avenge this insult by killing him. The teacher did not come until the king had grown older, but when he did arrive, the sight of him so rekindled the king's hatred, that he ordered him to be put to death. But the teacher spoke to him, telling him that if he had not been corrected in his youth, he would today be a highway robber. Convinced that the teacher's action had been due to a desire for his welfare, Brahmadatta asked his forgiveness and showed him all honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who showed resentment when advised.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Takka Játaka (No.63)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was an ascetic on the banks of the Ganges, from which he rescued Dutthakumárí, daughter of the setthi of Benares, who had been thrown into the flood during a storm by her long-suffering servants. The ascetic succumbed to the wiles of Dutthakumárí and took up his abode with her in a village, where they earned their living by selling takka (curds or dates). He therefore came to be called Takkapandita. One day the village was looted by robbers, and they carried the woman away together with their booty. Living happily with the robber chief, she feared that her former husband might come to claim her; she therefore sent for him with sweet words, planning to have him killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While being beaten by the robber-chief, Takkapandita kept repeating, &quot;Ungrateful wretches,&quot; and, on being asked the reason, related the story. The robber thereupon killed the woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with the robber-chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a passion-tossed monk (J.i.295-99). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka is sometimes referred to as the Takkáriya Játaka, E.g., J.v.446 (16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Táyana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A devaputta. He visited the Buddha at Sávatthi and uttered certain verses in the hearing of the monks, telling of the necessity of following the recluse's calling with energy and sincerity. After his departure the Buddha asked the monks to learn the verses for their own good (S.i.49).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.i.85) says that he was once a dissentient teacher, like Nanda, Vaccha, Kisa, Sankicca, etc., and taught some of the sixty-two views enumerated in the Brahmajála Sutta. By the power of good deeds and by believing in Kamma, he was reborn in the heavens. Discerning from there that at length a really saving Dhamma and Order had been founded, he came to incite the Buddha's disciples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Tittira Játaka (No.37).&lt;/b&gt;-There were once three friends, a partridge (tittira), a monkey and an elephant. Discovering that the partridge was the oldest of them, they honoured him as their teacher and he gave them counsel. Their conduct came to be called the Tittiriya-brahmacariya. The Bodhisatta was the partridge, Moggallána the elephant, and Sáriputta the monkey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the failure of the Chabbaggiyas to show due respect to Sáriputta. Once, when he visited them in company with the Buddha, they refused to provide him with lodging, and he had to sleep under a tree. J.i.217ff; cp. Vin.ii.161; Avadána S.ii.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Tittira Játaka (No.117).&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta was once a leader of five hundred ascetics. One day, a talkative ascetic approached a jaundiced colleague who was chopping wood and worried him by giving him directions on how to do it. The ill man killed him with one blow of the axe. Soon after, a partridge, who used to sing on an anthill near by, was killed by a fowler. The Bodhisatta pointed out to his followers how the death of both was due to their talking too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Kokalika, who is identified with the chattering ascetic. J.i.431f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Tittira Játaka (No.319).&lt;/b&gt;-Once the Bodhisatta was a brahmin ascetic, and Ráhula a decoy partridge used by a village fowler. When the partridge uttered a cry, other partridges would flock to him, and they were killed by the fowler. The partridge was filled with remorse, fearing that he was doing wrong. One day he met the Bodhisatta who set his doubts at rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to </data>
<data>Ráhula's readiness to profit by instruction (J.iii.64ff). It was related by Moggaliputta-Tissa to Asoka, to prove to him that an action becomes a crime only when performed with bad intention. Mhv.v.264.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Tittira Játaka (No.438).&lt;/b&gt;-Once in Benares was a famous teacher who retired into the forest. Men came from all parts to learn from him and brought him many presents. He had in his house a tame partridge, who, by listening to the teacher's exposition, learnt the three Vedas by heart. A tame lizard and a cow were given as presents to the teacher. When the teacher died, his students were in despair, but were reassured by the partridge who taught them what he knew. One day a wicked ascetic came to the hermitage and, in the absence of the students, killed the partridge, the young lizard and the cow. The partridge had two friends, a lion and a tiger, who killed the murderer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ascetic was Devadatta, the lizard Kiságotamí, the tiger Moggallána, the lion Sáriputta, the teacher Mahá Kassapa, and the partridge the Bodhisatta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta's attempts to kill the Buddha.

Hoping to make some money, he asked one of the boys, who was the Bodhisatta, to put his hand into the hollow of the tree, saying that a hedgehog lived there. The boy did so, but, feeling the snake, with great presence of mind, he seized it firmly by the neck and flung it away from him. The snake fell on the doctor and bit him so severely that he died. The boys were brought before the king and charged, but on hearing the Bodhisatta's explanation the king released them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to show how the Bodhisatta practised paññápáramitá. Ananda is identified with the king. J.iii.204ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;p&gt;Tinamutthidáyaka Thera.-An arahant. Ninety-four kappas ago he was a hunter. One day, seeing the Buddha Tissa (v.l. Upatissa) in the forest near Lambaka, he gave him a handful of grass for a seat. He was soon afterwards killed by a lion and was born in the deva-world (A.i.280f). The same story is given elsewhere (A.ii.454f) in somewhat different words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Elder is evidently to be identified with Posiya Thera. ThagA.i.97.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Tapassu (Tapussa) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The householder Tapassu visits Ananda at Uruvelakappa, and expresses surprise that young men in the fullness of life can renounce the pleasures of household life and enter the Order. Amanda takes Tapassu to the Buddha, who is having his siesta at the foot of a tree in the Mahávana, and repeats Tapassu's remark. The Buddha tells Amanda how he himself had attained to Buddhahood by passing through the nine successive stages, the anupubbavihárá. These nine stages consist of the four jhánas, the four áyatanas (ákásánañcáyatana, etc.), and, as the crowning stage, the saññávedayitanirodha (A.iv.438ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tapassu mentioned is evidently identical with the brother of Bhalluka mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (AA.ii.814) on this passage makes no attempt to distinguish him from any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ráhula was his sister's son and was entrusted to him, that he might learn the &quot;deer's tricks.&quot; The young stag followed his instruction diligently and one day, being caught in a net, he feigned death and so made his escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Ráhula. Once, at the Aggálavacetiya, the Buddha, noticing that monks were in the habit of sleeping with novices in the preaching-hall after the sermon, he passed a rule making this a pácittiya-offence. As a result, Ráhula could find no lodging and spent the night in the Buddha's jakes, not wishing to transgress the rule. The Buddha, discovering this, assembled the monks and blamed them for their thoughtlessness, for if they thus treated his son, what might they not do to the other novices. The rule about lodgings was thereupon modified. The story was related to show Ráhula's diligence in following rules (J.i.160ff; cp. Vin.iv.16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka seems also to have been called the Sikkhákáma Játaka. JA.1876, p.516.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

This sutta is followed by a repetition of itself, but with the words &quot;Tathágatas&quot; (plural) substituted for &quot;Tathágata.&quot; (S.v.424f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Having heard the Satipatthána Sutta from Tissa Thera of Ambalena, he was on his way back when he met a wild elephant. By his virtue the elephant was subdued and Tissamahánága took shelter from a storm under the elephant's body. There he developed arahantship. He then went to Viyolaka-Vihára with the elephant, and for thirty years the animal waited on him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death the monk's remains were cremated at Kutumbiya Vihára, and the elephant participated in the celebrations.

He had copper-coloured teeth and tawny skin, and his body was covered with scars. He wished to join a band of thieves, but, for some time, the ringleader refused to admit him on account of his inordinately cruel looks. In the end he was admitted; but when the thieves were captured and no one could be found willing to kill as many as five hundred of them, Tambadáthika agreed to do it for a reward, and slew all his colleagues. He was afterwards appointed public executioner and held the post for fifty-five years. When he became too old to behead a man with one blow, another was appointed in his place, and he was deprived of the four perquisites to which he had, for so many years, been entitled - old clothes, milk porridge made with fresh ghee, jasmine flowers, and perfumes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day on which he was deposed from office, he gave orders for milk porridge to be cooked, and having bathed and decked himself out, he was about to eat, when &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;, out of compassion for him, appeared at his door. Tambadáthika invited the Elder in and entertained him hospitably. When Sáriputta began the words of thanksgiving, his host could not concentrate his thoughts, being worried by memories of his past wickedness. Sáriputta consoled him by representing to him that he had merely carried out the king's orders. At the end of the sermon, Tambadáthika developed the qualities necessary for becoming a Sotápanna. When Sáriputta left, Tambadáthika accompanied him on his way, but on the way back he was gored to death by a cow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cow was a Yakkhiní who also killed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;</data>

Having gone to Kottasála on official business he gave to a monk the food prepared by the people for him. He was then born in Vallaváhagáma and was called Sumana. Later he entered the Order in Bráhmanáráma and became an arahant. A deity of a timbaru-tree provided him and 500 companions with food during the Brahmanatiya famine. Later, during their travels near Kandarájika, the monks, about to eat, had doubts regarding the time because the sun was hidden. Tambasumana threw a stone into the sky, and, making it shine like the sun, dispelled their doubts. The spot came to be called Manisúriya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, at Cullataválagáma, he converted a whole river into ghee from the ford of Válagáma-vihára to Bhuttakatittha, a distance of two yojanas.

Near their dwelling place was a village where grew a tinduka tree, whose sweet fruits were eaten by the monkeys. But the people came and built a village near the tree and the monkeys could no longer take the fruit. One night, when the villagers were asleep, they crept up to the tree and began eating the fruit. A villager gave the alarm and the monkeys were in great danger of being slain when dawn came. But the Bodhisatta comforted them and kept them in good humour until they were rescued by his nephew, Senaka, who set fire to the village, distracting the attention of the people, thus allowing the monkeys to escape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in illustration of the Bodhisatta's sagacity (J.ii.76f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senaka is identified with Mahánáma the Sákiyan. v.l.

The king was greedy, and thinking that his appraiser paid too much for things bought for the palace, he appointed in his place a rustic, whom he happened to see passing. This man fixed prices according to his own fancy. One day a dealer brought five hundred horses from Uttarápatha, and the appraiser valued the whole lot at a single measure of rice. The horse-dealer sought the Bodhisatta's advice, who suggested that the appraiser should be asked to value a measure of rice. The horse-dealer went to the king, and, in the presence of the court, asked the appraiser the value of one measure of rice. The man replied that it was worth all Benares and its suburbs. The ministers laughed, thus putting the king to shame. He dismissed the fool and reinstated the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Láludáyi, who had a dispute with Dabba Mallaputta regarding the distribution of food tickets. The monks thereupon asked Láludáyi to undertake the task. This he did so badly that great confusion ensued, and the matter was reported to the Buddha, who related the above story to show that in the past, too, his stupidity had deprived others of their profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Láludáyi is identified with the false appraiser.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second of the six deva-worlds, the first being the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Cátummahárájika&lt;/a&gt; world. Távatimsa stands at the top of Mount &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sineru')"&gt;Sineru&lt;/a&gt; (or Sudassana). &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; is king of both worlds, but lives in Távatimsa. Originally it was the abode of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura')"&gt;Asuras&lt;/a&gt;; but when&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagha')"&gt;Mágha&lt;/a&gt; was born as Sakka and dwelt with his companions in Távatimsa he disliked the idea of sharing his realm with the Asuras, and, having made them intoxicated, he hurled them down to the foot of Sineru, where the Asurabhavana was later established.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief difference between these two worlds seems to have been that the Páricchattaka tree grew in Távatimsa, and the Cittapátali tree in Asurabhavana. In order that the Asuras should not enter Távatimsa, Sakka had five walls built around it, and these were guarded by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga')"&gt;Nágas&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/garudaa')"&gt;Supannas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumbhanda')"&gt;Kumbhandas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yakkha')"&gt;Yakkhas&lt;/a&gt; and Cátummahárájika devas (J.i.201ff; also DhA.i.272f). The entrance to Távatimsa was by way of the Cittakútadvárakotthaka, on either side of which statues of Indra (Indapatimá) kept guard (J.vi.97). The whole kingdom was ten thousand leagues in extent (DhA.i.273), and contained more than one thousand pásádas (J.vi.279). The chief features of Távatimsa were its parks - the Phárusaka, Cittalatá, Missaka and Nandana - the Vejayantapásáda, the Páricchatta tree, the elephant-king Erávana and the Assembly-hall Sudhammá (J.vi.278; MA.i.183; cp. Mtu.i.32). Mention is also made of a park called Nandá (J.i.204). Besides the </data>
<data>Páricchataka (or Párijáta) flower, which is described as a Kovilára (A.iv.117), the divine Kakkáru flower also grew in Távatimsa (J.iii.87). In the Cittalatávana grows the Ásávatí creeper, which blossoms once in a thousand years (J.iii.250f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the custom of all Buddhas to spend the vassa following the performance of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamaka_paatihaariya')"&gt;Yamakapátiháriya&lt;/a&gt;, in Távatimsa. Gotama Buddha went there to preach the Abhidhamma to his mother, born there as a devaputta. The distance of sixty-eight thousand leagues from the earth to Távatimsa he covered in three strides, placing his foot once on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yugandhara')"&gt;Yugandhara&lt;/a&gt; and again on Sineru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent three months in Távatimsa, preaching all the time, seated on Sakka's throne, the Pandukambalasilásana, at the foot of the Páricchattaka tree. Eighty crores of devas attained to a knowledge of the truth. This was in the seventh year after his Enlightenment (J.iv.265; DhA.iii.216f; BuA. p.3). It seems to have been the frequent custom of ascetics, possessed of iddhi-power, to spend the afternoon in Távatimsa (E.g., Nárada, J.vi.392; and Káladevala, J.i.54).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; paid numerous visits to Távatimsa, where he learnt from those dwelling there stories of their past deeds, that he might repeat them to men on earth for their edification (VvA. p.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka Commentary mentions several human beings who were invited by Sakka, and who were conveyed to Távatimsa - e.g. Nimi, Guttila, Mandhátá and the queen Sílavatí. Mandhátá reigned as co-ruler of Távatimsa during the life period of thirty-six Sakkas, sixty thousand years (J.ii.312). The inhabitants of Távatimsa are thirty-three in number, and they regularly meet in the Sudhammá Hall. (See </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sudhammaa')"&gt;Sudhammá&lt;/a&gt; for details). A description of such an assembly is found in the Janavasabha Sutta. The Cátummahárájika Devas (q.v.) are present to act as guards. Inhabitants of other deva- and brahma-worlds seemed sometimes to have been present as guests - e.g. the Brahmá Sanankumára, who came in the guise of Pañcasikha. From the description given in the sutta, all the inhabitants of Távatimsa seem to have been followers of the Buddha, deeply devoted to his teachings (D.ii.207ff). Their chief place of offering was the Cúlámanicetiya, in which Sakka deposited the hair of Prince Siddhattha, cut off by him when he renounced the world and put on the garments of a recluse on the banks of the Nerañjará (J.i.65). Later, Sakka deposited here also the eye-tooth of the Buddha, which Doha hid in his turban, hoping to keep it for himself (DA.ii.609; Bu.xxviii.6, 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gods of Távatimsa sometimes come to earth to take part in human festivities (J.iii.87). Thus Sakka, Vissakamma and Mátali are mentioned as having visited the earth on various occasions. Mention is also made of goddesses from Távatimsa coming to bathe in the Anotatta and then spending the rest of the day on the Manosilátala (J.v.392).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital city of Távatimsa was Masakkasára (Ibid., p.400). The average age of an inhabitant of Távatimsa is thirty million years, reckoned by human computation. Each day in Távatimsa is equal in time to one hundred years on earth (DhA.i.364). The gods of Távatimsa are most handsome; the Licchavis, among earth-dwellers, are compared to them (DhA.iii.280). The stature of some of the Távatimsa dwellers is three-quarters of a league; their undergarment is a robe of twelve leagues and their upper garment also a robe of twelve leagues. They live in mansions of gold, thirty leagues in extent (Ibid., p.8). The Commentaries (E.g., SA.i.23; AA.i.377) say </data>
<data>that Távatimsa was named after Magha and his thirty-two companions, who were born there as a result of their good deeds in Macalagáma. Whether the number of the chief inhabitants of this world always remained at thirty-three, it is impossible to say, though some passages, e.g. in the Janavasabha Sutta, lead us to suppose so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, as in the case of Nandiya, who built the great monastery at Isipatana, a mansion would appear in Távatimsa, when an earth-dweller did a good deed capable of obtaining for him birth in this deva-world; but this mansion would remain unoccupied till his human life came to an end (DhA.iii.291). There were evidently no female devas among the Thirty-three. Both Máyá and Gopiká (q.v.) became devaputtas when born in Távatimsa. The women there were probably the attendants of the devas. (But see, e.g., Jálini and the various stories of VvA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were many others besides the Thirty-three who had their abode in Távatimsa. Each deva had numerous retinues of attendants, and the dove-footed (kaktgapádiniyo) nymphs (acchará) of Távatimsa are famous in literature for their delicate beauty. The sight of these made Nanda, when escorted by the Buddha to Távatimsa, renounce his love for Janapadakalyání Nandá (J.ii.92; Ud.iii.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Jambudípa excelled the devas of Távatimsa in courage, mindfulness and piety (A.iv.396). Among the great achievements of Asadisakumára was the shooting of an arrow as far as Távatimsa (J.ii.89).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Távatimsa was also known as Tidasa and Tidiva (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He heard from the Pacceka Buddhas, who took their meals in the palace, that he would become king of Takkasilá if he could reach it without falling a prey to the ogresses who waylaid travellers in the forest. Thereupon, he set out with five of his brothers who wished to accompany him. On the way through the forest the five in succession succumbed to the charms of the ogresses, and were devoured. One ogress followed the Bodhisatta right up to the gates of Takkasilá, where the king took her into the palace, paying no heed to the Bodhisatta's warning. The king succumbed to her wiles, and, during the night, the king and all the inhabitants of the palace were eaten by the ogress and her companions. The people, realising the sagacity and strength of will of the Bodhisatta, made him their king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Janapada-Kalyáni Sutta (q.v.). The monks said it must be very hard not to look at a janapada-kalyáni, but the Buddha denied this and related the above story (J.i.393ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka seems also to have been called the Takkasilá Játaka (J.i.470).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the grove was a monastery where the Buddha seems to have stayed on several occasions. It is said (D.ii.116) that on one such occasion the Buddha gave Ananda the chance of asking him to live for a whole kappa, but Amanda failed to make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near the Tapodáráma was the Tapodakandárá. They were both far from Rájagaha, and monks would come from afar late at night and, in order to test Dabba Mallaputta's powers, ask him to provide lodgings for them (Vin.ii.76; iii.159).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On discovering his real parentage, he killed Chambhí, and, having taken the throne, sent for his brother, Cúlaní, who was then in exile, and crowned him king (J.vi.469, 473). It is said (J.vi.474) that, later, Cúlaní was displeased because Tikhinamantí ceased to attend at the palace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It seems to have been customary for the king to take a ceremonial bath in the Tissavápi, after his coronation festival (E.g., Mhv.xxvi.7; xxxv.38; MT.645), and, on this occasion, the Lambakannas formed the king's bodyguard (See, e.g., Mhv.xxxv.16, 38). The road from Mahiyangama to Anurádhapura lay along the edge of the Tissavápi (Mhv.xxxvi.59).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

Todeyya.-A Mahásála brahmin, mentioned in a list of eminent brahmins gathered together at Icchanankala and Manasákata (D.i.235; Sn., p.115). Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.399; AA.ii.554) that his permanent residence was at Tudigáma; hence his name. He was, very probably, the father of Subha, who is called Todeyyaputta (MA.ii.802). Subha's father was, we know, chaplain to Pasenadi and, though exceedingly rich, was a great miser; after death he was born in his own house as a dog of whom Subha was very fond. When the Buddha visited Subha the dog barked, and the Buddha chided it, addressing it by the name of Todeyya. Subha was greatly offended but the Buddha proved the identity of the dog by getting him to show Subha some of his father's buried treasure. The dog was later born in hell (MA.ii.962f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was in Candalakappa a Mango-grove belonging to the Todeyyabrahmins (M.ii.210). A Todeyya-bráhmana was also the owner of the Mango-grove at Kámandá (S.iv.121). The Anguttara Nikáya (A.ii.180) mentions the pupils of the Todeyya-brahmin speaking ill of Eleyya because the latter followed the teachings of Rámaputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Todeyya.-A disciple of Bávarí (SN.vv.1006). He visited the Buddha, and his questions, with the answers given by the Buddha, are given in the Todeyya-mánava-pucchá (SN.vv.1088-91). He became an arahant (SNA.ii..597).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Tapassu, Tapussa.&lt;/b&gt;-A merchant of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ukkalaa')"&gt;Ukkala&lt;/a&gt;. He and his friend, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhallika')"&gt;Bhalluka&lt;/a&gt; (Bhalliya), while on their way to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;, saw the Buddha at the foot of the Rájáyatana tree, in the eighth week after the Enlightenment. Urged by a deity, who had been their relation, they offered the Buddha rice-cakes and honey in a bowl provided by the Four Regent Gods. They became the first lay disciples of the Buddha, and their formula of Refuge contained no reference to the Sangha (Vin.i.3f; A.i.26; UdA.54; J.i.80).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Theragáthá Commentary (i.48f), Tapassu and Bhalluka were brothers, sons of a caravan leader of Pokkharavatí. Some time later they visited the Buddha at Rájagaha, where he preached to them; Tapassu, thereupon, became a Sotápanna, while Bhalluka entered the Order and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhí Buddha they were brahmins of Arunavatí. Hearing that two caravan leaders, Ujita and Ojita, had given the first meal to the Buddha, they gave alms to the Buddha and his monks, and wished for a similar privilege for themselves under a future Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha, they were sons of Gopála-setthi, and for many years provided the monks with milk rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.207f) says that the deity, who caused Tapassu and Bhalluka to give alms to the Buddha, was their mother in their previous birth. The Buddha gave them, for worship, eight handfuls of his hair, which he obtained by stroking his head. They took the hair with them to their city - which, according to this account, was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asitanjana')"&gt;Asitañjana&lt;/a&gt; - and there built a cetiya, from which rays of blue light issued on </data>

The boar helped him in his work, fetching his tools and so on. When he grew up to be a big, burly beast, the carpenter let him go free in the forest. There he joined a herd of wild boars which was being harassed by a fierce tiger. Tacchasúkara made all the preparations for a counter-attack, digging pits and training all the members of the herd in their various duties, and their several positions at the time of attack. Under his guidance they succeeded in killing the tiger and greedily devouring the corpse. Tacchasúkara was told that there was a sham ascetic who had helped the tiger to eat the boars. The herd attacked the ascetic, who climbed up a fig-tree, but they uprooted the tree and devoured him. They consecrated Tacchasúkara as their king, making him sit on a fig-tree, and sprinkling water on him from a conch-shell, with its spirals turned right-wise, which the ascetic had used for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence arose the custom of seating the king on a chair of figwood and sprinkling him with water from a conch-shell at his coronation. The story was related in connection with the Thera Dhanuggahatissa (q.v.). Spies of Pasenadi had heard him discuss with the Thera Datta the plan of campaign which should be adopted if Pasenadi wished to defeat Ajátasattu. This was repeated to Pasenadi, who followed the suggestion and captured Ajátasattu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhanuggahatissa is identified with Tacchasúkara.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Tathágata&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epithet of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, used by the Buddha in referring to himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (DA.i.59-67; AA.i.58-63; MA.39-43; UdA.128ff., etc.) give eight (sometimes expanded to sixteen) explanations of the word, which shows that there was probably no fixed tradition on the point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explanations indicate that the name can be used for any arahant, and not necessarily only for a Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term was evidently pre-Buddhistic, though it has not yet been found in any pre-Buddhistic work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Thulla-Nandá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nun, one of four sisters who all joined the Order, the others being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandaa')"&gt;Nandá&lt;/a&gt;, Nandavatí and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sundari_nandaa')"&gt;Sundarinandá&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thulla-Nandá appears to have had charge of a large company of nuns, all of whom followed her in various malpractices (Vin.iv.211.239, 240, 280). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thulla-Nandá was well-versed in the Doctrine and was a clever preacher. Pasenadi, king of Kosala, is mentioned as having come on two occasions to hear her preach, and was so pleased with her eloquence that he allowed her to persuade him to give her the costly upper garments he was wearing (Vin.iv.254-256). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was greedy for possessions, and was later accused of misappropriating gifts intended for other nuns (Vin.iv.245-246, 258). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was fond of the company of men, and frequented streets and cross-roads unattended that she might not be hindered in her intrigues with men (Vin.iv.270, 273). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She seems to have regarded with sympathy women who succumbed to temptation and to have tried to shield them from discovery (Vin.iv.216, 225, 230f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She bribed dancers and singers to sing her praises. She could brook no rival, and especially disliked &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddaa')"&gt;Bhaddá&lt;/a&gt;, whom she deliberately annoyed on more than one occasion (Vin.iv.283, 285, 287, 290, 292).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was fractious and would wish for something, but when that was procured for her, would say it was something else she really wanted (Vin.iv.248, 250). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was evidently an admirer of Ananda, and was greatly offended on hearing that Mahá Kassapa had called Ananda &quot;boy,&quot; and gave vent to her displeasure at what she considered Kassapa's presumption. </data>
<data>But we are told that soon after that she left the Order (S.ii.219ff ). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She befriended Arittha when he was cast out of the Order (Vin.iv.218). The Suvannahamsa Játaka was related in reference to her, and she is identified with the brahmin's wife of the story (J.i.474f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>

When they had grown up in the houses of the courtiers who had charge of them, the king had them summoned one by one, and asked them for advice as to how a king should reign. Each admonished the king in eleven stanzas, and, at the suggestion of the admiring populace, they were given respectively the ranks of general, treasurer, and commander-in-chief. When the king died, the people wished to make Jambuka king, but, having inscribed rules of righteousness on a golden plate, he disappeared into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the admonitions delivered by the Buddha to the king of Kosala. The king of the past was Ananda, Kundaliní was Uppalavaná, Vessantara, Sáriputta and Jambuka the Bodhisatta (J.v.109-25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verses uttered by Jambuka are often quoted. E.g., J.i.177; vi.94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Telappanáli&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village near Ujjeni. When Mahá Kaccána went there on his way to Ujjeni, a poor girl of noble family, seeing him return empty handed from his alms-round, invited him into her house, cut off her beautiful hair, sent a slave-girl to sell it, and with the price of it gave alms to Kaccána, keeping herself out of sight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elder sent for her, and, at the sight of him, her hair grew as before. Candappajjota, hearing of the incident, sent for her and made her his queen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gave birth to a son called, after his maternal grandmother, Gopála, and his mother thereafter came to be called Gopálamátá.

Tissa Sutta.-The story of Tissa (No.14) being taken to the Buddha because he complained of distaste for the monk's life. By means of an allegory the Buddha teaches him how he can attain Nibbána, and promises to help him to do so. S.iii.106f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Tissa Sutta.-Moggallána, hearing the Buddha report a conversation between two devatás at Gijjhakúta, visits the Brahmá Tissa in order to discover if the devas had knowledge of saupádisesa and anupádisesa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tissa tells him what he knows and Moggallána describes his visit to the Buddha. The Buddha tells him that Tissa had omitted to mention the animittavihárí puggala, which he then proceeds to explain (A.iv.77f; cp. A.iii.332f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was once an ascetic and while walking one day along the banks of the river Candabhágá, saw the Buddha Siddhattha and scattered over him timira flowers, paying him homage. Soon afterwards he was killed by a lion (Ap.i.126f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Timirapupphiya Thera.-An arahant.

Bu.xxiv.18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Tusita.-The fourth of the six deva worlds (A.i.210, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four hundred years of human life are equal to one day of the Tusita world and four thousand years, so reckoned, is the term of life of a deva born in Tusita (A.i.214; iv.261, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Sakadágámins (e.g., Purána and Isidatta) are born there (A.iii.348; v.138; also DhA.i.129; UdA.149, 277).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the rule for all Bodhisattas to be born in Tusita in their last life but one; then, when the time comes for the appearance of a Buddha in the world, the devas of the ten thousand world systems assemble and request the Bodhisatta to be born among men. Great rejoicings attend the acceptance of this request (A.ii.130; iv.312; DhA.i.69f; J.i.47f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama's name, while in Tusita, was Setaketu (Sp.i.161), and the Bodhisatta Metteyya (q.v.), the future Buddha, is now living in Tusita under the name of Nathadeva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tusita world is considered the most beautiful of the celestial worlds, and the pious love to be born there because of the presence of the Bodhisatta (Mhv.xxxii.72f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tusita is also the abode of each Bodhisatta's parents (DhA.i.110). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king of the Tusita world is Santusita; he excels his fellows in ten respects - beauty, span of life, etc. (A.iv.243; but see Cv.lii.47, where the Bodhisatta Metteyya is called the chief of Tusita). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those reborn in Tusita are also </data>
<data>mentioned Dhammika, Anáthapindika, Malliká, the thera Tissa (Tissa 10), Mahádhana and Dutthagámani. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tusita devas are so-called because they are full of joy (tuttha-hattháti Tusitá) (VibhA.519; NidA.109).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inhabitants of Tusita are called Tusitá. They were present at the Mahásamaya (D.ii.161).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Tirokudda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the five suttas included in the Khuddaka-Pátha. Departed spirits haunt their old dwelling places and their compassionate kinsmen should bestow on them in due time, food, drink, etc. and also give gifts to the monks in their name. Thus will they be happy (Khp., p.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta was preached on the third day of the Buddha's visit to Rájagaha. On the previous night, Petas had made a great uproar in Bimbisára's palace. In the time of Phussa Buddha, they had been workmen entrusted with the task of distributing alms to the Buddha and his monks, but they had been negligent in their duties and had appropriated some of the gifts for themselves. As a result, they suffered for a long period in purgatory and became Petas in the time of Kassapa Buddha. Kassapa told them that in the future, Bimbisára, who had once been their kinsman, would entertain the Buddha Gotama and make over the merit to them. They had long waited for this occasion and when Bimbisára failed to fulfil their expectations, they made great outcry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha explained this to Bimbisára, who thereupon gave alms in the name of the Petas, thus making them happy. It was on this occasion that the Sutta was preached. KhpA.202ff; cp. PvA.19ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Having become a wandering recluse he went about questioning recluses and brahmins, but not finding satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day he beard the Buddha preach, entered the Order and became an arahant (Thag.747-68; ThagA.ii.24ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When Tekicchakárí was grown up his father, by his wisdom and policy, incurred the jealousy and suspicion of Cánakka, minister of Candagutta, who had him thrown into prison. Tekicchakárí, in his fright, fled, and, taking refuge with a forest-dwelling monk, entered the Order and dwelt in the open air, never sleeping and heedless of heat and cold. Mára, in the guise of a cowherd, tried to tempt him, but he developed insight and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was born in a physician's family and cured a monk, named Asoka, and many others. Eight kappas ago he was a king named Sabbosadha (Thag.384-6; ThagA.i.440f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Tikicchaka of the Apadána (i.190).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was a ne'er-do-well, and Kálí, having helped him with money which he proceeded to squander, refused to give him any more. But a patron of Kálí, seeing his condition, gave him his clothes on entering Kálí's house - it being the custom for those who patronised a courtesan, to be provided with clothes during their stay in her house - and had to walk away naked. J.iv.248f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tundila&lt;/b&gt;.-A parrot, who had a tiger as friend. For their story see Ras.i.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was in the Kosala country and belonged to the Mallas, and was once visited by the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Thúna were unbelievers and, hearing of the Buddha's contemplated visit, they removed all the boats of the river which the Buddha had to cross, closed all the wells except one and determined not to honour the Buddha in any way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha arrived with the monks through the air and a slave-woman, coming to fetch water, saw them and gave them to drink. For this, she was beaten by her husband and killed; but she was reborn in Távatimsa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, by his power, caused the water in the wells to overflow and flood the village. The inhabitants begged his forgiveness and invited him and the monks to stay there. Vv.i.8; VvA.45ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha's visit is described at Ud.vii.9 (UdA.377), but no mention is made there of the slave-woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city called Thúna is mentioned in the Mahájanaka Játaka (J.vi.62, 65).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A story is related of how, in her wisdom, she managed to procure an adequate reward for a man who had saved another from drowning at the risk of his own life (J.vi.398). We are told that, while her son was still young, she committed adultery with the chaplain Chambhí, poisoned her husband, and made the chaplain king. Later, Chambhí wished to kill Cúlani, but Talatá saved his life by sending him to the royal cook (J.vi.471f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a son by Chambí, called Tikhinamantí (J.vi.474). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is identified with Cullanandiká (J.vi.478). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

As the man stood impaled he looked up, and seeing a crow flying through the air, hailed him and sent a message to his wife, informing her where his possessions lay concealed and asking her to enjoy them (J.ii.443f; cp. Nos.34 and 216). In the introduction to the Játaka it is said that the paccuppannavatthu is given in the Puppharatta Játaka and the atítavatthu in the Indriya Játaka. There seems to be an error here, for the first story of the Indriya Játaka (J.iii.461ff) (unless another story is meant) bears no resemblance to the Kámavilápa Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

They were captured by a fowler and brought to the court of Dhanañjaya, king of Benares, where they were paid great attention. Later, a monkey, Kálabáhu, was added to the collection of animals, and the people in the palace lost interest in the parrots, much to the annoyance of Potthapáda. Soon, however, the children became frightened of the monkey's tricks and he was sent away, just as Rádha had prophesied to his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was Potthapáda, and Devadatta, Kálabáhu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's attempt to kill the Buddha by letting loose Nálágiri.

The Buddha visited the Kalyáni country in the eighth year after the Enlightenment, in company with five hundred monks, on the second day after the full-moon of Vesákha and, seated on the spot where the Kalyáni-Cetiya was later built, he preached to the Nágas and their king Maniakkhika, at whose invitation he had come (Sp.i.89; Mhv.i.63, 75ff; Dpv.ii.42, 53; J.ii.128).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a king reigned in Kalyání named Kalyani-Tissa, who had a daughter &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vihaaradevii')"&gt;Viháramahádeví&lt;/a&gt;. According to the legends connected with her, Kalyání was at one time much further from the sea than it is now. The sea swallowed up several leagues of land (Mhv.xxii.12ff). King Yatthála-Tissa built a five-storied pásáda in the town, which was later restored by Parakkamabáhu II (Cv.lxxxv.64).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kalyáni district formed the fighting base of several campaigns.

He became intimate with her, and the Bodhisatta was conceived then and there. The king gave the woman his signet ring, with instructions that if the child was a boy, he should be brought to the court with the ring. When the Bodhisatta grew up his playmates nicknamed him &quot;No-father.&quot; Feeling ashamed, he asked his mother about it and, on hearing the truth, insisted on being taken to the king. When confronted with the child, the king was too shy to acknowledge his parentage, and the mother, having no witness, threw the child into the air with the prayer that he should remain there if her words were true. The boy, sitting cross-legged in the air, requested the king to adopt him, which request was accepted, his mother being made queen consort. On his father's death he became king under the name of Katthaváhana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; on his refusal to recognize the claim to the throne of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/viduudabha')"&gt;Vidúdabha&lt;/a&gt;, his son by Vásabha-Khattiyá (J.i.133ff; iv.148; DhA.i.349).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the story has some connection with that of Dusyanta and Sakuntalá, as given in the Mahábhárata and later amplified by Kálidása in his drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The grotto was at one time the residence of a large number of pigeons (kapotá), hence the name (UdA.244). On one occasion Sáriputta, having recently shaved his head, was seated there wrapt in samádhi, and a yakkha, passing overhead with his friend to an assembly of yakkhas, yielded, despite the warning of his friend, to the temptation to give a knock on the monk's shining head. The yakkha immediately fell down and was swallowed up in the fires of hell. Sáriputta had but a slight headache after the blow, which was, it is said, heavy enough to crush an elephant (Ud.39f; Thag.vs.998f; PsA.494).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Visuddhi-magga (p.380), Sáriputta entered into a trance at the very moment the blow was dealt him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, during the course of his wanderings, stayed there several times; the exact place of his residence is, however, mentioned only once, namely the fire-hut of a brahmin of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaaradvaaja')"&gt;Bháradvája-gotta&lt;/a&gt;, where a grass mat was spread for him by the brahmin. It was on this occasion, according to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiya_s')"&gt;Mágandiya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.501), that, after a long discussion, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiya')"&gt;Mágandiya&lt;/a&gt; was converted.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several important discourses were preached at Kammásadamma, among them being:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanidana_s')"&gt;Mahánidána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.55; S.ii.92)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasatipatthana_s')"&gt;Mahásatipatthána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.290; M.i.55)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananjasapaaya_s')"&gt;Ánañjasappáya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.26)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya (S.ii.107f) contains a discourse on handling experiences by way of casual relations, and the Anguttara (A.v.29f ) a discourse on the ten noble states (ariyavásá), both preached at Kammásadhamma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; (SA.ii.89) says that the people there were full of wisdom and their food was nutritious; it was therefore a compliment to their intellectual calibre that the Buddha should have preached these suttas to them.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in Buddhaghosa's day the name of the township had two different spellings, and two etymologies are suggested for the names (DA.ii.483). The place was called Kammásadamma because it was here that the man-eating ogre, &lt;a href="kammasapaada')"&gt;Kammásapáda&lt;/a&gt; was tamed and civilized by the Bodhisatta. (Kammáso ettha damito ti, Kammásadamam-Kammáso ti Kammásapádo porisádo vuccati.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spelling Kammásadhamma is explained on the ground that the people of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuru')"&gt;Kuru&lt;/a&gt; country had a code of honour called the Kuruvattadhamma; it was here that Kammása (already referred to) was converted and made to accept this code, hence the name of the township. (Kururatthavásínam kira kuruvattadhammo, tasmim Kanamáso játo, tasmá tam thánam &quot;Kammáso ettha dhamme játo&quot; ti Kammásadhammam ti vuccati.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Játakas, there are two places of the same name, called Cúlakammásadamma and Mahákammásadamma respectively, to distinguish one from the other. Mahákammásadamma, which was evidently the original place, was founded on the spot where the porisáda of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasutasoma_jat_537')"&gt;Mahásutasoma Játaka&lt;/a&gt; was tamed (J.v.411), while Cúlakammásadamma was the name given to the place where &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jayaddisa_jat_513')"&gt;Jayaddisa&lt;/a&gt; showed his prowess by his spiritual victory over the ogre in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jayaddisa_jat_513')"&gt;Jayaddisa Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.35f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Divyávadána (pp.515f), the place is called Kammásadamya. It was the residence of the nuns &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanduttara')"&gt;Nanduttará&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mittakali')"&gt;Mittákáliká&lt;/a&gt; (ThigA.87, 89).&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kálacampá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city in Anga; it was sixty leagues from Mithilá, with which it was connected by a cart-road (J.vi.31f). To Kálacampá came sages from the Himalaya to procure salt and sour condiments (J.vi.256). There lived Punnaka's relations (J.vi.274). Varuna, the Nága king, tells Vidhúra that he (Varuna) and his wife were once inhabitants of Kálacampá (J.vi.317). Kálacampá is probably another name for Campá (q.v.); in fact, the name Campá is used more than once in reference to Kálacampá (E.g., J.vi.32). According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.131), Sona Kolivisa was born in Kálacampá; the Theragáthá Commentary (ThagA.i.544), however, speaks of his birthplace as Campá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kási &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kási (Kásika).&lt;/b&gt;-One of the sixteen Mahájanapadas (A.i.213, etc.), its capital being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Báránasí&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Buddha, it had been absorbed into the kingdom of Kosala, and Pasenadi was king of both countries (D.i.288; M.ii.111). The Mahávagga (Vin.i.28l), however, mentions a Kásika-rájá (king of Kási?) who sent a robe to Jívaka. Buddhaghosa (see Vinaya Texts ii.195, n.2) says that this was a brother of Pasenadi and son of the same father. He was probably a sub-king of Pasenadi. Pasenadi's father, Mahákosala, on giving his daughter in marriage to Bimbisára, allotted her a village of Kási (Kásigáma, q.v.) as bath money (J.iv.342; J.ii.403; SA.i.110,120f, etc.). Even at this time, however, the memory of Kási as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men's minds. It is very frequently mentioned as such in the Játakas and elsewhere. Kási was once ruled by the Bháratas, one of whom, Dhatarattha, was its king in the time of Renu (D.ii.235f). There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kási and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other. In one such war, Dígháti (q.v.), the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of Kási, but Díghíti's son Díghávu won back the kingdom (Vin.i.334; J.iii.487; DhA.i.46). In another war the Kási king, Mahásílava, was taken captive by the ruler of Kosala, but his kingdom was later restored to him (J.i.262, etc.; see also i.409; UdA.123).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional name of the king of Kási from time immemorial was evidently Brahmadatta (q.v.), and references to kings of that name abound in the Játakas. Sometimes the king is referred to merely as Kási-rájá. Among other kings of Kási mentioned are Kikí (M.ii.49) and Kalábu </data>
<data>(J.iii.39). The extent of the Kási kingdom is given as three hundred leagues (J.v.41; also iii.304, 391).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of Kási is generally given as Báránasí, but it is said that when Asoka was king of Kási his capital was in Potali (J.iii.155), and another king, Udaya-bhadda, had his seat of government in Surundha (J.iv.104ff). It is possible that these cities did not form part of the regular kingdom of Kási, but became annexed to it during the reigns of some of the more powerful kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kási was evidently a great centre of trade and a most populous and prosperous country. Frequent mention is made of caravans leaving Kási to travel for trade. One highway went through Kási to Rájagaha (Vin.i.212) and another to Sávatthi (Vin.ii.10; Mhv.v.114). Kási was famed for her silks, and Kási-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts, each robe being valued at one hundred thousand. (See, e.g., J.vi.151, 450; see also Addhakási). Mention is also made of the perfumes of Kási (Kási-vilepana (J.i.355) and Kási-candana (A.iii.391; UdA.332)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides those already referred to, other names of places mentioned in literature as belonging to Kási, are Vásabhagáma, Macchikásanda (the kammantagáma of Anáthapindika), Kítágiri and Dhammapálagáma (q.v.). Kási and Kosala are frequently mentioned together. (E.g., A.v.59).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kási, or Kásika.&lt;/b&gt;-A city, the birthplace of Phussa Buddha (Bu.xix.14; J.i.41). There he preached the Buddhavamsa (BuA.193). The city is probably to be identified with Benares, which is sometimes referred to as Kásipura (E.g., DhA.i.71; J.v.54; vi.165; M.i.171; DhsA.35; Cv.xli.37). It is also called Kásipurí (PvA.19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kapila&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-Father of Pippali-mánava, who is better known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;. ThagA.ii.142; but see ThagA., p.73, verses 56, 57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-A brahmin, the Bodhisatta born as the chaplain of Upacara, king of Cetiya. The king had promised the post of chaplain to his friend Korakalamba, Kapila's younger brother, and when reminded of his promise, undertook to recover it from Kapila's son who had been given the appointment at Kapila's request. The king, in spite of Kapila's warning, attempted to fulfil his promise by lying, and, as a result, he was swallowed up in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aviici')"&gt;Avíci&lt;/a&gt;. The king's five sons thereupon sought Kapila's protection, and at his advice they left Ceti and founded five cities: &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/h')"&gt;Hatthipura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assapura')"&gt;Assapura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihapura')"&gt;Síhapura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarapancaala')"&gt;Uttarapañcála&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/daddara')"&gt;Daddarapura&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.454ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapila is sometimes called Kapilatápasa (J.v.273) and Kapila-isi (J.v.267). His encounter with the Cetiya king is evidently a famous legend, and is often referred to. E.g., in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankicca_jat_530')"&gt;Sankicca Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.267).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-A brahmin, the Bodhisatta. When the sons of Okkáka went into voluntary exile and were looking for a spot on which to found a city, they came upon Kapila in his hermitage in Himavá by the side of a lake. He was versed in the science of Bhúmicála, and was, therefore, </data>
<data>acquainted with the qualities associated with various sites. He knew that any city built on the site of his hermitage would become the capital of Jambudípa and that its inhabitants would be invincible. He therefore advised them to found a settlement there. They followed his advice and named the settlement Kapilavatthu after him (q.v.). A hermitage was built near it for the use of Kapila. DA.i.259f; MT.132f; SnA.ii.353; see also Mtu.i.348ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk. He was the younger brother of Sodhana, his mother being Sádhiní and his sister Tápaná. The whole family entered the Order of Kassapa Buddha; Sodhana learnt meditation and became an arahant. Kapila learnt the three Pitakas and, intoxicated with his learning, disagreed with everybody, right or wrong. He would heed no admonition, and followed a life of evil conduct in which he was followed by his mother and sister. One day, when Kapila was reciting the Pátimokkha, none of the other monks gave the responses, and in anger he declared that there was neither Dhamma nor Vinaya. Thus he put obstacles in the way of religion, and was reborn in Avíci.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aciravatii')"&gt;Aciravatí&lt;/a&gt; as a fish, Kapilamaccha. Some fishermen, having caught him, took him to the king of Kosala. At the fish was of golden hue, the king took him to the Buddha, desiring an explanation of his colour. When the fish opened his mouth the whole of Jetavana stank. The Buddha questioned the fish and made him confess his sins. Struck with remorse, the fish died and was reborn once more in hell. DhA.iv.37ff; SnA.ii.305f; SA.ii.152; see also UdA.179f; ThagA.i.356.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-A sinful monk who lived in a village near Kosambí. He was the friend of Pandaka (q.v.). Vin.iii.67.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-The Majjhima Commentary (i.75) has a reference to a monk named Kapila, who, because of his greed for possessions, is described as having been reborn with a flaming sangháti-robe (sanghátí pi ádittá hoti). This probably refers to a monk mentioned in the Párájiká (Vin.iii.107), who was reborn as a peta and who could be seen going through the air with his robe aflame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-A city, called Kapilanagara, capital of Pañcálarattha. This city once had Cúlani-Brahmadatta as its king (PvA.161; Netti.142). Perhaps it is this city that is mentioned in the Dípavamsa (iii.17; MT.127) as having been the capital of Abhítatta (v.l. Ajitajina) and his eighty-four thousand descendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-A brahmin of Ságala, in the Madda Country, father of Bhaddá-kapilání. Kapila's wife was Sucímatí (ThagA.73; Ap.ii.583). The word Kapiláni is probably derived from his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-A great physician, mentioned in a list of eminent physicians of old. Mil.272.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-A minister of King Vohárika-Tissa. He was appointed by the king to suppress the Vetulya doctrine and hold the heretics in check. Mhv.xxxvi.41; Dpv.xxii.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-An ancient teacher of philosophy, mentioned together with Kanáda as having taught that the soul was limitless (na antavá) (UdA.339; see also Svetasvatara Upanisad v.2, and Rámáyana i.40). He is probably identical with the founder of the Sánkhya system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Kapila&lt;/b&gt;.-An ancient seer, probably of Ceylon, in whose honour Parakkamabáhu I. built the Kapila-vihára near </data>
<data>Pulatthipura, with many-storied buildings, frescoes, and other ornamentations. Cv.lxxviii.92ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kappina Sutta.-Mahá-Kappina visits the Buddha who, seeing him from afar, tells the monks that Mahá-Kappina is highly gifted and of wondrous power, a gifted preacher and radiant; one of those who bad gained the object of renunciation. The Buddha proceeds to say how one, clothed in wisdom and virtue, is best among beings, and how the Noble One is best of shining objects in that he shines always (S.ii.284). The verses of this sutta are also quoted elsewhere. E.g., D.iii.98; Dh.vs.387.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kappina Sutta.-The Buddha sees Mahá-Kappina sitting cross-legged, with body erect, and mindful. He points him out to the monks, telling them that he can sit thus without shaking or wavering of his body because he has developed concentration on breathing. S.v.315f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kásáva Játaka (No.221)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poor man of Benares, having entered into a contract with ivory workers to supply elephants' tusks, went into the forest clad in a Pacceka Buddha's yellow robe, and standing in the path of the elephants, slew the last one of the herd each day. The Bodhisatta, being the leader of the elephants, on discovering what was happening, threatened to kill the man; but receiving his promise never to visit the forest again, he let him go free on account of his robe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trader, coming to Rájagaha on business, contributed a magnificent yellow robe to an almsgiving organised by the townspeople. There was some dispute as to whether Sáriputta or Devadatta should receive the robe; but the majority favouring Devadatta, he cut the robe into strips and wore it in great style. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he related the above Játaka story, in which Devadatta is identified with the huntsman. J.ii.196ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kappatakura Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He belonged to a poor family of Sávatthi, where he went about in rags, pan in hand, seeking for rice grains (kura), hence his name (&quot;Rags and Rice&quot;). Later he sold grass for a living. One day, having heard a monk preach, he entered the Order, leaving his rags in a certain place; seven times disaffection grew within him, and each time he took up his rags and put them on. When the Buddha heard of this he admonished the monk severely, and the latter, greatly disturbed, developed insight and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a householder, and offered the Buddha a few ketakí-flowers on the banks of the river Vinatá (Thag.199f.; ThagA.i.320ff). He is probably identical with Ketakapupphiya of the Apadána. Ap.ii.449.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was of the Chaddanta race, and was left by his mother and discovered by a fisherman, Kandula, after whom he was named. Mhv.xxii.62f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He grew up to be of great strength. When Dutthagáminí's father died, his younger son, Tissa, took possession of the queen-mother and of Kandula, the state-elephant, and fled, but in the battle between the brothers, Kandula shook himself free from Tissa and went over to Dutthagáminí, whom he served to the end of his life. Kandula took a prominent part in the campaign against the Damilas, distinguishing himself particularly in the siege of Vijitapura (Mhv.xxiv.15, 89). In the single combat between Elára and Dutthagáminí. Kandula attacked Elára's elephant, Mahápabbata, and disabled him (Mhv.xxv.5-83). It is said that once the warrior Nandhimitta seized Kandula by his tusks and forced him on to his haunches, and Kandula nursed a grudge against him until Nandhimitta rescued him from being crushed under a gate-tower which fell on him during his attack on Vijitapura.

He had taken seven vows: to wear no garments, to be chaste, to maintain himself only by spirituous drinks and flesh, eating no rice or gruel, never to go beyond the Udena shrine, the Gotamaka shrine, the Sattamba shrine, and the Bahuputta shrine. Sunakkhatta once visited him and asked him questions, but Kaláramatthuka would not listen, and showed resentment at being interrogated. When Sunakkhatta reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha predicted that the ascetic would, before long, wear garments, be married, eat rice and gruel, go beyond the limits he had until now observed, and fall in fame. And so it came to pass (D.iii.9ff). v.l. Kandaramasuka, Kalára, Kalára-matthaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

After that, while on a pilgrimage to Benares, they were entertained by a householder who was also named Mandavya. Dípáyana journeyed on while the ascetic Mandavya remained in a cemetery near Benares. There some robbers left some stolen goods outside his hut, and Mandavya, being charged before the king, was impaled, but by virtue of his great powers he continued to live. Dípáyana came to see his friend, and finding him thus and learning that he bore no ill-will towards anyone, took up his abode under his impaled body. Gouts of gore fell from Mandavya's wound on to Dípáyana's golden body and there dried, forming black spots; so he came to be called Kanha-Dípáyana. When the king heard of this, he had Mandavya released with a piece of the stake still inside him, on account of which he came to be called Áni-Mandavya. Dípáyana returned to the householder Mandavya, whose son Yaññadatta he helped to heal by an Act of Truth, the child having been bitten by a snake while playing ball. The lad's parents then performed acts of Truth. In this declaration of Truth it was disclosed that Dípáyana had no desire for the ascetic life, that the father did not believe in the fruits of generosity, and that the mother had no love for her husband. They thereupon admonished each other and agreed to mend their ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mandavya of the story was Ananda, his wife Visákhá, the son Ráhula, Áni-Mandavya Sáriputta and Kanha-Dípáyana the Bodhisatta (J.iv.27ff). The occasion for the story is the same as that for the Kusa Játaka (q.v.). In one verse Kanha-Dípáyana is addressed merely as Kanha (Ibid., p.33).&lt;/p&gt;</data>

It is said that the king had the sacred texts written down with a short summary in honour of this Elder. Geiger thinks (Cv.

It was from the earliest times the residence of eminent monks, such as Dhammagutta (the Earth-shaker) and his five hundred colleagues (Mhv.xxxii.51) and of Godattatthera (MA.i.100). Here a thera, called Pindapátiya, once recited the Brahmajála Sutta, and the earth trembled as he finished his recital (DA.i.131). Near the vihára was the village of Káladíghavápigáma, where monks who lived in the monastery went for alms (SnA.i.70; AA.i.13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Kanittha-Tissa built in this monastery an uposatha-hall (Mhv.xxxvi.17). Vijayabáhu III. restored the vihára, which had been damaged by the Damilas, and reconstructed the cetiya, crowning it with a golden finial. He also built a gate-tower on the eastern side (Cv.lxxxi.59f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fourteenth century Alagakkonára seems to have bestowed great patronage on the monastery, and to have done many things for its improvement (See Ceylon Antiquary and Literary Register i.152; ii.149, 182).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the fifteenth century the monastery was evidently considered one of the chief centres of the Sangha in Ceylon, for we find that the monks, sent by Dhammaceti from Rámañña to Ceylon, received their ordination in the símá of Kalyáni-vihára, and that on their return they consecrated a símá in Pegu known as the Kalyáni-símá (Bode, op. cit., 38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ninety-four kappas ago he was a king named Gopaka (?), and seeing the Buddha Siddhattha, accompanied by his monks, walking in the city, the king, from his balcony, scattered kanavera-flowers over them.

Kála.-Son of Anáthapindika.-As he showed no signs of piety his father, feeling very distressed, made a solemn promise to give him a thousand if he kept the fast-day. Kála won the money, and the next day he was promised a thousand if he would listen to the Buddha preaching and learn a single verse of the Dhamma. He listened to the Buddha's sermon, but by the will of the Buddha he could not keep in mind a single verse until the sermon came to an end. He then became a sotápanna and accompanied the Buddha and the monks to his father's house. There, when in the presence of them all Anáthapindika gave Kála the money, he refused to accept it, and the Buddha explained what had happened. DhA.iii.189ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kála.-An Elder. A certain woman ministered to him as though he were her son, but when she expressed her desire to see the Buddha, Kála tried to dissuade her from doing so. One day she visited the Buddha without telling Kála of her intention, and when he learnt where she had gone he hurried to the Buddha and tried to prevent him from preaching to her, in case she should stop caring for him. DhA.iii.155f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kála.-Minister of Pasenadi. He was grieved when the king spent his fortune in giving alms to the Buddha and his monks at the Asadisa-dána ; the Buddha, knowing his thoughts, spoke but a single stanza by way of thank offering at the end of the dána lest Kála's head should split in seven pieces in anger. When the king learnt, on inquiry, why the Buddha had so acted, he dismissed Kála from his service. DA.ii.654f; DhA.iii.186-8; also ii.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kála.-An Elder of Kosala. He joined the Order in his old age and lived in the forest with his friend Junha. Once the </data>
<data>question arose between them as to which part of the month was cold, and being unable to decide the question, they sought the Buddha, who preached to them the Máluta Játaka (q.v.).

The name given by his wife to the Ájívaka Upaka (ThigA.i.223) because he was dark in complexion (ThigA.i.226).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Kála.-King of the Nágas; see Mahákála.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Kála.-A young stag, son of the Bodhisatta; a previous birth of Devadatta. The story is given in the Lakkhana Játaka.

The village produced a revenue of one hundred thousand, and was given to the queen for her bath and perfume money.

Kálí.&lt;/b&gt;-Called &lt;b&gt;Kururaghariká&lt;/b&gt;, described among laywomen as the best of those who believe even from hearsay (anussavappasannánam) (A.i.26).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the mother of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sona')"&gt;Sona Kutikanna&lt;/a&gt;, and her husband belonged to Kururaghara in Avanti. When with child, she came to her parents in Rájagaha, and there, while enjoying the cool breeze on the balcony above her roof (síhapañjare), she overheard the conversation which took place between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satagira')"&gt;Sátágira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata')"&gt;Hemavata&lt;/a&gt; on the excellences of the Buddha and of his teaching; as she listened, faith in the Buddha grew in her and she became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. That same night Sona was born. Later, Kálí returned to Kururughara and there waited on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')"&gt;Mahá Kaccána&lt;/a&gt;. When Sona entered the Order under Kaccána and visited the Buddha, she gave him a costly rug to be spread in the Buddha's chamber. When Sona returned home after this visit, Kálí asked him to preach to her in the same way as he had earlier preached to the Buddha, earning the applause of the Buddha himself and of the devas of the ten thousand worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kálí was considered most senior among the women who became &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápannas&lt;/a&gt; (sabbamátugámánam antare pathamakasotápanná sabbajetthiká) (AA.i.133ff; SnA.i.208f). She was the constant companion and staunch friend of Kátiyáni (AA.i.245). Kálí's wish to attain to the eminence which she reached in this life was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha when </data>
<data>she heard a laywoman declared pre-eminent among those who had begotten faith by hearsay (AA.i.247).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation between her and Mahá Kaccána is related in the Kálí Sutta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kálí&lt;/b&gt;.-Maidservant of Videhiká of Sávatthi. Videhiká was reputed to be gentle and meek, but Kálí, who was a bright girl and a good worker, thought she would test her mistress. One day she rose late and, on being reproved, spoke very lightly of her fault. Finding that Videhiká lost her temper, Kálí repeated her offence several times, until one day her mistress struck her with a lynch-pin, drawing blood from her head. Kálí ran out and roused the neighbourhood with her shrieks. Videhiká's reputation for meekness was no more. The story is related in the Kakacúpama Sutta. M.i.125f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Kálí&lt;/b&gt;.-A Mára-woman, sister of Dúsí (q.v.) and mother of the Mára of the present age (Vasavatti?). (M.i.333)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Kálí.&lt;/b&gt;-A crematrix (chavadáhiká) of Sávatthi. Seeing Mahákála meditating in the cemetery, she cut off from a recently cremated body its thighs and arms, and making of them a sort of milk bowl, placed it near where the Thera sat. Thag.151; ThagA.i.271; more details are given in DhA.i.57ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Kálí.&lt;/b&gt;-A &lt;b&gt;Yakkhiní&lt;/b&gt;. A householder, having a barren wife, married another woman, a friend of the former. Every time a child was conceived, the first wife brought about a miscarriage; at last the second wife died through a miscarriage and, on her deathbed, vowed to take her revenge. After several births, in which each, alternately, devoured the children of the other, the second wife became an ogress named Kálí and the first wife was born in a good family. Twice the ogress ate the latter's children; on the third </data>
<data>occasion Kálí was occupied in Vessavana's service and the child was left unhurt. On his naming day the parents took him to Jetavana, and there, as the mother was giving suck to her child, while her husband bathed in the monastery pool, she saw the ogress and, being terrified, dashed into the monastery where the Buddha was preaching. The guardian deity, Sumana, prevented Kálí's entrance, but the Buddha, having heard the story, sent for Kálí and preached to her, whereupon she became a sotápanna. The Buddha persuaded the two women to become friends, and Kálí lived in the house of the other; but being uncomfortable there and at various other lodgings provided for her, she ultimately lived outside the village. There her aid was invoked for the protection of the crops, and eight ticket-foods (salákabhatta) were established in her honour. DhA.i.37ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Kálí.&lt;/b&gt;-Wife of Kotúhalaka (q.v.) and mother of Kápi (DhA.i.169). When Kotúhalaka was born as Ghosaka, she became his wife after having saved his life (DhA.i.181). See Ghosaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Kálí.&lt;/b&gt;-A maidservant of the setthi of Kosambí. She it was who secured Ghosaka (q.v.) for the setthi, and when the setthi wished to get rid of him, the task was entrusted to her. Seven times she tried to have him killed, but all her attempts failed (DhA.i.174ff). Later Kálí confessed her share in the setthi's crime, and seems to have been forgiven by both Ghosaka and his wife (DhA.i.186f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Kálí.&lt;/b&gt; -A courtesan of Benares, sister of Tundila. She earned one thousand a day. Tundila was a debauchee, and so wasted her money that she refused to give him any more and had him cast out. A merchant's son, visiting Kálí, found Tundila in despair and gave him his own clothes. When the latter left the courtesan's house the next day, the clothes </data>
<data>with which he had been provided according to custom were taken away, and he had to walk the streets naked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is included in the Takkáriya Játaka (J.iv.248ff). In the stanzas of the Játaka Kálí is also called Káliká.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the great-grandson of Mahánága, brother of Devánampiya-Tissa, and his father was Gothábhaya (Mhv.xv.170f; Mbv.132). His capital was at Mahágáma. He had as wife, Deví (better known as Viháradeví), daughter of Tissa, king of Kalyáni, who had been cast into the sea to expiate her father's crimes (Mhv.xxii.20ff). Their children were Dutthagámani Abhaya and Saddhá-Tissa. Kákavanna-Tissa gathered round him all the foremost Sinhalese warriors of the time so that they should be available for Gámani, when the time came for his campaign against the Damilas (Mhv.xxiii.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the start Kákavanna-Tissa was very reluctant to allow his son to make preparations for such a campaign (Mhv.xxii.82f), so much so that, in exasperation, the young prince once sent his father some female ornaments to indicate that the king was no man (Mhv.xxiv.4). Kákavanna-Tissa was very pious, and is said to have built sixty-four viháras, sixty-four years being also the length of his reign (Mhv.xxiv.12; see also AA.i.279). Among the religious edifices built by him were the Tissamaháráma, the Cittalapabbatavihára (Mhv.xxii.23) and the Mahánuggala Cetiya. He was cremated at Tissamaháráma (xxiv.8, 13). He evidently received his name on account of his dark colour. The Dípavamsa (Dpv.xviii.20; were their names Mahilá and Samantá?; see also xix.21f) speaks of Kákavanna-Tissa's daughters as having been proficient in the history of the, Religion (saddhammavamsakovidá).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was once a milakkka in India and looked after a Pacceka Buddha. One day he gave the Pacceka Buddha a meal of ripe jack-fruit. On another occasion, when the Pacceka Buddha visited his house in </data>

The latter sought the Pacceka Buddha to kill him, but, seeing him in mid air putting on his robe, he was filled with wonder and asked the Pacceka Buddha's forgiveness. Later he was born in a hunters' village near Amaruppala-lena, his name being Amaruppala, and did various good deeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was called Kákavanna-Tissa because he knew the speech of crows.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Kathá-Vatthu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth of the seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. (Sometimes called the third, e.g., in Mbv.94). It seems to have been compiled when the contents of at least the Dhammasanganí, the Vibhanga and Patthána were already accepted as orthodox. Tradition ascribes its compilation to Moggaliputta-Tissa at the end of the Third Council, held under Asoka's patronage; at Pátaliputta (Mhv.v.278; Dpv.vii.41, 56-8). It was rejected by some on the ground that it was set forth two hundred and eighteen years after the Buddha's death, and was hence only a disciple's utterance; but the Commentaries take the view that the mátiká, the principles taught therein, were laid down by the Teacher himself, and that the whole work should be regarded as the utterance of the Buddha, just as the Madhu-pindika Sutta, preached really by Mahá-Kaccána, is considered as the Buddha's teaching. The book consists of twenty-three chapters, and is a collection of discussions (kathá) and refutations of the heretical views of various sects on matters connected with theology and philosophy. The Buddha's authority is accepted as final. See the very valuable Preface to the Points of Controversy, by Mrs. Rhys Davids, vii ff See also Rhys Davids on &quot;Questions discussed in the Kathá-Vatthu,&quot; J.R.A.S.1892.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has sometimes been suggested (E.g., J.R.A.S.1915, 805ff ) that Asoka's Rock Edict IX. has been influenced by the Kathá-Vatthu. The Therí Khemá, chief of the Buddha's women disciples, describes herself as being &quot;Kathávatthuvisáradá,&quot; (ThigA.135) thus strengthening the theory that the Kathá-Vatthu was known already in the Buddha's time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Udána Commentary (UdA.94) refers to a Kathávatthupakarana-Tika for details of certain points raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He built a monastery in Nigrodháráma, near Kapilavatthu, and once, during robe-making time, many monks lived there. On this occasion the Buddha preached the Mahá-Suññatá Sutta.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;KANJIN &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(687 A.C.   763 A.C.), also referred to as Kanshin or Ganjin, was a Chinese monk (Chien-Chen) from Yangchou who came to Japan in 754 A.C. and founded the Ritsu (vinaya) school of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that ever since the inception of the Buddhist Order in Japan, Japanese monks seem to have been somewhat lax in disciplinary matters. To remedy this shortcoming emperor Shomu tried to invite an able teacher from China. For this purpose he, in 738 A.C. sent out the two monks Eiei and Fusho to China. These two met Kanjin and invited him to Japan. But as the reigning Chinese emperor was not favourably disposed towards Buddhism, Kanjin could not obtain imperial sanction for this journey. However, Kanjin being determined to make the trip secretly made several unsuccessful attempts to sail to Japan. It is said that on the fifth attempt he lost his sight. Yet, undaunted he tried once more and successfully reached Japan in April 754 A.C. He is said to have been accompanied by fourteen monks, three nuns and twenty-four lay male disciples. Kanjin and his followers are said to have brought along with them a number of vinaya commentaries and important texts of the Tendai School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his arrival in Japan Kanjin was ceremonially received by Shomu and a special monastery called Toshodaiji was built for his residence. At Kanjin's request a special Ordination Hall (kaidán), the first of its kind in Japan, was built in the precincts of the Todaiji temple in Nara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The establishment of the kaidan at Todaiji in Nara is a significant event in the history of Japanese Buddhism. At the first ordination ceremony itself over fourhundred are said to have taken part. Since the kaidan was at Nara all who wished to obtain ordination had to go </data>
<data>there. Official permission was not granted to establish any kaidan outside Nara, and hence, schools of Buddhism that prevailed at Nara enjoyed an almost monopolistic influence over the ordination. This was finally put to an end only by the zealous efforts of Degyo Daishi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

(Pp.12ff; also found in the Samyutta i.171ff under the name of Kasí-Sutta and included in the Paritta). It contains the story of the Buddha's visit to Kasí-Bháradvája given above. The Buddha tells him that in his work as a Teacher are to be found all the elements of a farmer's duties: faith is the seed, insight the plough, mindfulness the ploughshare and goad, energy the burden-bearing team. The harvest produced by the sowing is nibbána and the food ambrosia, free from suffering and sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kacchapa Játaka (No. 178).-The story of a tortoise who would not leave the lake where he lived even though all the other tortoises, knowing there would be a drought, swam in time to the neighbouring river. When the drought came, he buried himself in a hole. There he was dug up by the Bodhisatta who was digging for clay, having been born as a potter. The tortoise's shell was cracked by the potter's spade and he died, having uttered two verses on the folly of clinging too much to things. The Bodhisatta took his body to the village and preached to the villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a young man of Sávatthi who, when the plague broke out in his house, listened to his parents' advice and escaped through a hole in the wall. When the danger was past he returned and rescued the treasure hoarded in the house and, one day, visited the Buddha with many gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with the tortoise of the story. J.ii.79-81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kacchapa Játaka (No. 215).-The story of a tortoise who became friendly with two geese living in the Cittakúta mountain. One day the geese invited the tortoise to their abode, and when he agreed they made him hold a stick between his teeth, and seizing the two ends flew away with him. The children of the village, seeing them, started shouting, and the tortoise, being of a talkative nature, opened his mouth to reprimand them and fell near the palace of the king of Benares, crushing himself to death. The Bodhisatta, who was the king's minister, seized the opportunity for admonishing his master, who was an inveterate talker, on the virtues of silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tortoise is identified with Kokálika, in reference to whom the story was related (J.ii.175-8; repeated also in </data>
<data>DhA.iv.91f). For details see the Mahátakkári Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kacchapa Játaka (No. 273).-The story of how a monkey insulted a tortoise by introducing his private parts into the tortoise as the latter lay basking in the sun with his mouth open. The tortoise caught hold of the monkey and refused to release him. The monkey went for help, and the Bodhisatta, who was an ascetic in a hermitage near by, saw the monkey carrying the tortoise. The Bodhisatta persuaded the tortoise to release the monkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the quarrelsome ministers of the king of Kosala.

It is said that once a certain raja went there for a picnic and, having over-drunk, fell asleep. His retinue, seeing him sleeping, wandered away, looking for flowers and fruits. A snake, attracted by the smell of liquor, approached the king from a neighbouring tree-trunk, and would have bitten him had not a tree-sprite, assuming the form of a squirrel, awakened him by her chirping. In gratitude the rájá gave orders that thenceforth the squirrels in that locality should be fed regularly. UdA.60; SnA.ii.419. According to some, it was the gift of a merchant named Kalandaka (Beal: Romantic Legend, p.315); Tibetan sources identify the rájá with Bimbisára and say that the snake was a reincarnation of the owner whose land the king had confiscated. According to these same sources the name is Kalantaka and is described as the name of a bird (Rockhill: op. cit., p.43).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalandakanivápa was evidently a favourite resort of the Buddha and his monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Veluvana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kandaraka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when the Buddha was at Campá, on the banks of Lake Gaggará, he was visited by Pessa, the elephant trainer's son, and Kandaraka, the Wanderer. Pessa saluted the Buddha and sat down, while Kandaraka, after his salutation, remained standing. Surveying the assembly of monks gathered round the Buddha and observing their great silence, Kandaraka expressed his admiration of the Buddha's training. The Buddha explained that all Buddhas school their disciples in the four satipatthánas. Pessa stated that it was far more difficult to train men than animals. The Buddha agreed and enumerated the four kinds of people in the world: those who torment themselves, torment others, torment both themselves and others, and, lastly, those who torment neither, dwelling beyond appetites, in bliss and holiness. Pessa stated that he respected only the fourth class, and having given his reasons went away. The Buddha expressed his regret that Pessa could not wait to hear the differences between these four kinds of people; and at the request of the monks the Buddha proceeded to describe them (M.i.339ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Káranapálí asked him what he thought of the Buddha, and Pingiyání sang his praises, illustrating his meaning with various figures of speech. Convinced by Pingiyání's earnestness, Káranapálí knelt on the ground and expressed his homage to the Buddha (A.iii.236ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (AA.ii.636) says that the man's name was Pála (or Pálí), and he was called Káranapálí because he supervised the business of various chieftains' families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was &quot;of good stock, well informed, a good speaker and a scholar of ability.&quot; He visited the Buddha at Opasáda, where he interrupted a conversation which the Buddha was holding with some aged brahmins; they rebuked him for interrupting his elders, but Cankí (q.v.), who happened to arrive at that moment, interceded on his behalf. The Buddha, knowing that Kápathika had questions to ask of him, gave him an opportunity for so doing, and there followed a discussion on various points, detailed in the Cankí Sutta. At the end of the discussion the youth declared himself a disciple of the Buddha (M.ii.168ff). In the Sutta the Buddha addresses Kápathika as Bháradvája, perhaps because he belonged to that gotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was once the centre of Buddhism in South India and was one of the places of pilgrimage visited by Hiouien Thsang. He mentions that during his stay there three hundred monks came to Káñcipura from Ceylon, fleeing from the political disturbances in that country (Beal, op. cit., ii.228f; CAGI.627). In Pali Literature the locality is noteworthy as the birthplace of the Commentator Dhammapála and perhaps also of Anuruddha, author of the Abhidhammattha-Sangaha (P.L.C.113, 169). Some identify Káñcipura with Satiyaputta of Asoka's Rock Edict II. E.g., J.R.A.S., 1918, 541f; see also Bhandarkar, Anct. Hist. of Deccan pp.47, 52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She was so called because, at birth, she was laid on a black skin (J.vi.487). When Vessantara retired to the forest, his wife and children accompanied him to Vankagiri. Later, both Kanhájiná and her brother Jáli were given to Jújaka as slaves and were ill-treated by him. For sixty leagues they travelled with him, led and guarded by the gods, till they came to the court of their grandfather Sañjaya, king of Sivi, and there they were released, Kanhájiná's price being one hundred elephants, one hundred male and female slaves, etc. The children afterwards rejoined their parents and lived happily at the court (J.vi.513ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kanhájiná is identified with Uppalavanná (J.vi.593). In the verses she is sometimes called Kanhá (E.g., 546, 548, 553).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessantara's gift of his children is considered the greatest of his gifts.

Kámabhú Sutta.-Kámabhú visits Ananda at Ghositáráma in Kosambí and asks him whether the senses are the bonds of objects or objects the bonds of senses. Ananda answers that neither is true; the bond is the desire and lust that arise owing to the senses and the objects with which they come in contact. The Buddha, for instance, is free from such bondage (S.iv.165).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same question is asked of Sáriputta by Kotthita, who receives the same reply (S.iv.162f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kámabhú Sutta.-Cittagahapati visits Kámabhú at Ambátakavana in Macchikásanda and is asked to solve a riddle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;dl&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nelango setapacchádo ekáro vattatí   ratho&lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anígham passa áyantam chinnasotam   abandhanam.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citta explains this as referring to the Arahant and points out the significance of each term (S.iv.291f). In the Udána (p.76; UdA.370f; cf. DhsA.398) the words of the riddle are mentioned as having been used by the Buddha in reference to Lakuntaka-Bhaddiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kámabhú Sutta.-Records another visit of Citta to Kámabhú. Citta asks a series of questions about the activities of the body, speech and mind and their cessation.

His son was the husband of Cúla-Subhaddá (q.v.) and therefore son-in-law of Anáthapindika. Kálaka was a follower of the Niganthas. When the Buddha visited Sáketa, at the request of Cúla-Subhaddá, Kálaka listened to his sermon and became a sotápanna. He gave his park, the Kálakáráma, to the Buddha, and built a vihára there after removing, by force, the Niganthas, who were in possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AA.ii.482f; but see DhA.iii.465f, where the setthi's name is given as Ugga of Uggapura; see also Dvy.402, where the name of the city is Pundavardhana and that of Anáthapindika's daughter Sumágadhá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

They were present at the Mahá Samaya, and are spoken of as being of a fearsome shape (D.ii.259; also DA.iii.789.820). They are the very lowest of the Asura groups, and the Buddha warns Sunakkhatta that Korakkhattiya will, after his death from epilepsy, be born among them; and it did so happen (D.iii.7f; J.i.389). Bodhisattas are never born among the Kálakañjakas (J.i.44; BuA.224). Sometimes (E.g., J.v.187; PvA.272), when Asuras are mentioned, the Commentaries explain the word as meaning the Kálakañjakas. Beings born among them suffer from excessive thirst, which they are unable to quench even by immersing themselves in the Ganges. (For a story of one of them see VibhA.5). The Kájakañjakas resemble the petas in shape, sex-life, diet and length of life, and they intermarry with them (Kvu.360).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Among the latter were four gods from Távatimsa, wearing wreaths of kakkáru-flowers, the fragrance of which filled the town. When men wondered at the fragrance, the gods showed themselves and their wreaths. Men asked for these flowers, but the gods explained that they could only be worn by those possessed of certain virtues. The king's chaplain, hoping to deceive the gods, claimed possession of these virtues. The wreath was put on his head and the gods disappeared. The chaplain was seized with great pain in his head, but on trying to remove the wreath he found it impossible to do so. When he had suffered for seven days, the king, hoping to save his life, held another similar festival at which the gods were again present. The chaplain confessed his guilt and obtained relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the vomiting of blood by Devadatta when his disciples left him. v.l. Kakkdru, Takkaru. J.iii.86-90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It deals with the origin of contentions and disputes. Disputes arise about objects which one holds dear; such affection is the result of desire, etc. It forms the eleventh sutta of the Atthakavagga of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sutta_nipata')"&gt;Sutta Nipáta&lt;/a&gt; (Sn.vv.862ff; SnA.361, 551ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the discourse was specially meant for those in the Assembly, whose temperament was malicious (dosacaritánam) (MNidA.222).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are told that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Mahá-Pajápatí&lt;/a&gt; heard the sutta and renounced the world.

The Buddha, seeing a brahmin felling trees on the banks of the Aciravatí and preparing a field for corn, spoke to him. He spoke again to the brahmin on several other occasions, when the latter was engaged in various operations in the field. The brahmin, pleased by the Buddha's courtesy, resolved to invite him to a meal when the harvest should be gathered. But the day before the reaping of the corn heavy rains fell, the river was flooded and the corn all washed away. The Buddha had foreseen that this would happen and visited the brahmin to console him. It was on this last occasion that this sutta was preached. At the end of the sermon the brahmin became a sotápanna (Sn.vv.766-71; SnA.ii.511ff; J.iv.167f; cp. DhA.iii.284f; see also MNid.i.1ff). In the Kámaníta Játaka he is referred to as Kámaníta-bráhmana. J.ii.212.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Káma Sutta.-Contains questions asked by a deva and the Buddha's answers thereto. A man should not become a slave or surrender himself as prey to others and speech should always be gentle. S.i.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Káma or Kámaguna Sutta.-On the five kinds of pleasures of the senses. A.iv.458; S.v.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day Khadiravaniya took Kandagalaka with him into the acacia wood (khadiravana) and gave him insects from the acacia trees. As Kandagalaka ate them, pride rose in his heart and, feeling he could get food without his friend's assistance, he told him so. In spite of the warning of Khadiravaniya, Kandagalaka pecked at an acacia trunk, broke his beak, and fell down dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in connection with Devadatta's attempts to imitate the Buddha, these attempts ending in his own ruin. Kandagalaka is identified with Devadatta. J.ii.162-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His name is spelt as &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kániska in inscriptions. On   coins it appears, in Greek script, as &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kanérki, or   in the genitive &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kanerkou which some scholars read   as &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kanéshki and &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kanéshkou.  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kasmir tradition gives the variant  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kanistha which become &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kanit'a   in Chinese. &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Alberuni refers to him as  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kanik&lt;a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[1]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are different theories regarding   the nationality of Kaniska. It is widely accepted that he is of  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Yuch-chi origin. It is said that during the 2nd   century B.C. the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Yuch-chi, a Mongoloid nomadic   tribe of Central Asia, was forced out of their pasture lands by their more   powerful neighbours, the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Hiung-nu. Being thus   driven out they migrated westwards and in the course of their migration   conquered the Wu sun tribe and settled down in the basin of the  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;&lt;span class="GramE"&gt;lli&lt;span class="GramE"&gt;   river. Here they were divided into two branches of which the minor   branch (&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Siao-yueh-chi) deflected southwards and   settled down along the Tibetan border while the major branch (Ta-&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;yueh-chi) </data>
<data>  proceeded forwards, defeated the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Sakas and settled   down in the conquered territory. From there they were again expelled by the   son of the dead Wu sun chieftain. Resuming their march, they finally occupied   Bactria and Sogdiana and by about the 1st century B.C. gave up their nomadic   habits and adopted a more settled life, Here they were divided into five   groups of whom the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kusánas (&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kueishuang)   overpowered the rest and united the whole tribe under Kadphises I (i.e.,  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kujula Kadphises) who captured some regions of   North West India. He was succeeded by his son Kadphises II (i.e.,  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Wima Kadphises) who annexed further Indian  &lt;span class="GramE"&gt;territory.

<data>  and B.N. Puri prefer the date 144 on the ground that the latest archaeological   discoveries made at &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Begram in Afghanistan by  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Ghrishman add more weight to it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The view put forward by Fleet, and   supported by R. Otto &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Franke and J. Kennedy, that   Kaniska preceded the two Kadphises, is no longer held as valid&lt;a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[15]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.   The excavation done at &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Taxila has shown that the   coins of the Kaniska group of the Kusána kings were found in the upper (i.e.   later) strata of earth while those of the Kadphises group were in the lower   (i.e., earlier) strata. The connection between Kadphises II and Kaniska is not   known. However, the evidence provided by the coin finds in which the coins of   Kadphises II and Kaniska were found together proves that they were close to   each other in time. It is plausible to hold that Kaniska succeeded Kadphises   II after a short interregnum&lt;a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[16]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is quite certain that Kaniska   succeeded to a fairly large kingdom of Kadphises II. He expanded this kingdom   by annexing more territory both in India and in Central Asia.

<data>  He also conquered Kashmir, Punjab and Sind. In Kashmir he erected numerous   monuments and founded a city called &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kaniskapura,   now represented by the village &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kanispor. Outside   India his rule extended to Afghanistan, Bactria, Kashgar, Khotan and Yarkand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though he seems to have cherished a   marked preference for Kashmir he had his capital at &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  Purusapura, the modern Peshawar which lay in the main route from   Afghanistan to the Indus plain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kaniska was a renowned warrior. His   most daring military feat is his conquest of Kashgar, Yarkand and Khotan,   which were dependencies of China, Kadphises II is also said to have tried to   accomplish this feat without success and consequently had to pay tribute to   China. Kaniska not only freed his kingdom from this obligation, but also took   away hostages from a dependency of China&lt;a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[25]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.   Some scholars are of opinion that on a previous occasion Kaniska, too, tasted   defeat at the hands of the Chinese general Pan-&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;chao.&lt;a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[26]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kaniska treated his hostages with   utmost consideration, providing them with places of residence suitable for   each season. These hostages are said to have resided in the  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Sha lo ka monastery probably situated in the hills </data>
<data>  of &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kapisa (modern Kafiristan) and in monasteries   at &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Gandhára and Eastern Punjab (&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Cinabhukti).&lt;a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[27]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Buddhist tradition describes Kaniska   as a great patron of Buddhism comparable to Asoka: Legends about his   conversion closely resemble those of Asoka, and it is probable that these   legends were based on stories detailing Asoka's conversion. Tradition   represents Kaniska, before his conversion to Buddhism, as one who had no faith   either in right or wrong and as a person who did not pay any attention to   Buddhism. It is also said that the immediate cause of his conversion was the   deep remorse he felt over the bloodshed in his numerous wars.&lt;a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[28]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Though this tradition is based on facts it could be surmised that it was built   up by the Buddhists making Kaniska to emulate Asoka and show the ennobling   influence of Buddhism on him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Epigraphical and numismatic records do   not provide clear testimony regarding his conversion and religion. Vincent   Smith surmises&lt;a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[29]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   that his coins show that his conversion to Buddhism did not take place until </data>
<data>  he had been on the throne for some time. The finest and presumably the   earliest coins bear legends, Greek in both script and language, with images of   the sun and moon under the names Helios and Selene (spelt &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  Saléné on the coins). On later issues, the Greek script is retained but   the language is &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Knotanese, while the reverse of   the coins represents gods worshipped by Greeks, Persians and Indians.&lt;a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[30]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   The coins that bear the images of &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Sákyamuni are   considered to be the latest. Some Indian scholars think that if numismatic   evidence proves anything, it is only his eclecticism, or that his coins only   depict the various forms of faith prevailing in his vast empire.&lt;a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[31]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Despite attempts to adduce evidence to prove that he was not a Buddhist, the   testimony provided by the numerous monuments he has built, as well as his   association with the Buddhist Council held during his reign show that, even if   he was not a Buddhist, he was more bent towards Buddhism than towards any   other religion. An inscription found on a relic casket, too, is taken by some   scholars as evidence to establish that he favoured the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  Sarvástiváda school of Buddhism.&lt;a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[32]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;p&gt;Tradition records that Kaniska studied   Buddhism in his leisure hours under the guidance of &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  Pársva. Tradition also states that he carried off &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  Asvaghosa from &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Pátaliputra.&lt;a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[33]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Even if this story is not accepted it is plausible to hold that Kaniska and  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Asvaghosa were contemporaries and that these two   were associates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two eminent Buddhist scholars  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Vasumitra and &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Nágárjuna   too, are said to be his contemporaries.&lt;a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[34]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Buddhism at that time was a force to reckon with, and despite the possibility   that Kaniska was doing his best to consolidate big vast empire; he adopted   Buddhism to keep abreast of the trends prevalent at the time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to the Buddhist tradition   the greatest service rendered to Buddhism by Kaniska is his convening of the   Buddhist Council during his reign. There are different accounts of this   council. The best known is that of &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hsuan-tsang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[35]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Paramártha in his Life of &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  Vasubandhu gives another version which, though generally considered to   be the same as that of &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Hsuan-tsang, contains   different information.&lt;a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[36]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Táránátha also records an account, which, though   confused, contains important information. It is not relevant at present, to   extract facts from these legendary accounts which are confused and often   discrepant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is said that Kaniska, greatly   puzzled by the conflicting teachings found in different schools, suggested to  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Pársva to summon a council of eminent monks to   obtain an authoritative disposition of the doctrine. There was some difference   of opinion among them as to the venue of the council and they finally decided   to hold it at the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kundalavana vihára in Kashmir.&lt;a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[37]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Vasumitra was elected president with  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Asvaghosa as the Vice president. The members, five   hundred in all composed 100,000 stanzas of &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Upadesa  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Sástra explanatory of the canonical sutras,   100,000 stanzas of Vinaya &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;vibhásá  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;sastra explanatory of the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  vinaya and 100,000 of &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Abhidharma</data>
<data>  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;vibhásá &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;sastra   explanatory of the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Abhidharma. Kaniska is said to   have caused these treatises to be written on copper plates and enclosed them   in stone boxes which he deposited in a &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;stúpa   specially constructed for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is not possible to form a clear   idea about the work accomplished at the Council. Some scholars think that the   chief business of the Council was to collect canonical texts, and to prepare   commentaries of different schools of Buddhism.&lt;a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[38]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tradition seems to connect the rise of  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Máhánánana with Kaniska and with the Buddhist   Council held during his reign.&lt;a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[39]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   The fact that this Council is recognised by the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  Mahánánists&lt;a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[40]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   is also taken as evidence on this point. But a close scrutiny of the available   information regarding the Council as well as the Buddhist activities carried   out by Kaniska shows that this tradition cannot be relied upon. It is a fact   that &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Táránátha observes that all kinds of</data>
<data>  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Maháyánist writing appeared at this time and that   the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Theravádins raised no objection. But he   neither clearly states nor implies that Kaniska personally took any interest   in promoting Maháyána teachings, or that any   Maháyána treatises were composed at that Council. On the other hand, it is   generally regarded that this Council was exclusively a council of the  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Sarvástivádins of northern India and that the  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Maháyánists did not take part in it.&lt;a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[41]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   It is apparent that after holding this Council the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  Sarvástivádin school of Buddhism gained more importance than before.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whatever the tradition is there is no   reasonable ground to hold that Kaniska was responsible for the rise and rapid   spread of &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Maháyánism and that the Council held   during his reign was a Maháyána Buddhist&lt;a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[42]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Council. It is plausible to hold that he was more bent towards  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Sarvástiváda teachings and this is established by   the inscription on the relic casket.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of the numerous &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  stúpas he is said to have built, the most famous is the one at Shah-&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;ji-ki-Dheri   near Peshawar. From the accounts of the Chinese travellers of the fifth and </data>
<data>  seventh centuries it appears that it was one of the wonders at the time. This  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;stúpa is said to have been 130 metres in height,   resting upon a stone substructure 50 metres high, topped by an iron mast 10   metres high with gilded metal discs. It is assumed that the original form of   the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;stúpa as it appeared in the days of  &lt;span class="GramE"&gt;Kaniska, looked quite different from the form that   could be reconstructed from the ruins. It is also believed that it was rebuilt   many times.&lt;a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[43]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reliquary enshrined in the Kaniska   cetiya is also worthy of note. The object is a round pyxis, made of an  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;amalgum of precious metals. The lower hand of the   drum consists of representation in relief of garland bearing  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;erotes and Kusána sovereign, identified by   scholars as Kaniska, between the divinities of the sun and moon; on the side   of the lid is a flock of geese (&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;hamsa). To the top   of the cover are fastened free standing statuettes of the Buddha, flanked by   Indra and &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Brahmá. The most interesting feature of   the object is the Greek name of the maker, &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;agesilas,  &lt;span class="GramE"&gt;the overseer of works at the Kaniska-&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;caitya.   The inscription found on the reliquary also states that it was made &quot;for   acceptance of the teachers of the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Sarvástivádin  &lt;span class="GramE"&gt;school&quot; and this is cited as evidence to prove that </data>

Many scholars believe that  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Gandhára art attained its peak during his reign.&lt;a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[45]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Tradition which credits Kaniska with having built many &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;  &lt;span class="GramE"&gt;stúpas&lt;span class="GramE"&gt;, also   seems to support this contention. According to Benjamin Rowland &quot;The Art of  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Gandhára is, properly speaking; the official art   of the &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Kushán emperor Kaniska and his successors&lt;a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[46]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   (see also, GANDHÁRA).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like Asoka, Kaniska also helped   missionary activities. It was during his reign that Buddhism spread and became   firmly established in central and eastern Asia. There are no records of any   missionaries sent by him. But it is accepted that under his patronage Buddhism   greatly flourished and spread throughout his vast empire. One writer has </data>
<data>  observed that &quot;there was ceaseless missionary activity throughout his vast   empire which extended from &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Madhyadesa in India to   Central Asia. A truly integrated Asian culture came into existence at this   time..,&quot;&lt;a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[47]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   Vincent Smith&lt;a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[48]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   observes that the legend regarding his death possibly may be founded on fact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A statue of Kaniska was discovered by  &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Tokritila, in the village of   &lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Mát.   In this headless statue the king is represented with his right hand resting on   a mace and the left clamping the hilt of the sword. He is dressed in a tunic   reaching down to the knees, and held round the loins by a girdle. He wears   heavy boots with straps round the ankles. Though headless, an inscription   found on it proves conclusively that it represents Kaniska.&lt;a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title&gt;&lt;span class="MsoEndnoteReference"&gt;&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;[49]&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;BIBLIOGRAPHY&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="SpellE"&gt;Bapat,   P.V.

The physicians failed to cure him, and his family were in despair. He resolved that if he recovered he would embrace the religious life; soon afterwards he was cured, became an ascetic and cultivated the abhiññá and the samápatti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a man in Sávatthi who had a like experience. He entered the Order and became an arahant (J.ii.436-8). v.l. Kayanibbinda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When this became known, a rule was passed that no monk should ordain two novices (Vin.i.79); this rule was, however, later rescinded (Vin.i.83). Elsewhere (Vin.i.85), Kantaka is mentioned as being expelled from the Order for having had sexual intercourse with a nun, Kantaká by name. According to the Pacittiya (Vin.iv.138f), Kantaka held the same false views as Arittha (q.v.), and for that reason he was expelled from the Sangha. The Chabbaggiya monks, however, received him into their ranks and gave him every encouragement. In the Samantapásadiká (iv.874) Kantakasámanera is mentioned with Arittha and the Vajjiputtakas, as having been an enemy of the Buddha's religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Jívaka invited him to eat, but he refused. In the end, however, he consented to eat half a myrobalan, which he thought would be harmless, but into which Jívaka had introduced some drug hidden in his finger nail. Káka purged violently and was very alarmed. Jívaka told him that all he desired was for him to be slightly delayed and left him, after having handed over to him the elephant Bhaddavatiká, which he had used in his flight.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kañcanaguhá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cave in the region of the Himálaya, according to one description (J.ii.176; but see J.v.357, where it is said to be near Cittakúta) in the face of the Cittakúapabbata. This cave was the abode of the Bodhisatta when he was born as a lion, as described in the Virocana Játaka (J.i.491f), and again in the Sigála Játaka (J.ii.6). Near by was the Rajatapabbata. This cave was also the dwelling-place of the geese mentioned in the Kacchapa Játaka (J.ii.176), and in the cave grew the Abbhanta-ramba (J.ii.396), the property of Vessavana. In the scholiast to the Hatthipála Játaka (J.iv.484), the Kañcanagúha is mentioned as the abode of the spider Unnábhi and the ninety-six thousand geese who took shelter in it, waiting for the rains to clear. Near the cave was the Chaddantadaha and the Buddha, when he was born as the elephant Chaddanta, made the cave his headquarters (J.v.37f). In this context the cave is described as being in the Suvannapabbata (probably another name for Kañcanapabbata) to the west of the Chaddanta lake, and is said to be twelve leagues in extent. There lived the elephant king with eight thousand companions. Nandatápasa once lived for seven days at the entrance to the cave, going to Uttarakuru for his food (J.v.316, 392).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pákahamsas of great power also lived in the cave (J.v.357, 368), once as many in number as ninety thousand (J.v.381).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sudhábhojana Játaka (J.v.392), the cave is stated to have been on the top of Manosilátala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kañcanagúha is mentioned in literature as the dwelling-place of maned lions (kesarasíhá) (E.g., UdA.71, 105).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Finding it impossible to remove the gold as a whole, he cut it into four and carried it home easily. The story was related in reference to a monk who wished to leave the Order because he was frightened by all the rules his teachers asked him to learn and obey. The Buddha gave him three rules - to guard voice, body and mind - and the monk won arahantship. Even a heavy burden becomes light if carried piece by piece.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kankhávitaraní&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A commentary, also called Mátikatthakathá, by Buddhaghosa on the Pátimokkha of the Vinaya Pitaka. The colophon also contains a summary, a kind of uddána, of the contents. It is stated that the work was written at the request of a thera named Sona, and Buddhaghosa declares most emphatically that there is not even a single word in the book which is not in conformity with the Canon or the Commentaries of the Mahávihára (p.204, ed. Hewavitarane Bequest Series; Gv.59, 69.). The Gandhavamsa (61f, 71; also Svd.1212) mentions a tíká on the Kankhávitaraní named Vinayatthamañjúsá, written by Buddhanága at the request of Sumedha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Katáhaka Játaka (No.125)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when the Bodhisatta was a rich treasurer in Benares a son was born to him. A female slave in the house gave birth to a son on the same day. The boys grew up together, the slave's son being called Katáhaka. Katáhaka acquired various arts in the company of his master. When he grew up he was appointed as the Treasurer's private secretary. One day he visited a merchant on the frontier, carrying a letter purporting to be from the Treasurer (in which he was stated to be the son of the latter), asking for the hand of the merchant's daughter in marriage. The merchant was overjoyed, and the marriage took place. Katáhaka gave himself great airs and spoke contemptuously of everything &quot;provincial.&quot; The Treasurer, discovering what had happened, decided to visit the merchant, but Katáhaka went to meet him on the way, and paying him all the honour due from a slave, begged him not to expose him. Meanwhile, he had misled his wife's relations into the belief that the homage, paid by him to the Treasurer, was but the regard due from a son to his father. He was not like the sons of other parents, but knew what was due to his father. The Bodhisatta, being pleased, did not expose the slave, but on learning from Katáhaka's wife that Katáhaka always complained of his food, he taught her a stanza which contained the threat - not intelligible to her, though clear to Katáhaka - that if Katáhaka continued to make a nuisance of himself, the Treasurer would return and expose him. Thenceforth Katáhaka held his peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who used to boast of his high lineage and the wealth of his family until his pretensions were exposed (J.i.451ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.357ff), the story was told in reference to a monk named Tissa who would </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Katuviya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when the Buddha was going about for alms near the fig-tree at the cattle tethering in the neighbourhood of Isipatana, he saw a monk, whose delight was in the empty outer joys of sense, and admonished him, saying that flies will settle on and attack him who is corrupt and reeks with the stench of carrion. Hearing this, the monk was greatly stirred. Later the Buddha repeated the admonition to the assembled monks and explained that greed was corruption, malice the stench of carrion and evil ways of thought the flies. A.i.280f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kandina Játaka (No.13)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountain stag fell in love with a doe who had gone into the forest from the village during the time of the ripening of the corn. When the time came for the doe to return to the village, the stag, in his love, accompanied her. The people of the village, knowing of the deer's return, lay in ambush for them. The doe, seeing a huntsman, sent the stag on ahead, and he was killed and eaten. The doe escaped. The Bodhisatta, who was a forest-deva, seeing the incident, preached to the other forest-dwellers on the three infamies: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;it is infamy to cause another's death;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;infamous is the land ruled by a woman:  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;infamous are the men who yield   themselves to women's dominance (J.i.153-6).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circumstances in which the story was related are given in the Indriya Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kajangala (Kajangalá)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A township which formed the eastern boundary of the Majjhimadesa. Beyond it was Mahásálá (Vin.i.197; DA.i.173; MA.i.316, etc.; AA.i.55, etc.; J.i.49; Mbv.12). In the Buddha's time it was a prosperous place where provisions could easily be obtained (dabbasambhárasulabhá) (J.iv.310). Once when the Buddha was staying in the Veluvana at Kajangala, the lay followers there heard a sermon from the Buddha and went to the nun Kajangalá to have it explained in detail (A.v.54f). On another occasion the Buddha stayed in the Mukheluvana and was visited there by Uttara, the disciple of Párásariya. Their conversation is recorded in the Indriyabháváná Sutta (M.iii.298ff). In the Milindapañha (p.10), Kajangala is described as a brahmin village and is given as the place of Nágasena's birth. In the Kapota Játaka mention is made of Kajangala, and the scholiast (J.iii.226-7) explains that it may be the same as Benares. According to the scholiast of the Bhisa Játaka (J.iv.311), the tree-spirit mentioned in that story was the chief resident monk in an old monastery in Kajangala, which monastery he repaired with difficulty during the time of Kassapa Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kajangala is identified with the Kie-chu-hoh-khi-lo of Hiouen Thsang, which he describes as a district about two thousand li in circumference. (Beal, Bud. Records, ii.193, and n.; see also Cunningham, A.G.I.723). It may also be identical with the town Pundavardhana mentioned in the Divyávadána (p.21f). The Avadánasataka (ii.41) calls it Kacangalá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It is a variant of Kaccána. (J.vi.283, 286, 301, 327).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kátiyána.-The name of a gotta, probably a variant of Kaccáyana, Kaccána (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kátiyána Thera.-The son of a. brahmin of the Kosiya-gotta in Sávatthi, he was called Kátiyána after his mother's family. When his friend Sámaññakáni joined the Order, he followed his example and exerted himself in meditation, sleeping but little. One night, overcome by sleep, he fell on the terrace where he was pacing to and fro, and the Buddha, seeing him, went himself to help him and urged him not to give up his efforts but to concentrate and contemplate. Aided by this admonition, Kátiyána soon became an arahant. The Buddha's sermon is included in the Theragáthá (Thag.vv.411-16; ThagA.i.450f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the story of Sámaññakáni, given in the Theragáthá Commentary (i, p.99f), it would appear that Kátiyána was, for some time, a Paribbájaka. He was destitute, having, since the appearance of the Buddha, lost all his support from the laity. He therefore sought Sámaññakáni and asked his advice, which he followed by joining the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kátiyána.-See Pakudha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kálásoka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Susunága and king of Magadha for twenty-eight years. The tenth year of his reign completed one hundred years from the date of the Buddha's death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the reign of Kálásoka the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjiputtakaa')"&gt;Vajjian&lt;/a&gt; heresy appeared among the Sangha, and at first the king took the side of the Vajjians. Later, his sister Nandá persuaded him to transfer his patronage to the orthodox monks, and a convocation was held, with his support, at the Válikáráma in Vesáli, at which the Vajjians were proved in the wrong. (Mhv.iv.7, 8, 9, 31, 38, 39, 42, 63; Dpv.iv.44, 52; v.25, 80, 99; Sp i.33).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kálásoka had ten sons, who carried on the government after him for twenty-two years (Mhv.v.14). He and Pandukábhaya were contemporary kings for many years (Sp.i.72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The names of his ten sons were: Bhaddasena, Korandavanna, Mangura, Sabbañjaha, Jálika, Ubhaka, Sañjaya, Korabya, Nandivaddhana, and Pañcamaka. Mbv. p.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is great difference of opinion as to the identity of Kálásoka. Some hold that he is the same as Kákavanna of the Puránas and Udáyin of the Jaina traditions, and that these names are merely other appellations of Udayabhadda of the Pali sources. Kálásoka is credited with having removed the capital of Magadha from Rájagaha to Pátaliputta. The whole question of Kálásoka is discussed by Geiger in his Introd. to the Mhv.Trs.xliii.f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Sankantikas were an offshoot of the Kassapiyá (Mhv.v.9; Dpv.v.48; Mbv.96). The Kathávatthu Commentary (Points of Controversy, p.101) states that the Kassapiyá held that the past survives, as presently existing, in part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Dummukha was once its king (J.iii.379; J.ii.214; also Mtu.i.283).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes (E.g.,J.iii.79; iv.396; v.21; vi.391; 464) Kampilla is spoken of as being a kingdom, of which Uttarapañcala was a city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Alínasatta is spoken of as Kampilla because he was the king of the city of the same name.

The reference is probably to the Kaccána Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaccána Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A discourse to the monks by Mahá Kaccána on the six topics of recollection - the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, one's own virtues, generosity and the devas (A.iii.314ff). It is quoted in the Visuddhi-magga (p.519), where it is stated that to speak of casual happenings as a mere arising is to contradict both the Padesa-vihára Sutta and the Kaccána Sutta.

Thither came a man, saved from a wreck, without any clothes, who set up as a naked ascetic and became known by the name of Karambiya (v.l. Karamhiya). Among his followers was a Nága-king, Pandara, and also a Garuda-king. At the latter's request, he persuaded Pandara to tell him how the Nágas escaped destruction by the Garudas, and later he divulged the secret to the Garuda-king. The ascetic's treachery was discovered, and when he swore his innocence his head split in seven and he was dragged to Avíci. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is given in the Pandara Játaka (J.v.75ff), and is referred to in the Milindapañha (p.201).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the Andhakavenhudásaputtá found themselves unable to capture Dváravatí, because the city rose into the air when attacked, they sought the ascetic's help. He told them that an ass wandered round the city and brayed at the sight of an enemy, when the city immediately rose up into the sky. The Andhakavenhus sought the ass and begged for his help. Acting on the ass's advice, they tied eight great iron posts to the gates, thus preventing the city from rising. In this way they captured it (J.iv.83).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, their sons, wishing to test Kanhadipányana's powers of clairvoyance, played a practical joke on him. They tied a pillow to the belly of a young lad, and dressing him up as a woman, took him to the ascetic and asked when the baby would be born. The ascetic replied that on the seventh day the person before him would give birth to a knot of acacia wood which would destroy the race of Vásudeva. The youths thereupon fell on him and killed him, but his prophecy came true (J.iv.87). This ascetic is evidently not the one mentioned in the Játaka bearing his name, for there he is identified with the Bodhisatta, while in the story given above the Bodhisatta was the ascetic's contemporary and was called Ghatapandita (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immolation of Kanhadípáyana and its consequences are often referred to. E.g., J.v.114; 267, 273.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kanhadípáyana.-An ascetic; his story is given in the Kanhadípáyana Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Before she was born, Brahmadatta, king of Benares, killed her father and carried off her mother. When the child was born, Brahmadatta adopted her as his own daughter; she is, therefore, called dvepitiká (=having two fathers). The king promised to grant her a boon, and she held a svayamvara, at which she chose as her husbands all the five sons of King Pandu; Ajjuna, Bhíma, Nakula, Yuddhitthila, and Sahadeva. According to the Mahábhárata, Draupadí, daughter of the Pañcála king, was the wife of these five princes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By her strong passions she won the love of them all. Not satisfied with them, she also made love to a hump-backed slave who was in her service. One day, when she was sick, all her husbands were gathered round her, and she made signs to each of them to show that she loved him best. Ajjuna, however, was suspicious, and by questioning the hump-back, learnt the truth. The five brothers left her and retired to the Himalaya, where they became ascetics. The story was related by Kunála, who is identified with Ajjuna. J.v.424, 426f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kanhá.-See Kanhájiná.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Here Irandatí sang her song, hearing which Punnaka, on his way to a meeting of the yakkhas, plighted his troth to her. After Punnaka had won Vidhura, he took him to Kálapabbata, and there tried by various means to kill him. His attempts failed, and Vidhura, learning the motive for his act, preached to him, seated on the top of the mountain, and converted him (J.vi.255, 264, 302ff, 309, 326). In some places the mountain is called Kálagiri. E.g., ibid., 302, 304, 309, 326; see also Mtu.ii.300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Near the city was the Lumbinívana (q.v.) where the Buddha was born, and which became one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists. Close to Kapilavatthu flowed the river Rohiní, which formed the boundary between the kingdoms of the Sákyans and the Koliyans (DhA.iii.254). In the sixth century B.C. Kapilavatthu was the centre of a republic, at the head of which was Suddhodana. The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santhágárasálá (D.i.91; J.iv.145). It was here that Vidúdabha was received by the Sákyans (J.iv.146f). The walls of the city were eighteen cubits high (J.i.63; according to Mtu.ii.75 it had seven walls). From Kapilavatthu to the river Anomá, along the road taken by Gotama, when he left his home, was a distance of thirty yojanas (J.i.64). The city was sixty leagues from Rájagaha, and the Buddha took two months covering this distance when he visited his ancestral home, in the first year after his Enlightenment. On this journey the Buddha was accompanied by twenty thousand monks, and Káludáyí went on ahead as harbinger. The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodháráma near the city and, in the midst of his kinsmen, as he did at the foot of the Gandamba, the Buddha performed the Yamakapátiháriya to convince them of his powers. (J.i.87ff; this journey to Kapilavatthu was one of the scenes depicted in the relic-chamber of the Mahá-Thúpa, Mhv.xxx.81).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this occasion he preached the Vessantara Játaka. The next day the Buddha went begging in the city to the great </data>
<data>horror of his father, who, on being explained that such was the custom of all Buddhas, became a sotápanna and invited the Buddha and his monks to the palace. After the meal the Buddha preached to the women of the palace who, with the exception of Ráhulamátá, had all come to hear him. At the end of the sermon, Suddhodana became a sakadágámí and Mahá-Pajápatí a sotápanna. The Buddha visited Ráhulamátá in her dwelling and preached to her the Candakinnara Játaka. The next day Nanda was ordained, and seven days later Ráhula (also Vin.i.82). As a result of the latter's ordination, a rule was passed by the Buddha, at Suddhodana's request, that no one should be ordained without the sanction of his parents, if they were alive. On the eighth day was preached the Mahádhammapála Játaka, and the king became an anágámí. The Buddha returned soon after to Rájagaha, stopping on the way at Anupiyá, where the conversions of Ananda, Devadatta, Bhagu, Anuruddha, and Kimbila took place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the visit to Kapilavatthu, eighty thousand Sákyans from eighty thousand families had joined the Buddhist Order (Vin.ii.180; DhA.i.112; iv.124, etc.). According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.4; Bu. p.5f), it was during this visit that, at the request of Sáriputta, the Buddha preached the Buddhavamsa. It is not possible to ascertain how many visits in all were paid by the Buddha to his native city, but it may be gathered from various references that he went there several times; two visits, in addition to the first already mentioned, were considered particularly memorable. On one of these he arrived in Kapilavatthu to prevent the Sákyans and the Koliyans, both his kinsmen, from fighting each other over the question of their sharing the water of the Rohiní; he appeared before them as they were preparing to slay each other, and convinced them of the futility of their wrath. On this </data>
<data>occasion were preached the following Játakas: the Phandana, the Daddabha, the Latukika, the Rukkhadhamma, and the Vattaka - also the Attadanda Sutta. Delighted by the intervention of the Buddha, the two tribes each gave him two hundred and fifty youths to enter his Order and, with these, he went on his alms rounds alternately to Kapilavatthu and to the capital of the Koliyans (J.v.412ff; the Sammodamána Játaka also seems to have been preached in reference to this quarrel, J.i.208). On this occasion he seems to have resided, not at the Nigrodháráma, but in the Mahávana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second visit of note was that paid by the Buddha when Vidúdabha (q.v), chagrined by the insult of the Sákyans, invaded Kapilavatthu in order to take his revenge. Three times Vidúdabha came with his forces, and three times he found the Buddha seated on the outskirts of Kapilavatthu, under a tree which gave him scarcely any shade; near by was a shady banyan-tree, in Vidúdabha's realm; on being invited by Vidúdabha to partake of its shade, the Buddha replied, &quot;Let be, O king; the shade of my kindred keeps me cool.&quot; Thus three times Vidúdabha had to retire, his purpose unaccomplished; but the fourth time the Buddha, seeing the fate of the Sákyans, did not interfere (J.iv.152).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu. On one such visit he preached the Kanha Játaka (J.iv.6ff). Various Sákyans went to see him both at the Nigrodháráma and at the Mahávana, among them being Mahánáma (S.v.369f; A.iii.284f; iv.220f; v.320f), Nandiya (S.v.403f; 397f; A.v.334f), Vappa (A.ii.196; M.i.91), and perhaps Sárakáni (S.v.372).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sákyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked </data>
<data>Moggallána to carry on while he slept. We are told that the Sákyans decorated the town with lights for a yojana round, and stopped all noise while the Buddha was in the mote-hall (MA.ii.575). On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta (M.i.353ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books record a visit paid by the Brahmá Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahávana at Kapilavatthu. (This appears, from the context, to have been quite close to the Nigrodháráma.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodháráma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life (S.iii.91f; Ud.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mahánáma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharandu, the Káláman (A.i.276f). On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness (A.i.219).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all the Sákyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman's great powers, even after the Buddha's performance of various miracles. We find, for instance, Dandapání meeting the Buddha in the Mahávana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha's explanations, Dandapání shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles (M.i.108f.; this was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupindika Sutta). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Others were more convinced and patronised the Order - e.g., Kála-Khemaka and Ghatáya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodháráma (M.iii.109. As a result of noticing these cells, the Buddha preached the Mahasuññáta Sutta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the Buddha ordained ten thousand householders of Kapilavatthu with the &quot;ehi-bhikkhu-pabbajá.&quot; (Sp.i.241)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahánáma (q.v.) was the Buddha's most frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cúladukkhakkhandha Sutta (M.i.91f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dakkhiná-vibhanga Sutta was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahá-Pajápatí-Gotamí. Apart from those already mentioned, another Sákyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Káligodhá by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha's father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha (S.v.396).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kapilavatthavá (E.g., S.iv.182).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Vesálí (Vin.ii.253), and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bávarí's disciples from Alaka to Sávatthi (Sn.p.194).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Mahávana, outside Kapilavatthu, the forest extended up to the Himalaya, and on the other side of the city it reached as far as the sea (MA.i.449, UdA.184; Sp.ii.393).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is significant that, in spite of the accounts given of the greatness of Kapilavatthu, it was not mentioned by Ananda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusinárá (D.ii.146). After the Buddha's death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the Sákyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.2). Here was deposited the rug (paccattharana) used by the Buddha (Bu.xxviii.8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the northern books the city was </data>
<data>called Kapilavastu, Kapilapura, and Kapilávhayapura (E.g. Lal. p.243, 28; The Buddha-carita, I.v.2 calls it Kapilasyavastu). According to the Dulva (Rockhill, p.11), the city was on the banks of the Bhagírathí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identification of Kapilavatthu is not yet beyond the realm of conjecture. Hiouen Thsang (Beal ii.,p.13f) visited the city and found it like a wilderness. The Asoka inscriptions of the Lumbiní pillar and the Niglíva pillar are helpful in determining the site. Some identify the modern village of Pipráwá - famous for the vases found there - with Kapilavatthu (E.g., Fleet, J.R.A.S.1906, p.180; CAGI.711f). Others, including Rhys Davids, say there were two cities, one ancient and the other modern, founded after Vidúdabha's conquest, and the ancient one they call Tilaura Kot. But the theory of two Kapilavatthu is rejected by some scholars. J.R.A.S.1906, pp.453, 563. See also the article by Mukherji on Kapilavastu in ERE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It consists of a dialogue between the Buddha and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/acela_kassapa')"&gt;Acela-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; on self-mortification, and contains an account of some of the practices prevalent among the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aajiivakaa')"&gt;Ájívakas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha claims that the insight and self-control and self-mastery of the arahant are much harder of attainment than the merely physical practices of the ascetics, which are far more evident to the vulgar. The Buddha states that self-mortification is an actual hindrance to spiritual development, for it turns a man's mind from more essential matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that at the conclusion of the Sutta, Kassapa entered the Order and, in due course, became an arahant.

He is mentioned as staying in Kosambí, in Ghosita Park, and as asking Ananda certain questions, recorded in the Kámabhú Sutta (1) (S.iv.165). Two other suttas bearing the same name record visits paid to Kámabhú by Cittagahapati at Ambátakavana in Macchikásanda. S.iv.291, 293.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

(Cv.lxx.143) Later he seems to have been appointed general by Parakkamabáhu himself and given the title of Lankápura, for we find him fighting on the side of the king and being entrusted with important campaigns.

When the Buddha arrived at Nádiká on his last journey, Ananda asked him what had happened to Kakudha, who was already dead. The Buddha replied that Kakudha had found birth in the highest heavens, there to pass away entirely (D.ii.92).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kakudha.-A deva. He visited the Buddha at the Añjanavana in Sáketa, and asked him whether he experienced feelings of pleasure and sorrow. The Buddha replied that he had overcome such feelings and was utterly free, whereupon Kakudha uttered his praises (S.i.54f). The Commentary (SA.i.89) says that this Kakudha was a Brahma and that he was an attendant of Moggallána, thus identifying him with Kakudha (3 below). He lived with the thera in his youth, died in a Jhána-trance and was reborn in the Brahma-world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kakudha.-Probably identical with Kakudha (2). He was an inhabitant of Koliya and was an attendant of Moggallána. Having died, he was reborn among the mind-born (Manomaya) devas and his form was so great that it was as extensive as &quot;two of three common rice-fields in a Magadha village, and yet so constituted that he was in the way neither of himself nor of others.&quot; Becoming aware of Devadatta's plans for obtaining possession of the leadership of the Sangha, Kakudha reported the news to Moggallána, who passed it on to the Buddha. The Buddha asked Moggallána to keep the matter secret. Moggallána informed the Buddha that he knew from experience that Kakudha's predictions proved true (Vin.ii.185f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kakudha.-A Pacceka Buddha of thirty-one kappas ago, to whom Uddáladáyaka Thera, in a previous birth, gave a flower. Ap.i.225.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Kakudha.-A bird in the time of Padumuttara Buddha and a previous birth of Malitavambha Thera. The bird gave the Buddha a lotus. v.l. Kukkuttha. ThagA.i.211; Ap.i.180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Kakudha Kaccána.-See Pakudha Kaccána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Kakudha.-A little pond in Mahámeghavana between the site of the Mahá-Thúpa and the Thúpáráma. The Mahá-Thúpa was at the upper end of the pond, and the spot had been consecrated by the visit of the four Buddhas of the present kappa (Mhv.xv.53ff). Lañjatissa appears to have filled up the pond at great expense, the land around having become waterlogged (Mhv.xxxiii.23f; MT.611). The bund (páli) of the pond formed part of the Símá at Anurádhapura. Mbv.135f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kamsa.&lt;/b&gt;-Another name, according to the scholiast, for Brahmadatta, king of Benares and father of Samuddajá. J.vi.198 (25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kamsa.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Benares, and called Báránasiggaha because he was ruler of Benares. According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/seyya_jat_282')"&gt;Seyya Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.403), he was the king who was seized by the monarch of Kosala, owing to the treachery of a disloyal courtier, and who was later set free on account of his great piety. In the Ekarája Játaka, which purports to relate the same story, and again in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasilava_jat_051')"&gt;Mahásílava Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, the king is referred to by other names. We probably have here a confusion of legends due to an effort to make three similar stories into one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is probably this same Kamsa Báránasiggaha who is referred to in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tesakuna_jat_521')"&gt;Tesakuna Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, by the owl Vessantara (J.v.112). There the scholiast explains Báránasiggaha as catúhi sangahavatthúhi Báránasim gahetvá vattanto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kamsa.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Mahákamsa and brother of Upakamsa and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devagabbhaa')"&gt;Devagabbhá&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he became king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asitanjana')"&gt;Asitañjana&lt;/a&gt; in Kamsabhoga in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttaraapatha')"&gt;Uttarápatha&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was killed by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasudeva')"&gt;Vasudeva&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa')"&gt;Andhakavenhudá-saputtá&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.79f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On the fast-day of the dark fortnight a Yakkha named Naradeva took possession of him and he barked like a mad dog. His son, knowing this, shut him up indoors on these occasions. When the king discovered this, Kávinda was cast into prison and ordered to be flogged for plotting against Mahosadha, but at the latter's request he was pardoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present age he was Ambattha (J.vi.478).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Karerimandalamálá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pavilion near the Karerikutiká, evidently a hall with a thatched roof supported by wooden pillars, but with no walls (D.ii.1; Dial.ii.5, n.2). Buddhaghosa calls it a nisídanasálá (sitting-hall). Between this hall and the Gandhakuti was the Karerimandapa. Probably the term Karerimandalamálá was used to denote all the grounds within the Gandhakuti, the Karerikutiká and this hall (Gandhakuti pi Karerikutiká pi sálá pi Karerimandalamálo ti vuccati) (DA.ii.407). Dhammapála, however, says that only the mandapa and the sálá were called Karerimandalamálá. He explains mandalamálá thus: tinapannacchadanam anovassakam mandalamálo; atimuttakádi latámandapo ti apare (UdA.203). The monks seem to have been in the habit of sitting out here and talking on various topics at the close of the day. One such topic is recorded in the Udána (Ud., p.30f), for discussing which the monks drew on themselves the Buddha's stern rebuke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

J.vi.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kálavela.-A servant of Díghagámani.. He refused to promise the brothers of Ummádacittá that he would kill her if she gave birth to a boy, and so he was killed by them and reborn as a yakkha (Mhv.ix.22f). Later he saved the life of this boy, Pandukábhaya, who was being carried in a basket (Mhv.x.4), and when Pandukábhaya came to the throne, he founded a settlement for Káladeva to the east of Anurádhapura (Mhv.vs.84). It is said that on feast days the yakkha appeared in visible form in company with Pandukábhaya (Mhv.vs104). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahásena afterwards built a thúpa on the site of Kálavela's shrine.

Kapota Játaka (No.42).-Once the Bodhisatta was born as a pigeon and lived in a straw basket hung in the kitchen of the setthi of Benares. A crow, sniffing the savour of the food being cooked in the kitchen and longing to taste it, struck up a friendship with the pigeon in order to gain admission. In the evening, having searched for his food in the pigeon's company, he accompanied him home, and the setthi's cook, on seeing him, provided a basket for him. One day, seeing some fish being prepared, the crow feigned illness and stayed behind in his basket, in spite of the warnings of the pigeon, who suspected his real reason. The cook caught the crow stealing a piece of fish and, in order to punish him, plucked his feathers and soused him in a pickle of ginger and salt and cumin mixed with sour butter-milk. The pigeon, on his return, found him in this state and, having learnt his story, flew away, not wishing to live there any more. The crow died and was flung on the dust heap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a greedy monk who was identified with the crow. J.i.241ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kapota Játaka (No.375).-The same as above, except for a few details. When the theft was discovered, the cook made a mixture of moist ginger and white mustard, pounded with a rotten date, and after wounding the crow with a potsherd, rubbed the stuff into the wound and fastened the potsherd round its neck.

Savittha prefers the one released by faith, Mahá-Kotthita the one who has testified to the truth with body, while Sáriputta's preference is for the one who has won view, for in him insight is most developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they go to the Buddha and put the case before him; the Buddha tells them that it is not an easy matter to decide.

The Buddha's discourse on this occasion is referred to by Ananda in a conversation with Channa (S.iii.134).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kasmíra&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A district in Northern India, the modern Kashmir. In the Pali texts it is always mentioned with Gandhára and probably once formed part of that kingdom. (See also PHAI., p.93. The Játakas mention the countries separately as comprising two kingdoms ruled by a single king, e.g., J.iii.364, 378). At the end of the Third Council, Moggaliputta sent the thera Majjhantika to propagate the religion in Kasmíra-Gandhára. Majjhantika quelled the power of the Nága-king Aravála (q.v.), who was a menace to the inhabitants, and converted him to the faith, while the yakkha Pandaka and his wife Háritá, with their five hundred sons, became sotápannas. The thera preached the Ásívisúpama Sutta to the assembled multitude and won eighty thousand converts, while one hundred thousand persons entered the Order. We are told that from that time onwards the yellow robe was held in great esteem in Kasmíra. (Mhv.xii.3,&lt;st1:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="9 ff"&gt;9 ff&lt;/st1:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;; Dpv.viii.4; Sp.i.64ff; see also Beal, op. cit., i.134, n.39). There was evidently a large community of monks at Kasmíra, till long after the coming of Majjhantika, for we are told that two hundred and eighty thousand monks, led by Uttinna, came from Kasmíra to Anurádhapura on the occasion of the foundation ceremony of the Mahá Thupa (Mhv.xxix.37).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hiouien Thsang's time Kasmíra seems to have been an independent kingdom whose king was given to serpent-worship while his queen was a follower of the Buddha. Near the capital was a stúpa which enshrined a tooth of the Buddha. This tooth was soon after taken away by Harsavardhana of Kanoj. (CAGI.104ff; Beal, i.116f, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ságala is mentioned as being twelve leagues from Kasmíra (Mil.82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Káludáyí Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of one of Suddhodana's ministers at Kapilavatthu; he was born on the same day as the Buddha and grew up as his playfellow. After Gotama left the world, Suddhodana made Káludáyí one of his most trusted counsellors. When the king heard of his son's Enlightenment he sent several of his ministers with large retinues to bring the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, but they all became arahants as soon as they heard the Buddha's preaching and then forgot their mission. In the end the king sent Káludáyí, on the understanding that he should first be allowed to join the Order. (According to Mtu.iii.233, he was accompanied by Channa in this mission). He went to the Buddha and, having listened to him, himself became an arahant. When the rains fell, covering the earth with the glory of leaves and flowers, Káludáyí felt that it was time for the Buddha to visit his kinsmen, and gave him their invitation, singing the season's beauties in a series of verses. The Buddha took sixty days in covering the sixty leagues from Rájagaha to Kapilavatthu, and each day Káludáyí went by air to the king's palace to tell him of the progress made in the journey and to bring back to the Buddha from the palace a bowl full of excellent food. By the time the Buddha reached his home his kinsmen were already full of faith in him. Because Káludáyí accomplished this feat, he was declared pre-eminent among those who gladdened the clans (kulappasádakánam aggo) (A.i.25; Thag.527-36; J.i.54, 86f; AA.i.107, 117; ThagA.i.497ff; UdA.168; DA.ii.425).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that he was called Udáyí because he was born on a day on which the citizens were full of joy (udaggacittadivase játattá); and called Kála because of his slightly dark colour. AA.i.167; ThagA.i.498.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Apadána (ii.500f; see </data>
<data>also Ap.i.86f, where another set of verses is attributed to Káludáyí), Káludáyí had been the son of a minister of Hamsavatí during the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and having heard the Buddha utter the praises of a monk skilled in converting families, had wished for the same eminence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikáya (A.iv.449f) records a conversation between Udáyí (who, according to Buddhaghosa (AA.ii.815), is to be identified with Káludáyí) and Ananda. Udáyí asks Ananda to explain in detail a question which is recorded in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.48) as having been asked of the Buddha by Pañcálacanda-devaputta (see Pañcála Sutta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (iv.143) refers to an assembly at which Káludáyí was present, his body of golden hue, sitting near Pasenadi, at sunset, with the moon rising in the eastern sky. Ananda looks at them and declares how the Buddha suffuses them all with his glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Káludáyí is identified with Sakka in the Bhisa Játaka (J.iv.314).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

During the rains the three came down to the haunts of men and at the end of the rainy season returned to the hermitage. The Bodhisatta went on ahead to prepare the hermitage, leaving the father and the younger brother to follow. The lad, finding the father's progress very slow, tried to hurry him, much to the latter's annoyance. The two quarrelled, and thus were so late that the Bodhisatta came to look for them. On hearing what had happened, he told the father, who is called Kassapa, that the old should have patience with the young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a nobleman of Sávatthi, who became a monk and who, on his mother's death, was joined by his father and younger brother. All three went to a village retreat to fetch robes, and things happened as in the past. As a result, it was not till the next day that they could pay their respects to the Buddha, who, hearing what had occurred, related the Játaka. J.iii.36-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha accepted and was waited on with great devotion. As a result the layman was born in Távatimsa, in a palace which came to be called Karaníyavimána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further story is told similar to the above, except that the person fed is a monk and not the Buddha (Vv.55; VvA.248f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the monastery once lived a sámanera, possessed of great iddhi powers, who, not heeding the advice of his teacher, fell in love with a weaver's daughter and, as a result, lost all his powers. Later, the woman lost her sight through a blow from him, and he was reduced to abject poverty. The sámanera's teacher had warned him of just this, but the warning was of no avail (VibhA.294f.; but see MA.ii.699f., where the names are spelt differently). v.l.

As a result, she was thirty-six times chief queen of the king of heaven and wife of fifty kings of men (Ap.ii.516f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is evidently to be identified with Abhayamátá.

In the cemetery the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chabbaggiyaa')"&gt;Chabbaggiya&lt;/a&gt;-nuns buried the ashes of one of their leaders and erected a thúpa near Kappitaka's cell. The Elder, disturbed by the sound of their lamentations, broke the thúpa and scattered the materials. The nuns, greatly angered, plotted to kill him, but he was warned by Upáli, and lay hidden elsewhere until the nuns had destroyed his cell and gone away under the impression that he was dead. The nuns blamed Upáli for upsetting their arrangements (Vin.iv.308).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Peta-vatthu and its Commentary (Pv.50; PvA.229ff), Kappitaka lived in &lt;a href="kapinacanaa')"&gt;Kapinaccána&lt;/a&gt; (near Vesáli), and there the Licchavi &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambasakkhara')"&gt;Ambasakkhara&lt;/a&gt; offered him alms on behalf of a peta.

After she married she visited her mother, and one day, while she was there, her husband sent for her. Her mother, not wishing her to return empty-handed, asked her to wait till she had made some cakes. When the cakes were ready, a monk came to the door and Káná gave him some. Four other monks came, and the cakes were finished. Four times Káná's husband sent for her and four times the same thing happened. So, in anger, the husband took another wife. Káná, learning this, was so greatly annoyed that she reviled and abused every monk she saw until no monk dared go into her street. The Buddha, hearing of this, visited Káná's mother, and having finished his meal there, sent for Káná, argued with her, and convinced her that the monks were not to blame inasmuch as they had only taken what was given them. At the end of the Buddha's discourse Káná became a sotápanna. The king saw the Buddha returning from Káná's home and, on learning what had happened, sent for her, adopted her as his daughter, and arranged for her marriage with a rich nobleman. Thenceforward Káná's generosity to the monks became proverbial. Vin.iv.78f; DhA.ii.149ff; the Samantapásádiká (iv.819) gives a somewhat different account; there, when Káná's husband heard that the Buddha had been to see her, he sent for her and she returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on Káná's account that the Babbu Játaka (q.v.) (J.i.477f) was preached. Káná is identified with the mouse of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was called Káná because she was so beautiful that those who saw her became blind with passion for her (ye ye tam passanti, te te rágena káná honti) (Sp. loc. cit.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Káná and her mother are mentioned among those who kept the eightfold fast.

Katthaváhana had been a very clever carpenter of Benares, having under him sixteen thousand and sixteen assistants. They paid periodical visits to the Himalaya forests, felled trees, and having prepared the timber which was suitable for building purposes, brought it down the Ganges and erected houses for the king and for the people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing tired of this work, these carpenters made flying machines of light wood, and going northwards from Benares to Himavá, established by conquest a kingdom, the chief carpenter becoming the king. He came to be called Katthaváhana, the capital was named Katthaváhananagara and the country Katthaváhanarattha. The king was righteous and the people very happy and the country prospered greatly. Later Katthaváhana and the king of Benares became sincere friends, and free trade, exempt from all taxes, was established between the two countries. The kings sent each other very costly and magnificent gifts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Katthaváhana sent to the king of Benares eight priceless rugs in eight caskets of lacquered ivory, each rug being sixteen cubits long and eight cubits wide and of unsurpassed splendour. The Benares king, wondering how he could adequately return the courtesy, decided to let his friend learn the great news of the appearance in the world of the Buddha (Kassapa), the Dhamma and the Sangha. This message was written on a gold leaf and the leaf enclosed in many caskets, one inside the other, the innermost casket being made of the seven kinds of jewels and the outermost of costly wood. The caskets were placed on a splendid palanquin and sent on the back of a royal elephant, accompanied by all the insignia of royalty. All along the route the </data>
<data>honours due to a king were paid to the casket, and Katthaváhana himself escorted the elephant from the frontiers of his kingdom to the capital. When Katthaváhana discovered the message, he was overjoyed, and sent his nephew with sixteen of his ministers and sixteen thousand followers to investigate the matter and convey his greetings to the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The envoys arrived at Benares only after the Buddha's death, but hearing from the Buddha's disciples of the Doctrine he had proclaimed to the world, the ministers and their followers entered the Order, while Katthaváhana's nephew was sent back to report the news to the king, taking with him the Buddha's water-pot, a branch of the Bodhi tree and a monk versed in the Doctrine. The king, having learnt the Doctrine, engaged in various works of piety till his death, after which he was born among the Kámávacara devas. SnA.ii.675ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Katthaváhana.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Benares. He was the Bodhisatta, son of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, and of a faggot-gatherer, whom the king met in a grove, singing as she picked up the sticks. His story is related in the Katthahári Játaka. J.i.133ff; DhA.i.349; J.iv.148.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Katthaváhana.&lt;/b&gt;-A king. He had been a master builder and built for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhi')"&gt;Bodhirájakumára&lt;/a&gt;, a palace called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokanada')"&gt;Kokanadá&lt;/a&gt;, unrivalled in its splendour. In order to prevent the building of a similar palace for anyone else, the prince decided to make away with the master builder at the conclusion of his work, and confided his plan to his friend &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjikaputta')"&gt;Sañjikáputta&lt;/a&gt;. The latter, being most distressed at this suggestion of wanton cruelty, warned the builder who, procuring seasoned timber with sap well dried, under pretence </data>
<data>that it was needed for the palace, shut himself up and fashioned a wooden Garuda-bird, large enough to hold himself and his family. When his preparations were complete, the builder with his family mounted the bird and rode away through the air to the Himalaya, where he founded a kingdom and became known as King Katthaváhana (DhA.iii.135f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the building of the palace is mentioned in the introduction to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhonasaakha_jat_353')"&gt;Dhonasákha Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.157), but there we are told that the prince put out the builder's eyes, and no mention is made of the wooden bird and the subsequent story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kapi Játaka (No.250).-Once when the Bodhisatta was living the ascetic life in the Himalaya, his wife having died, a monkey came in the rainy weather to the hermitage clad in an anchorite's robe which he had found in the forest. The Bodhisatta recognised the monkey and drove him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a hypocritical brother. J.ii.268ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kapi Játaka (No.404).-Once the Bodhisatta and Devadatta were both born as monkeys. One day a mischievous monkey took his seat on the arch which was over the gateway to the park and, when the king's chaplain passed under the arch, he let excrement fall on his head, and, on the chaplain looking up, even into his mouth. The chaplain swore vengeance on the monkeys, and the Bodhisatta, hearing of it, counseled them to seek residence elsewhere. His advice was followed by all except the monkey, who was Devadatta, and a few of his followers. Sometime after, the king's elephants were burnt through a fire breaking out in their stalls. A goat had eaten some rice put out to dry and was beaten with a torch; his hair caught fire and the fire spread to the stalls. The chaplain, seizing his opportunity, told the elephant-doctors that the best remedy for burns was monkey-fat, and five hundred monkeys in the royal gardens were slain by archers for the sake of their fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta being swallowed up by the earth.

The wife plotted to estrange mother and son, and the old woman had to leave the house. The wife, having given birth to a son, went about saying that if the mother-in-law had been with her such a blessing would have been impossible. When the old woman heard of this, she felt that such things could only be said because Right (Dhamma) was dead and, going into the cemetery, she started to perform a sacrifice in memory of the dead Right. Sakka's throne becoming heated, he came down and, hearing her story, reconciled the old woman with her son and daughter-in-law by means of his great power. In the stanza spoken by Sakka, the old woman is addressed as Kaccáni and Kátiyání. The scholiast explains that she belonged to the Kaccánagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a young man of Sávatthi who looked after his aged mother till his wife came; then the wife undertook to tend her and for some time did her duties well. Later, she grew jealous of her husband's love for his mother, and contrived by various means to make the son angry with the old woman. Finally, she asked her husband to choose between herself and his mother. The young man, without hesitation, stood up for his mother, and the wife, realising her folly, mended her ways.

As long as the Licchavis sleep on straw (kalingara) so long will they be able to protect themselves from their enemy, Ajátasattu; when they begin to sleep on soft couches they will suffer defeat. Thus it is also with monks and Mára. S.ii.267f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kantakívana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A grove near Sáketa. The conversation which took place there between Sáriputta and Moggallána is recorded in the Padesa Sutta (S.v.174f). A discussion which took place there on another occasion between these two and Anuruddha, is given in the Kantakí Sutta (S.v.298f). The grove was evidently also called Tikantakí and the Commentary describes it as mahá-karamadda-vana, karamadda being a shrub (carissa carandas). The Buddha also stayed in this grove, and a sermon preached by him to the monks is recorded in the Tikantakí Sutta (A.v.169).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kakudha Sutta.-Records the visit of the deva Kakudha Koliyaputta to Moggallána, bringing him news of Devadatta's intention to destroy the Order. The sutta also contains a description of the five kinds of teachers who are impure in their conduct, their mode of livelihood, their preaching of the Dhamma, their system of exposition and their insight, and who yet are protected by their disciples because of love of gain. A.iii.122ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kakudha Sutta.-Records the visit of the devaputta Kakudha to the Buddha at the Añjanavana in Sáketa. See Kakudha (2). According to Tibetan sources (e.g. Rockhill, p.89), Kakudha was the son of Kaundinya (Kondañña). Which Kondañña is referred to here it is impossible to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kamboja (Kambojaka)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sixteen Mahájanapadas which, with Gandhára, belonged, not to the Majjhimadesa but, evidently, to the Uttarápatha (A.i.213; iv.252, 256, 260). It is often mentioned as the famous birthplace of horses (assánam áyatanam) (E.g., DA.i.124; AA.i.399; Vsm.332; also J.iv.464). In the Kunála Játaka (J.v.445) we are told that the Kambojas caught their horses by means of moss (jalajáta), and the scholiast (J.v.446) explains at length how this was done. They sprinkled the moss with honey and left it in the horses' drinking place; from there, by means of honey sprinkled on the grass, the horses were led to an enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Assaláyana Sutta (M.ii.149) it is stated that in Yona and in Kamboja, and also in the neighbouring countries, there were, in the Buddha's time, only two classes of people, masters and slaves, and that a master could become a slave or vice versa. The Commentary (MA.ii.784) explains that a brahmin would go there with his wife for purposes of trade and would die there. His wife would then be compelled to work for her living and her children would become slaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játakas (E.g., J.vi.208, 210; see also Manu.x.44) would lead us to believe that the people of Kamboja had lost their original customs and had become barbarous. Elsewhere' Kamboja is mentioned as a place not visited by women of other countries. A.ii.82; on the reading of this passage, however, see GS.ii.92, n.2. The Commentary (AA.ii.523) distinctly supports the reading Kamboja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country was evidently on one of the great caravan routes, and there was a road direct from Dváraka to Kamboja (Pv.p.23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Asoka's Rock Edict, No. </data>
<data>XIII. (Shábházgarhi Text), Kamboja was among the countries visited by Asoka's missionaries. The country referred to is probably on the banks of the Kabul river (Mookerji: Asoka, 168, n.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later literature (E.g., Cv.lxxvi.21, 55) Kamboja is the name given to Western Siam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Káyaviratigáthá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beautiful Páli poem, of two hundred and seventy-four verses, on the subjection of sensuality, written in Ceylon, probably in the seventeenth century. A tika on the poem is ascribed to a monk of Pakudhanagara (Pegu). (Gv.65, 75; Bode, op. cit., 44, n.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is in two sections, the first describing the formation of the body, its foulness and its worthlessness, and the second dealing with the mind and the advantages of developing the same regardless of the body. There is a Sinhalese translation probably by the author himself. P.L.C.285.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One fast-day there was no meat to be had, and the man who supplied it tied the money round the chameleon's neck.

Jetthatissa III. gave the village of Ambilápika for the supply of food to the monks of Kassapagiri (Cv.xliv.98), and Kassapa III. showed this monastery his special favour (Cv.xlviii.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monastery probably formed part of what - in an inscription of Mahinda IV. found at Vessagiris – is called the &quot;Isuramenu-Bo-Upulvan-Kasubgiri-Vihára.&quot; It would appear that Kassapa I. founded a great monastic establishment out of the Vessagiri and Issarasamana Viháras and that this enlarged monastery was named after his two daughters Bodhi and Uppalavanná and also after Kassapa himself. This establishment was evidently referred to briefly as Kassapagiri. (Ep. Zey.i.31ff; i.216; and Cv.Trs.i.43, n.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Kacchapa giri (q.v.) found in the Mahávamsa Tika (p.652; see also 407, which has Kassapagiri) is apparently a wrong reading for Kassapagiri, in which case the identification is important, for here we have &quot;Issarasamanasankháte Kacchapagiriviháre.&quot; See also Kassapavihára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Káka Játaka (No.140, 146, 395)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Káka Játaka (No.140).-The Bodhisatta was once born as a crow. One day a crow dropped filth on the king's chaplain as he was returning from the bath arrayed in all his splendour. He thereupon conceived hatred against all crows. Soon after that a woman slave, watching some rice spread out in the sun to dry, was angered by a goat who, as soon as she fell asleep, started to eat the rice. In exasperation she fetched a torch and struck the goat's shaggy back, which caught fire. To ease its pain, the goat ran into the hayshed near the king's elephant-stalls and rolled in the hay. In the conflagration that ensued many of the elephants were badly burnt, and when the chaplain was consulted, remembering his anger against crows, he said that the cure for burns was crows' fat. Crows were accordingly being mercilessly slaughtered; the Bodhisatta, hearing of this sought the king and explained to him the chaplain's motive. Crows had no fat, he said, because their life is passed in ceaseless dread. The king, being greatly pleased with the Bodhisatta's act, granted immunity to all living beings, showing particular favour towards crows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circumstances which led to the recital of the story are described in the Bhaddasála Játaka (q.v.). The king in the story was Ananda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Káka Játaka (No.146).-Once a crow came with his mate to the seashore and ate freely of the remnants of a sacrifice which had been offered by men to the Nágas and drank freely of the strong drink which he found. Both crows became drunk, and, while trying to swim in the surf, the hen-crow was washed into the sea and eaten by a fish. Hearing the husband's lamentations, many crows gathered together and started to empty the ocean, </data>
<data>working away until ready to drop from weariness. Seeing their plight, the Bodhisatta, who was then a sea-sprite, caused a bogey to appear from the sea, frightening them away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a number of monks who had joined the Order in their old age. They went for alms to their former wives' and children's houses, and gathering together at the house of the wife of one of them (she being particularly beautiful), placed together what each had received and ate it with sauces and curries prepared by the beautiful wife. The woman died, and the aged monks, returning to the monastery, wept aloud for their benefactress, the giver of sauces. The matter was reported to the Buddha, who identified the crows of the past with the foolish monks (J.i.497-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.422), the name of the woman was Madhurapáciká.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Káka Játaka (No.395).-The Bodhisatta was once a pigeon and lived in a net basket in the kitchen of a Benares merchant. A greedy crow, becoming intimate with him, came to live there. The cook discovered the crow trying to steal some food, and, pulling out his feathers, sprinkled him with flour, hung a chowrie round his neck and flung him into the basket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story closely resembles those of the Kapota Játaka and the Lola Játaka (q.v.), and is related in reference to a greedy monk (J.iii.314-16; see also Cunningham: Bharhut Stúpa, xlv. Pl.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kapota Játaka (J.i.241) makes reference to a Kaka Játaka of the Navani-páta. There is no such story in the Ninth Book; perhaps it is a wrong reading for the Cakkaváka Játaka (No.434), where the story is also related with reference to a greedy monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He stopped on the way, while his men steamed peas and put them into troughs for the horses to eat. A monkey came down from a tree hard by, filled his mouth and hands with peas, went back to his tree and started eating. One pea fell down, and he, letting all the other peas fall, clambered down to seek for the lost one. The Bodhisatta, who was the king's counsellor, pointed out to the king how fools of little wit spend a pound to win a penny. On hearing this, the king went back to Benares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Pasenadi, who was going on a similar expedition during the rains, and on the way visited the Buddha at Jetavana. The king in the story is identified with Ananda. J.ii.74ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Vijayabáhu I, built rest-houses at the village for the use of pilgrims coming to Samantakúta (Cv.lx.66).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kadalí is to be identified with the modern Kehelgamuva (Cv.Trs.i.221, n.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the Kadalisenagáma, where Devappatirája built a bridge of one hundred staves, may be the same village, but this is questionable (Cv.lxxxvi.41).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kaccáyana-vyákarana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A treatise on Páli grammar by Kaccáyana. The treatise is in eight divisions, each division comprising suttas or rules, expressed with great brevity; vutti or supplements, to render the suttas intelligible; payoga or grammatical analyses, with examples, and nyása or scholia, explanatory notes of the principal grammatical forms in the shape of questions and answers. The nyása often exists as a separate book, called the Mukhamattadípaní. Orthodox tradition ascribes the whole work to Mahá Kaccána, but another tradition, recorded in the Kaccáyanabheda, states that the aphorisms are by Kaccáyana, the vutti by Sanghánandí, the illustrations by Brahmadatta and the nyása by Vimalabuddhi - all perhaps belonging to the same school of Avanti (see above, Kaccána).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaccáyana's work shows clearly the influence of Sanskrit grammar, chiefly the Kátantra. Many later works were written about the Kaccáyana (as it is called) or were based on it, the chief among them being the Rúpasiddhi, the Kaccáyanabheda, the Kaccáyanasára and the Kaccáyanavannaná (q.v.).

One day, when he had gone to pay his respects to the king, his mother-in-law visited his wife. The former was deaf, and on asking her daughter if they were happy, and receiving the reply that the husband was a very good man, like a hermit, she heard only the word &quot;hermit,&quot; and she raised a great uproar thinking that her son-in-law had turned hermit. The news spread like wildfire, and as the merchant was on his way home he was told by someone that all the members of his household were weeping because he had become a hermit. Thinking that auspicious words should not be trifled with, the merchant went to the king, took his leave, and became an ascetic in the Himálaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a merchant of Sávatthi to whom the same thing happened when he went to pay his respects to the Buddha (J.ii.63-5). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is also given in the Játakamálá, where it is called the Sresthi Játaka (No.20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Mára appears in the guise of a peasant, dishevelled, wearing hempen garments, with a mighty plough on his shoulder, and asks the Buddha if he has seen his oxen.

It was here that Pandukábhaya captured the Yakkhiní Cetiyá (Mhv.x.59). This was a strategic point in the wars with the Tamils, and we find Kákavannatissa entrusting its protection to his son Díghábhaya (Mhv.xxiii.17). It is probable that, some time afterwards, the place fell into the hands of the Tamils, for we find Dutthagámaní mentioned as having captured it from the Tamil general Kapisísa (Mhv.xxv.12). According to the Mahávamsa Tíká (322, 366) the place was nine leagues from Anurádhapura, but Nimila journeyed there and back in one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Commentary (i.367) mentions that a man named Mahávácakála was once born there as a crocodile, a fathom in length, for having cast doubts on the efficacy of the Buddha's religion. Once he swallowed sixty carts with the bulls attached to them, the carts being filled with stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ford is now identified with Mahágantota, the spot where the Ambanganga and the Mahaveliganga meet (Geiger, Mhv.Trs., 72, n.2). The Ambanganga was probably called Kacchakanadí, and at the spot where it met the Mahaveliganga, King Subha built the Nandigámaka-vihára.

The village was the birthplace of Bharana, one of Dutthagámaní's generals (Mhv.xxiii.64). On the river was a ford called Javamála, crossed by Dutthagámaní while fleeing from his brother Tissa (Mhv.xxiv.22). According to this context, the river must have been in Rohana, and Geiger (Mhv.Trs.165, n.5) thinks that it is probably identical with the modern Kumbukkan-Oya. The Mahávamsa Tika (p.593) says that Malayamahádeva came to Kappakandara Piyangudípa to receive alms from Dutthagámaní.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Rasaváhiní (Ras.ii.160) the village was near Cittalapabbata Vihára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Samuddajá threw him on to the ground with a shriek and accidentally struck his eye with her nail, thereby blinding him. Henceforth he, whose name had been Arittha, was known as Kánárittha (J.vi.168). When, after Bhúridatta's disappearance (see Bhúridatta Játaka) from the Nága-world, his brothers set out to search for him, Kánárittha was sent to the world of the gods, for he was so cruel by nature that they knew that if he went to the world of men he would destroy it by fire (J.vi.190). When, after his search, he returned to the Nága-world, he was appointed doorkeeper of Bhúridatta's sick-room; there, seeing Subhaga dragging a brahmin roughly into the Nága-world, he prevented him from ill-treating the man and told him of the greatness of all brahmins, illustrating his words with various stories (J.vi.197; details see pp.200ff). It is said that in his immediately preceding birth, he had been a brahmin, well-versed in sacrificial lore. Bhúridatta heard (from his bed) Arittha's undue praise of brahmins and refuted his statements (J.vi.205ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kánárittha is identified with Sunakkhatta (J.vi.219).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kákavaliya, Kákavalliya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the five bankers (setthi) of limitless wealth in Bimbisára's kingdom, the others being Jotiya, Jatila, Mendaka, and Punnaka (DhA.i.385; AA.i.220). He was once very poor, and Mahá-Kassapa, having spent seven days in samádhi, stood at his door, wishing to do him a favour. Kákavaliya's wife saw the Elder and poured into his bowl the saltless sour gruel she had cooked for her husband. The Elder took it and put it into the hands of the Buddha, who resolved that it should suffice for the large assembly of monks. On the seventh day after that, Kákavaliya was appointed setthi (Vsm.ii.403). He is quoted as an example of one who was able to give gifts which bore fruit in this very existence, because his gift contained the four purities: lawful acquisition, greatness of volition, virtue in the recipient and consummate virtue in the giver.

It is said that when Kanthaka was saddled for the journey, he realised the importance of the hour and neighed loudly for joy, but the gods muffled the sound of his neighing as also that of his footsteps as he galloped through the streets; ordinarily the sound of his neighing and galloping could be heard throughout Kapilavatthu. He was eighteen cubits long from neck to tail and proportionately broad, quite white in colour, like a clean conch-shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this journey of Gotama, Channa held on to Kanthaka's tail. The horse had the strength, had it been necessary, to clear the ramparts of the city, eighteen hands high, at one bound, with the prince and Channa on his back. Just outside Kapilavatthu the prince stopped the horse, in order to take a last look at the city. A cetiya was later erected on this spot and called Kanthakanivatta-cetiya. The horse travelled thirty leagues between midnight and the following morning, as far as the river Anomá. It is said that Kanthaka could travel round the whole cakka-vála in one night. With one leap the horse cleared the river, which was eight fathoms wide. On arriving on the opposite bank, the Bodhisatta gave orders that Kanthaka should be taken back to Kapilavatthu, but Kanthaka kept looking back at his master, and when the Bodhisatta disappeared from view the horse died of a broken heart, and was reborn in Távatimsa under the name of Kanthaka-devaputta. (J.i.62-5; Mtu.ii.159f., 165, 189, 190; VibhA.34, etc.; Buddhacarita, v.3, 68; vi.53ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kanthaka was born on the same day as the Bodhisatta (J.i.54; BuA.106, 234, etc.). In heaven he had a magnificent palace </data>

They had made mud-pies together and had gone to the same school. Later, Kálakanní fell on evil days and sought the protection of his friend, who appointed him to look after his business. Anáthapindika's friends and acquaintances remonstrated against the employment of a man with so inauspicious a name, but Anáthapindika heeded them not. One day, when Anáthapindika was away, a gang of robbers tried to enter his house, but Kálakanní, with great presence of mind, asked the few remaining servants to beat drums all over the house, thereby giving the impression that the house was fully occupied. The robbers fled leaving their weapons, and Kálakanní was greatly praised. When Anáthapindika reported the matter to the Buddha, the Buddha related the Kálakanní Játaka, containing a similar story of the past. J.i.364f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kálakanní.-The name of the treasurer's friend in the story of the past, as given in the Kálakanní Játaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kálakanní.-Daughter of Virúpakkha. She had a dispute with Sirí, daughter of Dhatarattha, as to their order of precedence in bathing in Anotatta. The story is given in the Siri-Kálakanni Játaka (J.iii.257ff). In the story she is also addressed as Kálí (J.iii.261). In another place she is referred to as Alakkhí. J.iv.378.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kassapagotta.-Apparently the general name given to those belonging to the family of Kassapas. Thus the Ájívaka Guna is addressed as Kassapagotta (J.vi.222) and again as Kassapa (J.vi.224, 229, 235). See also &lt;a href="kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; (28).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kassapagotta.-A monk living in Vásabhagáma in the Kási kingdom. He was in the habit of showing extreme hospitality to the monks who came there from other parts. Once some monks who visited him enjoyed his hospitality and stayed on. After some time, feeling that they had outstayed their welcome, Kassapagotta grew tired of looking after them and was blamed by them for his neglect. He therefore went to Campá, where he laid his case before the Buddha, who declared that no blame attached to him. Vin.i.312ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kassapagotta.-A monk living in Pankadhá in the Kosala country. He heard the Buddha preach a sermon, but was not satisfied with it and kept on thinking: &quot;This recluse&quot; (meaning the Buddha) &quot;is much too scrupulous&quot; (adhisallikhat'eváyam). Later, he was filled with remorse and, having sought the Buddha at Rájagaha, begged forgiveness for his thoughtlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha praised him for having seen his transgression, and for his confession thereof and determination to practise self-restraint. A.i.236f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kassapagotta.-A monk, perhaps to be identified with one of the foregoing. He was once staying in a forest tract in Kosala and, seeing a trapper pursuing deer, intervened and protested against the man's earning his living by such cruel means. The trapper was too preoccupied with his quarry to pay much attention to what was said. A deva of the forest drew near the monk and instructed him not to waste his time in preaching to a </data>
<data>man who heard but did not understand what was being said. Kassapa was agitated and, according to the Commentary, gave himself up to much striving and became an arahant. S.i.198f; SA.i.223.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;.

She entered the Order when she grew up and became an arahant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her past birth, when she was listening to a sermon at the end of celebrations held at Devaputta in honour of the Bowl Relic, a Nága king fell in love with her. When she refused his attentions, the Nága wrapt her body with his coils, but she continued to listen unmoved. By power of her virtue the Nága was subdued, and he paid her great honour by means of an Udakapújá. Ras.i.34f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kasí-Bháradvája&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin of the Bháradvája clan, living at Ekanálá, in Dakkhinágiri. The Buddha visited him in the eleventh year after the Enlightenment (Thomas, op. cit., p.117). The brahmin was so called on account of his profession of agriculture. On the day of his festive sowing (mangalavappa), the Buddha visited him alone (having seen his upanissaya for arahantship), and stood near the place where food was being distributed to a very large number of people engaged in the festival. The brahmin, seeing the Buddha begging for alms, suggests that the Buddha should work for his living - plough and sow just as he does. (The Sútrálankára says the brahmin threw water on the Buddha in order to drive him away; Sylvain Levy, JA.1908, xii.99). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha answers that he, too, is a farmer, and explains his meaning to the bewildered brahmin, who, greatly pleased, offers him a large bowl filled with milk-rice. The Buddha refuses the gift on the plea that Buddhas never accept wages for their sermons. At the Buddha's own suggestion the food is cast into the river because no one is capable of digesting food once offered to a Tathágata. (The food had become too rich because the gods had added ojá to it; see also Mil.231). When the rice touches the water it crackles and smokes and the brahmin, greatly marvelling, falls at the Buddha's feet and professes himself henceforth the Buddha's follower. Soon after, he enters the Order, and in due course becomes an arahant. Sn.12ff; SnA.131ff; the Samyutta does not mention his arahantship (S.i.171ff), though the Commentary does so (SA.i.188ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha explains that his teaching is that no one can know and see everything at one and the same time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king proceeds to ask whether there is any distinction of caste in the matter of deliverance and whether there are any gods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/viduudabha')"&gt;Vidúdabha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; join in the discussion, and then&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjaya')"&gt;Sañjaya Ákásagotta&lt;/a&gt;, charged with having spread a wrong interpretation of the Buddha's teaching, is announced and lays the blame on Vidúdabha.

In terror they left the district. The Bodhisatta, being born among the elephants, took leave of his father, and went back into the lake with his friends. The Bodhisatta, being the last to leave the water, was caught by the crab's claws; hearing his cries of pain, all the other elephants ran away except his mate, whom he entreated not to leave him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realizing her duty, the she-elephant spoke to the crab words of coaxing and of flattery; the crab, fascinated by the sound of a female voice, let go his hold. Whereupon the Bodhisatta trampled him to death. From the two claws of the crab were later made the Ánaka and the Álambara drums (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the wife of a landowner of Sávatthi. Husband and wife were on their way to collect some debts when they were waylaid by robbers. The robber chief, wishing to possess the wife for her beauty, planned to kill the husband. The wife expressed her determination to commit suicide if her husband were killed, and they were both released. The she-elephant of the Játaka was the landowner's wife (J.ii.341-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Játaka is illustrated in the Barhut Stupa (Cunningham; Bharhut plate xxv.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kakkata Játaka is mentioned (DhA.i.119) among those preached by the Buddha giving instances where Ananda offered his life for that of the Bodhisatta. The reference is evidently to the Suvannakakkata Játaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is also found in the Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.167), but there the Bodhisatta's life is saved not by his mate </data>

Some of the Buddha's eminent disciples who were with the Buddha, such as Cála, Upacála, Kakkata, Kalimbha, Nikata and Katissaha, therefore, retired into various woodland solitudes, such as Gosingasálávana, which were close by. The Buddha praised them, saying that noise was an obstruction to meditation, and preached this sutta on the ten kinds of obstruction (A.v.133-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He became the chief pupil of a world-famed teacher in Takkasilá, who was in the habit of preaching the moral law to whomever he met regardless of their fitness to receive it. One day Kárandiya was sent with his colleagues by his teacher to accept some cakes offered by the inhabitants of a village and to bring the teacher's share. On the way back Kárandiya saw a cave and started throwing stones into it. Told of this by the other boys, the teacher questioned Kárandiya, who replied that it was his ambition to make the whole world level. If his teacher thought he could make the whole world moral, why should he himself not make it level? The teacher understood and accepted the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Sáriputta who preached to all who came to him, including even hunters and fishermen. They listened to him with respect, but failed to follow his teaching. On the remonstrance of his colleagues Sáriputta was offended, and the matter came to the Buddha's knowledge. Sáriputta is identified with the teacher of old. J.iii.170-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The story was related by the Buddha to the monks, who expressed great wonder at the miracles performed by him at Sankassa. It was not only in his last birth that he performed wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old woman in the story is identified with Uppalavaná (J.i.193ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is also given in the Anguttara Commentary (i.415), with a few additional details. The Dhammapada Commentary (iii.213) refers to it as the Kanhausabha Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kanha Játaka (No.440).-The story of Kanha-tápasa. He was the only son of a brahmin in Benares and inherited great wealth; he was educated at Takkasilá. When his parents died he gave away all his wealth and retired to the Himalaya, where he practised rigid asceticism, never entering a village, eating the produce of only one tree, and living not even in a hut. He acquired great mystic powers, and Sakka's throne was heated by his virtue. Sakka visited him and, having tested him and asked him various questions, granted him six boons. The ascetic chose only such things as pertained to the life of renunciation. Sakka decreed that the tree under which the ascetic lived should bear fruit perennially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sakka of the story was Anuruddha. It is said that the acetic was called Kanha on account of his dark complexion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Ananda in explanation of the Buddha's smile as he was passing a certain spot in the Nigrodháráma in Kapilavatthu; it was the spot where the ascetic Kanha practised his meditations.

Kálinga, Kalinga.&lt;/b&gt;-An inhabitant of Ñátika.While staying in Ñátika, at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ginjakaavasatha')"&gt;Giñjakávasatha&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha tells Ananda that Kálinga was reborn after death in the Suddhavásá, and that there he would attain to nibbána. D.ii.92; S.v.358f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kálinga.&lt;/b&gt;-A country: the Kálingarattha. It is one of the seven political divisions mentioned in the time of the mythical king &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/renu')"&gt;Renu&lt;/a&gt; and is given first in the list, its capital being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dantapura')"&gt;Dantapura&lt;/a&gt; and its king Sattabhú. (D.ii.235f; see also Mtu.iii.208; the Mtu. also mentions a king Uggata of Dantapura, iii.364f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not, however, included in the list of sixteen Janapadas appearing in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.i.213, etc.), but is found in the extended list of the Niddesa (CNid.ii.37). A later tradition (Bu.xviii.6) states that after the Buddha's death, a Tooth was taken from among his relics and placed at Kálinga, where it was worshipped. From Kálinga the Tooth was brought to Ceylon, in the time of King Sirimeghavanna, by Hemamálá, daughter of Guhasíva, king of Kálinga, and her husband Dantakumára, a prince of the Ujjeni royal family. In Ceylon the Tooth became the &quot;Palladium&quot; of the Sinhalese kings. (Cv.xxxvii.92; see also Cv.Trs.i.7, n.4; the Dáthádhátuvamsa gives details, J.P.T.S.1884, pp.108ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játakas contain various references to Kálinga. There was once a great drought in Dantapura, and the king, acting on the advice of his ministers, sent brahmins to the king of Kuru to beg the loan of his state elephant, Añjanavasabha, credited with the power of producing rain. </data>
<data>On this occasion, however, the elephant failed and the Kálinga king, hearing of the virtues practised by the king and people of Dantapura, offered them himself, upon which rain fell. See the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurudhamma_jat_276')"&gt;Kurudhamma Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, J.ii.367ff, also DhA.iv.88f. A similar story is related in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara')"&gt;Vessantara Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, vi.487, where the Kálinga brahmins ask for and obtain Vessantara's white elephant that he may stay the drought in Kálinga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another king of Kálinga was a contemporary of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aruna')"&gt;Aruna&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assaka')"&gt;Assaka&lt;/a&gt; king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/potali')"&gt;Potali&lt;/a&gt;. The Kálinga king, in his eagerness for a fight, picked a quarrel with Aruna, but was worsted in battle, and had to surrender his four daughters with their dowries to Aruna (J.iii.3f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="kaalingabodhi_jat_479')"&gt;Kálingabodhi Játaka&lt;/a&gt; relates the story of another ruler of Kálinga while, according to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhanga_jat_522')"&gt;Sarabhanga Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, a certain king of Kálinga (J.v.135f) went with two other kings, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthaka')"&gt;Atthaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhiimaratha')"&gt;Bhímaratta&lt;/a&gt;, to ask Sarabhanga questions referring to the fate of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandakii')"&gt;Dandakí&lt;/a&gt;. There they heard the sage preach, and all three kings became ascetics. Another king of Kálinga was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalikira')"&gt;Nálikíra&lt;/a&gt;, who, having ill-treated a holy man, was swallowed up in the Sunakha-niraya, while his country was laid waste by the gods and turned into a wilderness (Kálingárañña). The Kálinga-arañña is referred to in the Upáli Sutta (M.i.378); the story is related in J.v.144 and, in greater </data>
<data>detail, in MA.ii.602ff. In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumbhakaara_jat_408')"&gt;Kumbhakára Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.376) the Kálinga king's name is Karandu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From early times there seems to have been political intercourse between the peoples of Kálinga and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vanga')"&gt;Vanga&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiimaa')"&gt;Susímá&lt;/a&gt;, grandmother of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vijaya')"&gt;Vijaya&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Sinhalese race, was a Kálinga princess, married to the king of Vanga (Mhv.vi.1; Dpv.ix.2ff). Friendly relations between Ceylon and Kálinga were evidently of long standing, for we find in the reign of Aggabodhi II. (601-11 A.C.) the king of Kálinga, together with his queen and his minister, coming over to Ceylon intent on leading the life of a recluse and joining the Order under Jotipála. Aggabodhi and his queen treated them with great honour (Cv.xlii.44ff). Later, the queen consort of Mahinda IV. came from Kálinga and Vijayabáhu I. married a Kálinga princess, Tilokasundarí (Cv.lix.30). We are told that scions of the Kálinga dynasty had many times attained to the sovereignty of Ceylon and that there were many ties of relationship between the royal families of the two countries (Cv.lxiii.7, 12f). But it was Mágha, an offspring of the Kálinga kings, who did incomparable damage to Ceylon and to its religion and literature (Cv.lxxx.58ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the inscriptions, Asoka, in the thirteenth year of his reign, conquered Kálinga and this was the turning-point in his career, causing him to abhor war (Mookerji: Asoka, pp.16, 37, 214). Among the retinue sent by him to accompany the branch of the Sacred Bodhi Tree on its journey to Ceylon, were eight families of Kálinga (Sp.i.96).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asoka's brother Tissa, later known as Ekaviháriya, spent his retirement in the Kálinga country with his instructor </data>
<data>Dhammarakkhita, and there Asoka built for him the Bhojakagiri-vihára (ThagA.i.506).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara_jat_547')"&gt;Vessantara Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.521), the brahmin village Dunnivittha, residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/juujaka')"&gt;Jújaka&lt;/a&gt;, was in Kálinga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kálinga is generally identified with the modern Orissa. (CAGI.590ff; Law: Early Geography, 64; see also Bhandarkar: Anct. Hist. of Deccan, p.12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kálinga.&lt;/b&gt;-Various kings of Kálinga are mentioned either as Kálingarájá or simply as Kálinga. For these see Kálinga (2). We also hear of Culla Kálinga and Mahá Kálinga. Culla Kálinga is sometimes called Kálinga-kumára (J.iv.230).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Kálinga.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Culla-Kálinga.

Kálinga.&lt;/b&gt;-A Damila chief, ally of Kulasekhara (Cv.lxxvi.174, 214, 217, 222). He was a brother of the wife of Tondamána. Cv.lxxvii.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

It was near Kañcana-guhá, and on it grew the Abbhantaramba of Vessavana. On the mountain, in a hut, lived the ascetic Jotirasa, tending the sacred fire. The mountain formed one of the salient features of the Himálaya region (J.v.415). It is in the northern quarter of Himavá, and from its slopes flows the Sídánadí (J.vi.101). In the Nimi Játaka (J.vi.100) mention is made of two Kañcanapabbatá between which the Sídánadí flows. The mountain is sometimes referred to as Kañcanagiri (E.g., UdA.411) and sometimes as Suvannapabbata (J.vi.100). The Buddha Sumana held his second assembly of disciples on the Kañcanapabbata, when ninety thousand crores of people were present (J.i.34).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kálingabodhi Játaka (No.479)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kálinga king of Dantapura had two sons, Mahá Kálinga and Culla Kálinga. Soothsayers foretold that the younger would be an ascetic, but that his son would be a Cakka-vatti. Knowing of this prophecy, Culla Kálinga became so arrogant that Mahá Kálinga, on coming to the throne, ordered his arrest. But Culla Kálinga fled to Himavá and lived there as an ascetic. Near his hermitage lived the king and queen of Madda who had fled with their daughter from their city of Ságala. Soothsayers had predicted that the princess's son would be a Cakka-vatti, and all the kings of Jambudípa sought her hand. Her parents, not wishing to incur the enmity of any of the kings, fled with her from the city. One day a wreath of mango-flowers which the princess dropped into the river was picked up by Culla Kálinga, who thereupon went in search of her. With her parents' consent he married her, and to these two was born a son whom they called Kálinga.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the stars revealed that Mahá Kálinga had died, Kálinga was sent to Dantapura, to a courtier who had been an ally of Culla Kálinga. The prince's identity having been duly established, he was crowned king, and his chaplain, Kálinga-bháradvája, taught him the duties of a Cakka-vatti. On the fifteenth day after his coronation, the tokens of a Cakka-vatti king appeared before him. (For details see J.iv.232). One day while riding through the air with his retinue, he came to the Bodhi-tree under which Buddhas attain Enlightenment, and though he prodded his elephant until it died the animal found it impossible to fly over the spot. The royal chaplain investigated matters and reported his finding to the king who, having learnt from the chaplain of a Buddha's virtues, paid great honour to the tree for seven </data>
<data>days. See also Samanakolañña.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kálinga is identified with Ananda and Kálinga-bháradvája with the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Bodhi-tree planted, at Ananda's suggestion, by Anáthapindika, at the entrance to Jetavana, in order that people might worship it while the Buddha was away on tour. As soon as a seedling was planted from the great Bodhi-tree at Gayá, it grew into a tree fifty cubits high, and the Buddha consecrated it by spending one night under it, wrapt in meditation (J.iv.228-36).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kálingabodhi Játaka is found also in the Mahábodhi-vamsa (Mbv.62ff ); there it is given in much greater detail and differs in minor details from the Játaka version, containing, among other things, a long description of dibba-cakkhu and the seven gems of a Cakka-vatti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the people complained of him to the king, the latter had him arrested by the governor of the province and condemned to death. While being led to execution with a wreath of red kanavera-flowers on his head, he was seen by Sámá, the chief courtesan of the city, and she immediately fell in love with him for his comely and striking appearance. Sámá, sending word to the governor that the robber was her brother, persuaded him, by means of a bribe of one thousand pieces of money, to set him free and send him to her for a little while. Then, using all her guile, she substituted for the robber a youth who was enamoured of her and who had happened to visit her that day. This youth was killed in the place of the robber, who was brought to Sámá, and she showered on him all her favours. Fearing that when Sámá grew tired of him she might betray him, the robber went with her one day into the park and, on the pretence of embracing her, squeezed her till she swooned, then taking all her ornaments, made good his escape. Sámá, all unsuspecting, imagined him to have run away from fear of having killed her by his too violent embraces, and she used all her ingenuity in searching for him, such as bribing some wandering minstrels to sing, wherever they went, a set of stanzas declaring that she was still alive and loved none but him, her lover. One day the robber heard the stanzas and learned from the minstrels that Sámá still longed for him, but he refused to return, sending her word that he doubted her constancy. In despair, Sámá returned to her former means of livelihood. J.iii.58-63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The occasion for the telling of this story is given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/indriya_jat_423')"&gt;Indriya Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.

A monk should not give way to anger even though he be sawn limb from limb with a two-handed saw (ubhatodandakena kakacena). The name of the sutta was given by the Buddha himself (M.i.122ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta contains the story of the lady of Sávatthi, called Videhiká, who had a reputation for gentleness until tested by her servant girl and found wanting. The saw is only one of numerous similes which occur in the discourse. It is quoted in the Maháhatthipadopama Sutta (M.i.189), and is elsewhere (E.g., DA.i.123) given as an example of a sutta preached on account of someone's lack of patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Katamorakatissa was held in high esteem by Thullánandá, for we are told that one day, on arriving at a house where she was a constant visitor, and on being told that several of the Buddha's eminent disciples, such as Sáriputta, Moggallána, Mahá Kaccána, had also been invited, as they happened to be at Veluvana near by, she expressed great disappointment that these had been invited, when such most eminent disciples (mahánágá) as Devadatta, Katamorakatissa, etc., were available. Vin.iv.66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, wishing to ordain a nun who was going through a probationary course, she summoned the monks, but seeing a great quantity of food and wishing to let only her favourites enjoy it, she dismissed the monks on a false pretext, keeping with her only Devadatta, Katamorakatissa and their colleagues (Vin.iv.335).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katamorakatissaka was one of the monks about whom dissatisfaction was expressed to the Buddha, by the two Pacceka-brahma, Subrahmá and Suddhávása.

Sáriputta says that Moliya-Phagguna did not find satisfaction in the Dhamma, and assures Kalára that he himself has no doubts whatever either about the past or about the future. Kalára reports this conversation to the Buddha, who sends for Sáriputta and asks him a series of questions. The Buddha praises his answers, but Sáriputta confesses to his colleagues later that he felt nervous over the first question, but when the Buddha accepted his answer to that he recovered his confidence.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Kála-Buddharakkhita&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Thera of Ceylon, an arahant. He belonged to a minister's family and was born in a village near Dakkhinagiri-vihára. When he came of age, he entered the Order, learned the whole of the Tipitaka, and, on going with a large concourse to see his teacher, was asked to give up his following and go into solitude to practise meditation. He went to the Vátakasitapabbata-vihára, practised meditation and became an arahant. While living in the Cetiyapabbata-vihára, he was once worshipping at the Kantaka-cetiya and was seated at the foot of a Kálatimabara tree. (Legend says on the night of the new moon, thus completing the circle of Kálas). One of the monks asked him a question on the Kálakáráma Sutta and the Elder preached a sermon based on the sutta. King Tissa (probably Saddhá-Tissa), who was in the vicinity, came to listen to the sermon, which lasted throughout the night; the king remained standing the whole time. Greatly pleased, the king, at the end of the sermon, offered the sovereignty of Ceylon to the monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the Elder had been the Nigantha Mahá-Saccaka in the time of the Buddha, and that the Buddha had preached to him the Mahá-Saccaka Sutta, not because he could understand it then, but because the Buddha knew that it would help him to rise to eminence in this last life as Kála-Buddharakkhita.

It was evidently an important centre even in the time of Devánampiya-Tissa, because we find that the nobles of Kájaragáma are mentioned among those taking part in the festival of the Bodhi-Tree when it was brought over by Sanghamittá (Mhv.xix.54). In the village was planted one of the eight saplings produced from the Bodhi-Tree (Mhv.xix.62; Mbv.161f; Sp.i.100). A vihára was erected in Kácaragáma by Aggabodhi, ruler of Rohana (Cv.xlv.45), among the occupants of which is mentioned Milakkha-Tissa Thera (AA.i.22). The place was of strategic importance, and was sometimes used as the seat of the government in Rohana. E.g., by Loka (Cv.lvii.2), by Kassapa, the Kesadhátu (Cv.lvii.66ff); see also Cv.lviii.6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The village is now chiefly famous for the celebrated shrine of Skanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kankhá-Revata Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a very wealthy family in Sávatthi. One day, after his midday meal, he went with others to hear the Buddha preach and, accepting the word of the Buddha, he entered the Order. According to the Apadána (ii.491), he heard the Buddha preach at Kapilavatthu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He attained arahantship by way of practising jhána, and so proficient in jhána did he become that the Buddha declared him chief of the monks who practised it (A.i.24; Ud.v.9; AA.i.129f; Thag.3; ThagA.33f). Before he became an arahant he was greatly troubled in mind as to what was permissible for him to use and what was not (akappiyá muggá, na kappanti muggá paribhuñjitum, etc.). This characteristic of his became well known, hence his name (UdA.314).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara he was a brahmin of Hamsavatí, well versed in the Vedas. One day, while listening to the Buddha's preaching, he heard him declare a monk in the assembly as chief among those who practised jhána, and himself wished for the same honour under a future Buddha (Ap.ii.419f). He is often mentioned in company with other very eminent disciples - e.g., Anuruddha, Nandiya, Kimbila, Kundadhána and Ananda - at the preaching of the Nalakapána Sutta (M.i.462). The Mahágosinga Sutta (M.i.212ff) records a discussion between Moggallána, Mahá Kassapa, Anuruddha, Revata and Ananda, and there we find Revata praising, as the highest type of monk, one who delights in meditation and has his habitation in the abodes of solitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kankhá-Revata appears to have survived the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Uttaramátu-peta Vatthu (PvA.141ff), Uttara's mother having been born as a peta, and having wandered about for fifty-five years without water, came upon Revata enjoying the siesta </data>
<data>on the banks of the Ganges and begged him for succor. Having learnt her story, Revata gave various gifts to the Sangha in her name, and so brought her happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Káladíghagáma&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in Ceylon, evidently near Kalyáni Vihára, for the monks of the vihára are spoken of as visiting the village for alms. A girl of the village once met a young monk who went there, and fell in love so deeply that she died of her longing for him; when the monk realised what he had missed by not being aware of her love, he, too, died of a broken heart. SnA.i.70; ApA.i.128; the story is slightly different in AA.i.13f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When he died the elder refused the crown and retired into a frontier village. The people there, discovering his identity, offered to pay their taxes to him instead of to the king, and the king, at his request, agreed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his power increased, the prince became more covetous and demanded the kingdom, which the younger brother gladly renounced. But the elder's greed was insatiable, and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;, to teach him a lesson, came in the guise of a young man and offered to capture for him three cities. The king made up his mind to accept the offer; but, then the young man could not be found, and the king fell ill of greed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, just returned from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt;, heard of this, and having obtained the king's leave to treat him, cured him of this disease by showing him the futility of his wishes. Thereafter the king became a righteous ruler (J.iv.167ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the brahmin to whom the &lt;a href="kaama_s')"&gt;Káma Sutta&lt;/a&gt; was preached. The&lt;a href="kaamaniita_jat_228')"&gt;Kámaníta Játaka&lt;/a&gt; was also preached in this connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kakkhala&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nickname given to Jetthatissa I. When certain of his ministers chewed reluctance to accompany his father's funeral procession, he finally persuaded them; but when they were assembled he had the gates shut on them, put them to death, and had their bodies empaled on stakes round his father's pyre. Hence his name. Mhv.xxxvi.118-22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day she went with Kálí to hear the thera Sona Kutikanna preach to his mother, and while she was there thieves entered her house. The servant girl, who was sent to fetch oil for lighting the lamps, brought news of the presence of the thieves, but Kátiyáni refused to leave until the thera's sermon should be finished. The leader of the thieves, who had watched the incident, was so pleased with her that he gave orders that all the goods stolen from her house should be restored. At the end of the sermon Kátiyáni became a sotápanna. The next day the thieves came and asked her forgiveness. She took them to the Elder, who ordained them, and there they all became arahants.

See also Watanabe's article, &quot;The Story of Kalmásapáda and its Evolution in Indian Literature.&quot; J.P.T.S.1909, pp.236ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place where the porisáda was tamed was called &lt;a href="kammaasadamma')"&gt;Kammásadamma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kandari Játaka (No.341)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kandari, a king of Benares, was very handsome; each day he received one thousand boxes of perfume for his use, and his food was cooked with scented wood. His wife, Kinnará, was very beautiful; his chaplain was Pañcálacanda. One day, Kinnará, on looking out, saw a loathsome cripple in the shade of a jambu-tree near her window, and conceived a passion for the man. Thereafter she would wait for the king to fall asleep and would then, nightly, visit the cripple, taking him dainty foods and having her pleasure with him. One day the king, returning from a procession, saw the misshapen creature, and asked the chaplain if such a man could ever win the love of a woman. The cripple, hearing the question, proudly boasted of his intimacy with the queen. At the chaplain's suggestion the king watched the queen's movements that same night, and saw the cripple abuse her and strike her for being late in coming. The blow fell on her ear breaking off her ear ornament, which the king picked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day he ordered the queen to appear before him in all her ornaments, and having proved that he knew of her infidelity, handed her over to the chaplain to be executed. Pañcálacanda, pitying the woman, begged that she should be pardoned, because in being unchaste she had but obeyed the instincts common to all women. To prove his contention, Pañcálacanda took the king with him and, in disguise, they wandered through Jambudípa, testing the virtue of various women, including that of a young bride who was being taken to her husband's house. Convinced that all women were alike, the king spared Kinnará's life, but drove her out of the palace together with the cripple, and caused the jambu-tree to be cut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was among those related by the </data>

Kappa.&lt;/b&gt;-One of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari')"&gt;Bávarí's&lt;/a&gt; disciples. The questions he asked of the Buddha are recorded in the Kappamánavapucchá (q.v.). He became an arahant. Sn.vv.1007, 1092-5; SnA.ii.597.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kappa Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant. He was the son of a provincial governor in Magadha and was addicted to self-indulgence. The Buddha, seeing him in his net of wisdom, visited him and admonished him, speaking to him of the filthy nature of the body, illustrating his sermon with a wealth of simile and metaphor. Kappa was greatly impressed and joined the Order. He became an arahant, as his head was being shaved. In the time of the Buddha Siddhattha he was a rich householder, and offered at the Buddha's shrine a kapparukkha containing objects of great value. Wherever he was born celestial trees grew outside his door. Seven kappas ago he was eight times king under the name of Sucela (Thag.567-76; ThagA.i.521ff). He is probably identical with Kapparukkhiya of the Apadána. Ap.i.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kappa.&lt;/b&gt;-In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.iii.169f) two suttas are connected with a monk called Kappa, who is probably identical with Kappa (2). In both suttas he asks the Buddha how it is possible to cultivate knowledge and thought so as to be free from thoughts of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; with regard to the body. The same questions, receiving the same answers, are elsewhere attributed to Ráhula. S.ii.253f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Kappa.&lt;/b&gt;-A young brahmin (Kappakamára) who was the Bodhisatta. He later became a sage and the disciple and friend of Kesava. For his story see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kesava_jat_346')"&gt;Kesava Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.142ff). The story is also </data>

Kassapa Buddha.&lt;/b&gt;-Also called Kassapa Dasabala to distinguish him from other Kassapas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twenty-fourth Buddha, the third of the present neon (the Bhaddakappa) and one of the seven Buddhas mentioned in the Canon (D.ii.7).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in Benares, in the Deer Park at Isipatana,  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;of brahmin parents, Brahmadatta and Dhanavatí, belonging to the Kassapagotta.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two thousand years he lived in the household, in three different palaces, Hamsa, Yasa and Sirinanda. (The BuA.217 calls the first two palaces Hamsavá and Yasavá).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had as chief wife Sunandá, by whom he begot a son, Vijitasena.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa left the world, traveling in his palace (pásáda), and practiced austerities for only seven days.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before his Enlightenment his wife gave him a meal of milk-rice, and a yavapála named Soma gave him grass for his seat.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bodhi was a banyan-tree, and  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;he preached his first sermon at Isipatana to a crore of monks who had renounced the world in his company.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He performed the Twin-Miracle at the foot of an asana-tree outside Sundaranagara.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He held only one assembly of his disciples; among his most famous conversions was that of a yakkha, Naradeva (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His chief disciples were Tissa and Bháradvája among monks, and Anulá and </data>
<data>Uruvelá among nuns, his constant attendant being Sabbamitta.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among his patrons, the most eminent were Sumangala and Ghattíkára, Vijitasená and Bhaddá.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His body was twenty cubits high, and,  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;after having lived for twenty thousand years, he died in the Setavya pleasance at Setavyá in Kásí.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over his relics was raised a thúpa one league in height, each brick of which was worth one crore.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MA.i.336ff ) that there was a great difference of opinion as to what should be the size of the thúpa and of what material it should be constructed; when these points were finally settled and the work of building had started, the citizens found they had not enough money to complete it. Then an anágámí devotee, named Sorata, went all over Jambudípa, enlisting the help of the people for the building of the thúpa. He sent the money as he received it, and on hearing that the work was completed, he set out to go and worship the thúpa; but he was seized by robbers and killed in the forest, which later came to be known as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhavana')"&gt;Andhavana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upavána, in a previous birth, became the guardian deity of the cetiya, hence his great majesty in his last life (DA.ii.580; for another story of the building of the shrine see DhA.iii.29).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the thirty-seven goddesses noticed by Guttila, when he visited heaven, was one who had offered a scented five-spray at the cetiya (J.ii.256). So did Aláta offer áneja-flowers and obtain a happy rebirth (J.vi.227).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of Mahá-Kaccána's golden complexion was his gift of a golden brick to the building of Kassapa's shrine </data>
<data>(AA.i.116).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same cetiya, Anuruddha, who was then a householder in Benares, offered butter and molasses in bowls of brass, which were placed without any interval around the cetiya (AA.i.105).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who attained arahantship under Kassapa is mentioned Gavesí, who, with his five hundred followers, strove always to excel themselves until they attained their goal (A.iii.214ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahákappina, then a clansman, built, for Kassapa's monks, a parivena with one thousand cells (AA.i.175).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakkula's admirable health and great longevity were due to the fact that he had given the first fruits of his harvest to Kassapa's monks (MA.iii.932). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the time of Kassapa Buddha, the Bodhisatta was a brahmin youth named Jotipála who, afterwards, coming under the influence of Ghatíkára, became a monk. (Bu.xxv.; BuA.217ff; D.ii.7; J.i.43, 94; D.iii.196; Mtu.i.303ff, 319). This Ghatíkára was later born in the Brahma-world and visited Gotama, after his Enlightenment. Gotama then reminded him of this past friendship, which Ghatíkára seemed too modest to mention (S.i.34f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhima Nikáya (M.ii.45f ) gives details of the earnestness with which Ghatíkára worked for Jotipála's conversion when Kassapa was living at Vehalinga. The same sutta bears evidence of the great regard Kassapa had for Ghatíkára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king of Benares at the time of Kassapa was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kikii')"&gt;Kikí&lt;/a&gt;, and the four gateways of Kassapa's cetiya were built, one by Kikí, one by his son Pathavindhara, one by his ministers led by his general, and the last by his subjects with the treasurer at their head (SnA.i.194).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the Buddha's chief disciple, Tissa, was born on the same day as Kassapa and that they were friends </data>
<data>from birth. Tissa left the world earlier and became an ascetic. When he visited the Buddha after his Enlightenment, he was greatly grieved to learn that the Buddha ate meat (ámagandha), and the Buddha preached to him the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aamagandha')"&gt;Ámagandha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, by which he was converted (SnA.i.280ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ceylon Chronicles (Mhv.xv.128ff; Sp.i.87; Dpv.xv.55ff; Mbv.129) mention a visit paid by Kassapa to Ceylon in order to stop a war between King Jayanta and his younger brother. The island was then known as Mandadípa, with Visála as capital. The Buddha came with twenty thousand disciples and stood on Subhakúta, and the armies seeing him stopped the fight. In gratitude, Jayanta presented to the Buddha the Maháságara garden, in which was afterwards planted a branch of the Bodhi-tree brought over by Sudhammá, in accordance with the Buddha's wish. The Buddha preached at the Asokamálaka, the Sudassanamálaka and the Somanassamálaka, and gave his rain-cloak as a relic to the new converts, for whose spiritual guidance he left behind his disciples Sabbananda and Sudhammá and their followers. In Kassapa's time Mt. Vepulla at Rájagaha was known as Supassa and its inhabitants as the Suppiyas (S.ii.192).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many other places had the same names in the time of Kassapa as they had in the present age - e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/videha')"&gt;Videha&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.122), &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.123),&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kimbilaa')"&gt;Kimbila&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.121) and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Báránasí&lt;/a&gt;. (J.vi.120).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the Ámagandha Sutta mentioned above, various other teachings are mentioned as having been first promulgated by Kassapa and handed on down to the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt; and re-taught by him. Such, for </data>
<data>instance, are the questions (pucchá) of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavaka_puchaa')"&gt;Álavaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya')"&gt;Sabhiya&lt;/a&gt; and the stanzas taught to Sutasoma by the brahmin &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt; of Takkasilá (J.v.476f; 453). The Mittavinda Játaka (No.104) is mentioned as belonging to the days of Kassapa Buddha (J.i.413).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is also made of doctrines which had been taught by Kassapa but forgotten later, and Gotama is asked by those who had heard faint echoes of them to revive them (E.g., MA, i.107, 528; AA.i.423). A sermon attributed to Kassapa, when he once visited Benares with twenty thousand monks, is included in the story of Pandita-Sámanera (DhA.ii.127ff). It was on this occasion that Kassapa accepted alms from the beggar Maháduggata in preference to those offered by the king and the nobles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa held the uposatha only once in six months (DhA.iii.236).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the times of Kassapa and Gotama the surface of the earth grew enough to cover Súkarakata-lena (MA.ii.677).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The records of Chinese pilgrims contain numerous references to places connected with Kassapa. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hiouien Thsang&lt;/a&gt; speaks of a stúpa containing the relics of the whole body of the Buddha, to the north of the town, near Srávasti, where, according to him, Kassapa was born (Beal, op. cit., ii.13). Mention is also made of a footprint of Kassapa (Ibid.i., Introd. ciii). Stories of Kassapa are also found in the Divyávadána (E.g., pp.22f; 344f; 346f; see also Mtu., e.g., i.59, 303f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (iii.250f ) contains a story, which seems to indicate that, near the village of Todeyya, there was a shrine thought to be that of Kassapa and held in high honour by the inhabitants of the village. After the disappearance of Kassapa's Sásana, a class of monks </data>
<data>called Setavattha-samanavamsa (&quot;white-robed recluses&quot;) tried to resuscitate it, but without success (VibhA.432).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kassapa Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-The son of an Udicca-brahmin of Sávatthi, who died when Kassapa was still young. Having heard the Buddha preach at Jetavana, he entered the First Fruit of the Path and, with his mother's leave, became a monk. Some time later, wishing to accompany the Buddha on a tour after the rains, he went to bid his mother farewell, and her admonition to him on that occasion helped him to win insight and become an arahant (Thag.v.82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had been a brahmin versed in the Vedas. One day, seeing the Buddha and wishing to pay homage, he cast a handful of sumana-flowers into the air over the Buddha's head, and the flowers formed a canopy in the sky. In later births he was twenty-five times king, under the name of Cinnamála (v.l. Cittamála). (ThagA.i.177f ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Sereyyaka Thera of the Apadána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-A devaputta. He visited the Buddha late one night at Jetavana and uttered several stanzas, admonishing monks to train themselves in their tasks, laying particular stress on the cultivation of Jhána (S.i.46).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.82) that Kassapa had heard the Buddha preach the Abhidhamma in Távatimsa. Having heard only a portion of the doctrine and not being sure of the admonition given by the Buddha to the monks regarding the practice of Jhána-vibhanga, Kassapa thought he could supply the omission. The Buddha, knowing his capabilities, allowed him to give his views, and expressed his approval at the end of Kassapa's speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-A sage (isi); one of the famous sages of yore, of whom ten are several times mentioned in the books </data>
<data>(E.g., D.i.104, 238; M.ii.169, 200; A.iii.224; iv.61; J.vi.99) as having been brahmin sages, who composed and promulgated the mantras and whose compositions are chanted and repeated and rehearsed by the brahmins of the present day. For details see Atthaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Kassapa &lt;/b&gt;(called Kassapa-mánava).-The Bodhisatta in the time of Piyadassí Buddha. He was a brahmin versed in the Vedas, and having heard the Buddha preach, built a monastery costing one thousand crores. J.i.38; Bu.xiv.9f; BuA.176.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-Another name for Akitti (q.v.). J.iv.240, 241; see also Játakamálá vii.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Kassapa&lt;/b&gt;.-A brahmin ascetic, the Bodhisatta, father of Nárada, whose story is given in the Cúla-Nárada Játaka (q.v.). J.iv.221f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Kassapa&lt;/b&gt;.-A brahmin ascetic, father of the Bodhisatta in the story of the Kassapamandiya Játaka. J.iii.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Kassapa&lt;/b&gt;.-A great sage, the Bodhisatta, father of Isisinga (J.v.157, 159). The scholiast explains that Kassapa was the gotta or family name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Kassapa&lt;/b&gt;.-An ascetic, also called Nárada, who lived in a hermitage near Mt. Kosika in Himavá. He saw the Buddha Padumuttara in the forest, invited him into the hermitage, provided a seat and asked for words of advice. He was a former birth of Ekásanadáyaka Thera. Ap.ii.381.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Kassapa.-&lt;/b&gt;A setthi, probably of Rájagaha, who built the Kassapakáráma, named after him. SA.ii.230.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Dhátusena by a morganatic marriage. He slew his father and became king of Ceylon as Kassapa I. (478-96 A.C.). Fearing the revenge of his brother Moggallána, he erected the </data>
<data>fortress at Síhagiri and dwelt there. Later, repenting of his patricide, he did many meritorious deeds by way of amends (for details see Cv.xxxix.8ff), chief of which was the restoration of the Issarasamanáráma, to which he added buildings named after his daughters, Bodhí and Uppalavanná. In a fight with his brother's forces his army fled in disorder, and Kassapa cut his throat with a dagger. Cv.xxxviii.80ff.; xxxix.1ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Upatissa III. of Ceylon. He had sixteen companions as brave as himself and, with their help, several times repulsed the attacks of Silákála, when the latter revolted against the king. He became known as Girikassapa on account of his prowess. In the last campaign Silákála was victorious, and Kassapa, with his parents and his loyal followers, fled to Merukandara, but they lost their way and were surrounded by Silákála. When the royal elephant fell Kassapa cut his own throat. Cv.xli.8-25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-Younger brother of Aggabodhi III.; he was made viceroy when Mána was killed (Cv.xliv.123f). When Aggabodhi had recovered the kingdom from the usurper Dáthopatissa, which he did only after various reverses in his fortunes, Kassapa abused his influence and plundered various sacred edifices to provide for his army (Cv.xliv.137f). On Aggabodhi's death in exile in Rohana, Kassapa defeated Dáthopatissa, who claimed the throne, and became king in his place (Kassapa II. 641-50). He did not, however, wear a crown, the regalia having probably been stolen. As king he repented of his former misdeeds and did various acts of merit (Cv.xliv.147ff; xlv.1ff). He paid special honour to Mahádhammakathí Thera of Nágasálá and to the Thera of Katandhakára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His children all being young at the time of his death, he entrusted the government to his sister's son, Mána (Cv.xlv.8). </data>
<data>According to the chronicles, Mánavamma was the son of Kassapa (Cv.xlvii.2). He also had a son named Mana (Cv.lvii.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Kassapa&lt;/b&gt; (Kassapa III., 717-24 A.C.).-A younger brother of Aggabodhi V. (?); Kassapa's younger brother was Mahinda I (Cv.xlviii.20-26) and his son Aggabodhi (Cv.xlviii.32).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the three younger brothers of Sena I., the others being Mahinda and Udaya (Cv.l.6). Kassapa was appointed Ádipáda and fought valiantly against the forces of the Pandu king, who was then invading Ceylon, but, finding his efforts of no avail, he fled to Kondiváta (Cv.vv.25ff). He was later killed at Pulatthipura by the orders of the Pandu king (Cv.vv.46). He had four sons, the eldest of whom was named Sena (Cv.vv.47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. Kassapa&lt;/b&gt;.-Son of Kittaggabodhi, ruler of Rohana. When his eldest brother was murdered by his paternal aunt, Kassapa fled to the court of King Sena I., but, later, with Sena's help, he won his father's inheritance (Cv.l.54ff). He was probably killed by the Adipáda Kittaggabodhi. Cv.li.96; and Cv.Trs.i.157, n.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;18. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-Younger brother of Sena II. and Udaya II. He was Mahádipáda or Yuvarája under Udaya (Cv.li.91), and later became king as Kassapa IV. (896-913 A.C.) (Cv.lii.1ff). His daughter Sena married Kassapa V. (Cv.li.93)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;19. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Sena II. The king gave him a special share of his own revenues and a share of the extraordinary revenues of the island (Cv.li.18, 20). Two wives of his are mentioned: Sanghá and Sená (Cv.li.18, 92). He became Yuvarája under Kassapa IV. and ruled over Dakkhinadesa (Cv.lii.1), and, at the death of the king, he became ruler of Ceylon as Kassapa V. (probably 913-23 A.C.) (Cv.lii.37ff). He is sometimes </data>
<data>referred to as the son of the twice-consecrated queen (dvayábhisekajáta), his mother being Sanghá, daughter of Kittaggabodhi (1) and Devá. In inscriptions Kassapa is referred to as Abhaya-Silámegha-vanna (Cv.Trs.i.165, n.3). He was evidently a learned man, and a Sinhalese Commentary to the Dhammapadatthakathá is attributed to him (Edited by D. B. Jayatilaka, Colombo 1933). He had one wife, Vajirá (Cv.lii.62), a second, Devá (Cv.lii.64), and a third, Rájiní (Cv.lii.67). He had a son, Siddhattha, who died young, and another, who was given the title of Sakkasenápati. The latter led an expedition to help the Pandu king against the King of Cola, but he died of plague in Cola (Cv.lii.72-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;20. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Sena V. (Cv.liv.69)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;21. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Mahinda V. (Cv.lv.10). When Mahinda was captured and taken away by the Colas, the people took charge of the young Kassapa and brought him up. When the boy was twelve years old the Cola king sent an army over to Ceylon to seize him; but this plan was frustrated by the official Kitti, of Makkhakudrúsa, and the minister Buddha, of Máragallaka (Cv.lv.24-9). Kassapa ascended the throne as Vikkamabáhu, but refused to be crowned until he should have conquered the Damilas in his kingdom. While preparations were afoot towards this end, he died of a vátaroga. He reigned twelve years (1029-1041 A.C.). (Cv.lvi.1-6; Cv.Trs.i.190, n.3). He is perhaps to be identified with the prince Kassapa who married Lokitá, cousin of Mahinda V., and by whom he had two sons, Moggallána and Loka. Cv.lvii.28f; Cv.Trs.i.195, n.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;22. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-Chief of the Kesadhátus (q.v.). For some time he carried on the government at Rohana, where he defeated the Damilas. He refused to own allegiance to Kitti (afterwards Vijayabáhu I.), </data>
<data>and after six months of rule in Khadirangani, full of resentment that his services against the Damilas had not been recognised, he marched against Kitti and was slain in a battle near Kájaragáma. Cv.lvii.65-75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;23. Kassapa&lt;/b&gt;.-A prince of Jambudípa who, during the reign of Parakkamabáhu I. of Ceylon, sent costly gifts to the king of Rámañña; the Rámañña king forbade the envoys to land and insulted them. This is mentioned as one of the acts which led Parakkamabáhu to send an expedition against Rámañña. Cv.lxxvi.28f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;24. Kassapa Thera&lt;/b&gt;.-According to the Gandhavamsa (p.61) he was the author of the Anágatavamsa and also of the Mohavicchedaní, the Vimaticchedaní and the Buddhavamsa. This Buddhavamsa is evidently not the canonical work of the same name. The Sásanavamsadípa (Verse 1204, see also 1221) says that a Kassapa, an inhabitant of Cola, was the author of a Vimativinodaní. The Sásanavamsa (p.33; see also P.L.C.160) calls this a Vinayatíká and the author an inhabitant of the Damila country. The Mohavicchedaní is there described as a lakkhanagandha (a treatise on grammar?) and is ascribed to another Kassapa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-A Kassapa Thera is mentioned in the Sásanavamsa (p.50) as having been among those responsible for the establishment of the religion in Yonakarattha. He was an inhabitant of Majjhimadesa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;26. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-The Sásanavamsa (p.71) mentions a Kassapa Thera of Arimaddana, in the time of King Narapati. While on tour he reached a country called Pollanka, where the people grew very fond of him and where he became known as Pollanka Thera. Some time later he was crossing to Ceylon and the vessel in which he was refused to move. Lots were drawn, as it was necessary to discover who aboard the vessel was the sinner. The lot fell </data>
<data>repeatedly on Kassapa, because, in a former life, he had harassed a dog in the water. He was accordingly thrown overboard, but was rescued by Sakka, in the form of a crocodile. The thera reached Yakkhadípa (q.v.) and there, as a result of practising compassion, the blind yakkhas gained their sight. Kassapa went later to Síhaladípa, whence he returned home with relics and seeds of the Bodhi-tree and models of the Mahácetiya and Lohapásáda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;27. Kassapa&lt;/b&gt;.-The name is sometimes used as a shortened form of Kassapagotta (q.v.). (E.g., J.vi.224, 225, etc., in reference to the Ájívaka Guna). Nárada-tápasa is also once addressed as Kassapa (J.vi.58).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="28"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;. Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/acela_kassapa')"&gt;Acela Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa')"&gt;Uruvela Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, Kumára°, Gayá°, Dasabala°, Nadí°, Nárada°, Púrana°, Mahá° and Lomasa°.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa was evidently a well-known gotta name (e.g., MA.i.584) and people born in a family bearing that name were often addressed as Kassapa - e.g., Uruvela-Kassapa (AA.i.165) and, again, Nágita Thera (D.i.151).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He illustrated his argument with various similes, among them that of the owner of a barley-field who, seeing among his corn a diseased plant (yava-kárandava) which failed to ripen, would uproot it and throw it away lest the other plants should be affected.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kakusandha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twenty-second of the twenty-four Buddhas and the first of the five Buddhas of the present Bhaddakappa.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of the brahmin Aggidatta, chaplain of Khemankara, king of Khemavatí, and Visákhá.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in the Khema pleasaunce, and lived for four thousand years in the household in three palaces - Ruci, Suruci and Vaddhana (or Rativaddhana).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife was Virocamáná (or Rocaní), and he had a son, Uttara.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left the world riding in a chariot, and practised austerities for only eight months.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his Enlightenment, he was given a meal of milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Vajirindha of the village Sucirindha, and grass for his seat by the yavapálaka Subhadda.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bodhi was a Sirísa-tree, and his first sermon was preached to eighty-four thousand monks in the park near the city of Makila.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He performed the Twin-Miracle under a Sála-tree at the gates of Kannakujja. Among his converts was a fierce yakkha named Naradeva.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He held only one assembly of his monks. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kakusandha's body was forty cubits in height, and he died at the age of forty thousand years in the Khema pleasaunce. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thúpa erected over his relics was one league high.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was at that time a king named Khema. The Buddha's chief disciples were Vidhura and Sañjíva among monks, </data>
<data>and Sama and Campá among nuns. His personal attendant was Buddhija. Accuta and Samana, Nandá and Sunandá were his most eminent lay-supporters (D.ii.7; Bu.xxiii; J.i.42; BuA.209ff). Kakusandha kept the fast-day (uposatha) every year (DhA.iii.236). In Kakusandha's time a Mára, named Dúsí (a previous birth of Moggallána), gave a great deal of trouble to the Buddha and his followers, trying greatly the Buddha's patience (M.i.333ff; Thag.1187). The Samyutta Nikáya (S.ii.190f) mentions that during the time of Kakusandha, the Mount Vepulla of Rájagaha was named Pácína-vamsa and the inhabitants were called Tivará.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monastery built by Accuta on the site where, in the present age, Anáthapindika erected the Jetavanáráma, was half a league in extent, and the ground was bought by golden kacchapas sufficient in number to cover it (J.i.94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ceylonese chronicles (Dpv.ii.66; xv.25, 34; xvii.9, 16, etc.; Mhv.xv.57-90), Kakusandha paid a visit to Ceylon. The island was then known as Ojadípa and its capital was Abhayanagara, where reigned King Abhaya. The Mahámeghavana was called Mahátittha. The Buddha came, with forty thousand disciples, to rid the island of a pestilence caused by yakkhas and stood on the Devakúta mountain from where, by virtue of his own desire, all inhabitants of the country could see him. The Buddha and his disciples were invited to a meal by the king, and after the meal the Mahátittha garden was presented to the Order; there the Buddha sat, in meditation, in order to consecrate various spots connected with the religion. At the Buddha's wish, the nun Rucánandá brought to the island a branch of the sacred bodhi-tree. The Buddha gave to the people his own drinking-vessel as an object of worship, and returned to Jambudípa, leaving behind his disciples Mahádeva and Rucánandá to </data>
<data>look after the spiritual welfare of the new converts to the faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Buddhist Sanskrit texts the name of the Buddha is given as Krakucchanda (See especially Divy.254, 418f; Mtu.iii.247, 330).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kakusandha Thera.-Author of the Sinhalese Dhátuvamsa, probably a translation from the Páli. He is generally assigned to the fifteenth century. P.L.C.255.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the end the farmer camouflaged himself like a tree, but the bird laughed in his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk, a fellow-celibate of Sáriputta. This monk was very careful about his body, and earned the reputation of a dandy. The bird is identified with the monk (J.ii.161f). This story bears some resemblance to the second Sakuntaka Játaka in the Mahávastu, particularly to the latter part of it. v.l.

A certain &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/garudaa')"&gt;Garuda&lt;/a&gt; king came disguised as a man and played at dice with the king. Having fallen in love with Kákátí, the Garuda carried her off to his abode by the Simbalí-Lake and there lived with her. The king, missing his queen, sent his physician, Natakuvera, to look for her. The physician hid himself in the Garuda's plumage and thus reached the palace where Kákátí was. There he enjoyed her favour and returned to Benares in the Garuda's wing. While the Garuda and the king were playing at dice, Natakuvera sang a song telling of his experiences with Kákátí. The Garuda, realising what had happened, brought the queen back to Benares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related by the Buddha to a monk who was discontented on account of a woman. The monk is identified with Natakuvera (J.iii.90-2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is among those related by the bird Kunála, in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kunaala_jat_536')"&gt;Kunála Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.

On its bank was a mango-grove where the Buddha rested awhile on a robe spread for him by Cundaka; there he reassured Cunda, telling him that no blame attached to him for having provided the Buddha with the meal which was to be his last (D.ii.129,134f; Ud.viii.5; UdA.402f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DA.ii.571) that when the Buddha bathed in the river, its banks and all the fishes it contained became golden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha pointed out to him that the difficult thing had been and was being accomplished (S.i.48).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.i.83) explains that Kámada had been a yogávacara on earth, but had died before he could attain to any Fruits of the Path and that here he laments his disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kadamba, Kadambaka.-The river that flows past Anurádhapura, on the eastern side, now called the Malvatu Oya (Mhv.vii.43; and Trs.58, n.3). Near the river was the Nivatta-cetiya (Mhv.xv.10). The river ford, the Gangalatittha (MT.361), formed the beginning of the boundary line of the símá of the Mahávihára, and this line also ended at the river bank (Mhv.xv.191). The road from Anurádhapura to Cetiyagiri lay across the Kadamba-nadí, and pious kings, such as Mahá-Dáthika-Mahá-Nága, spread carpets from the river up to the mountain so that pilgrims could wash their feet in the river and approach the mountain shrines with clean feet (Mhv.xxxiv.78).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road from the Kadamba river to Thúpáráma passed through the Rájamátudvára (SA.i.173). Moggallána II. dammed up the river among the mountains and thus formed three tanks, the Pattapásánavápi, the Dhanavápi, and the Garítara (Cv.xli.61), and Udaya II. built a weir for the overflow of the river (Cv.li.130).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, the capital of Ceylon, Abhayanagara, lay to the east of Kadambanadí (Mhv.xv.59; Dpv.xv.39; xvii.12; see also Mbv.120, 134f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Kalamba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Carimálopa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A name given in the Sutta Sangaha (No. 57) to a Sutta of the Itivuttaka (Itv. p.18f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha says that if people knew as much as he did of the results of giving they would share even their last morsel of food with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cúlapanthaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eminent arahant, declared chief among monks skilled in creating forms by mind-power and in mental &quot;evolution&quot; (cittavivatta) (A.i.23). He was the younger son of the daughter of a rich merchant of Rájagaha, who developed intimacy with a slave and fled with him when her misconduct was discovered. She wished to return to her parents for the birth of her first child, but her husband always postponed the visit until, in the end, she started to go without his knowledge. He followed her, but the child was born by the wayside, and therefore they called him Panthaka. The same thing occurred at the birth of the second child, and he also received the name of Panthaka, he being Cúlapanthaka and his brother Mahápanthaka. When the boys grew up they were taken to Rájagaha, where their grandparents took charge of them. Mahápanthaka often accompanied his grandfather to hear the Buddha preach, and he yearned to become a monk. He easily obtained permission and entered the Order, in due course becoming an arahant. With the consent of his grandparents, he ordained Cúlapanthaka, but the latter proved to be a dullard, and in the course of four months was unable to learn a single stanza. It is said that in the time of Kassapa Buddha Cúlapanthaka was a clever monk, who once laughed to scorn a dull colleague who was trying to learn a passage by heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mahápanthaka discovered his brother's stupidity, he asked him to leave the Order (see DhA.iv.190f), but Cúlapanthaka so loved the Buddha's teaching that he did not wish to return to the lay-life. One day Jívaka Komárabhacca, wishing to give alms to the Buddha and the monks, asked Mahápanthaka, who was acting as steward, to collect all the monks in the monastery. This he did, omitting only Cúlapanthaka who, he said, </data>
<data>had made no progress in the Doctrine. Greatly grieved, Cúlapanthaka determined to leave the Order, but as he was going out the Buddha met him, took him into the Gandhakuti and comforted him, giving him a clean piece of cloth. &quot;Sit with your face to the East,&quot; said the Buddha, &quot;repeat the words 'rajoha-ranam' and wipe your face with the cloth.&quot; As Cúlapanthaka carried out these orders he noticed that the cloth became dirty, and as he concentrated his mind on the impermanence of all things, the Buddha sent a ray of light and exhorted him about the necessity of getting rid of the impurities of lust and other evils. At the end of the admonition Cúlapanthaka attained arahantship with the four patisambhidá, which included knowledge of all the Pitakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tradition has it that Cúlapanthaka was once a king and that while going in procession round his city he wiped the sweat from his brow with a spotless garment which he wore and noticed how the cloth was stained. His mind then grasped the idea of impermanence, hence the ease with which he did so in his last birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Buddha and the monks were seated in Jívaka's house, but when the meal was about to be served the Buddha ordered it to be stopped, saying that there were other monks left in the monastery. A servant was sent to find them, and Cúlapanthaka, aware of this, contrived that the whole grove appeared full of monks engaged in various activities. When the messenger reported this, he was told to discover which of the monks was Cúlapanthaka and to bring him. But all the monks answered to this name, and the messenger was forced to return without him. &quot;Take by the hand the first who says that he is Cúlapanthaka,&quot; ordered the Buddha; and when this was done the other figures vanished. At the conclusion of the meal, Cúlapanthaka was </data>
<data>asked to return thanks, and &quot;like a young lion roaring defiance&quot; the Elder ranged over the whole of the Pitakas in his sermon. Thenceforth his fame spread, and the Buddha, in order to prove how in previous births also Cúlapanthaka had profited by advice received, related to the monks the Cullakasetthi Játaka (Thag.557-66; AA.i.119ff; J.i.114ff; DhA.i.239ff; ThagA.i.515ff; Vsm.388f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (i.250ff) gives another story of Cúlapanthaka's past. He went to Takkasilá to learn under a teacher, but though he did everything for his teacher he could learn nothing. The teacher, feeling sorry for him, taught him a charm: &quot;Ghattesi ghattesi, kim káraná ghattesi? áham pi tam jánámi&quot; (&quot;You try and try; what are you trying for? I know it too&quot;). When he had returned home thieves entered his house, but he woke up from his sleep and repeated the charm, whereupon the thieves fled, leaving behind them even their clothes. The king of Benares, wandering about the city in disguise, seeing what had happened, sent for Cúlapanthaka the next day and learnt from him the charm after paying him one thousand. Soon after-wards the king's commander-in-chief bribed the court barber to cut the king's throat, but while the barber was sharpening his razor the king repeated the charm. The barber, thinking that his intended crime was discovered, confessed his guilt. The king, realising that the youth had saved his life, appointed him commander-in-chief in place of the traitor, whom he banished. The youth was Cúlapanthaka and the teacher was the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cúlapanthaka was a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and having seen a monk exalted by the Buddha to the rank of chief among those skilled in creating mind-born forms, aspired to the same position. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk and practised </data>
<data>odátakasina for twenty thousand years (AA.i.119).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cúlapanthaka was expert in rúpajjhána and in samádhi, while his brother was skilled in arúpajjhána and in vipassaná. When creating forms, other monks could produce only two or three, while Cúlapanthaka could bring into being as many as one thousand at the same time, no two being alike in appearance or action (ThagA.i.490; PsA.276).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Apadána (i.58f), Cúlapanthaka joined the Order at the age of eighteen. It is said (Vin.iv.54f) that when it was his turn to teach the nuns at Sávatthi they expected no effective teaching, since he always repeated the same stanza. One day, at the end of the lesson, he overheard their remarks, and forthwith gave an exhibition of his magical powers and of his wide knowledge of the Buddha's teachings. The nuns listened with great admiration until after sunset, when they were unable to gain entrance to the city. The Buddha heard of this and warned Cúlapanthaka not to keep the nuns so late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Udána (v.10; UdA.319f) contains a verse sung by the Buddha in praise of Cúlapanthaka, and the Milinda (p.368) quotes a stanza attributed to Cúlapanthaka which has so far not been traced elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, while on his way to the palace, he saw a dead mouse lying on the road, and, noticing the position of the stars, he said, &quot;Any decent young fellow with his wits about him has only to pick up the mouse and he will be a made man.&quot; A young man of good family, called Cullantevásika, hearing this, picked up the mouse and sold it for a farthing to a tavern for their cat to eat. With the farthing he bought molasses and drinking water for flower-gatherers. Later, he gathered branches and leaves blown down by the wind in the king's garden and sold them to a potter for a large sum of money. He entered into friendship with a land-trader and a sea-trader and, by using the information he obtained from them, he was able to make two hundred thousand pieces by means of skilful and far-sighted business dealings. He then visited Cullasetthi to express to him his gratitude, and the setthi, on hearing of his skill, was so impressed that he gave him his daughter in marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young man is identified with Cullapanthaka (q.v.), in reference to whom the story was related. J.i.114-23. Cf. the story of Visákhila in Kathásaritságara (i.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was related in reference to the Buddha's visit to Verañjá, where, for the three months of the rainy season, he had to live on water and a modicum of the ground flour of roots, because of the evil influence of Mára.

One day, while they were disporting themselves near a  little stream, singing and dancing, the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, who had gone hunting, saw Candá and fell in love with her. So he shot Canda with an arrow, and when Candá lamented aloud at the sight of her dead husband the king revealed himself and offered her his love and his kingdom. Canda scorned the offer and protested to the gods that they should have allowed harm to befall her husband. Sakka's throne was heated by her such great loyalty and, coming in the guise of a brahmin, he restored to Canda his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king was Anuruddha and Candá was Ráhulamátá. The story was related by the Buddha when he visited his father's palace at Kapilavatthu and heard from Suddhodana how devotedly Ráhulamátá had continued to love the Buddha. He said it was not the first time that she had shown her undying affection. J.iv.282ff; DhA.i.97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Cúla Vagga.&lt;/b&gt;-The second of the two volumes known as the two Khandhakas of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vinaya_pitaka')"&gt;Vinaya Pitaka&lt;/a&gt;. The book consists of twelve chapters or Khandhakas, and brings the ecclesiastical history of the Buddhist Order down to the Second Council, one hundred years after the Buddha's death. In the Cúla Vagga are found several references to the Sutta Vibhanga, which leads us to the hypothesis that the latter work was regarded as an authoritative text at the time the Cúla Vagga was finished.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Candana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Candana.-A deva, vassal of the Four Regent Gods (D.ii.258). He is mentioned as one of the chief Yakkhas to be invoked by followers of the Buddha in case of need (D.iii.204). He once visited Lomasakangiya at the Nigrodháráma, questioned him regarding the True Saint, and recited to him stanzas learnt when the Buddha preached the Bhaddekaratta Sutta in Távatimsa (M.iii.199f) (but see below). The Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.53) records a conversation between Candana and the Buddha and a visit paid by Candana to Mahá Moggallána (S.iv.280). Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.951) says he was an upásaka in the time of Kassapa Buddha and offered the four requisites to the Buddha and the monks, as a result of which he became a deva. It is elsewhere stated that in Kassapa's time Candana and Lomasakangiya were friends and that both became monks. (ThagA.i.84f. In this version not Candana, but Lomasakangiya, expounds the Sutta; in M.iii.199f.it is Candana).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kassapa preached the Bhaddekaratta Sutta, Candana asked Lomasakangiya to explain it; this he was unable to do, and so made a wish that he should be able to explain it in a future birth, Candana wishing that he should then ask the questions again. Both wishes were fulfilled. For details see Lomasakangiya (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Candana Thera.-He belonged to a rich family in Sávatthi, and having heard the Buddha preach, became a sotápanna. When a son was born to him he joined the Order and took to meditating in the forest. Later he dwelt in a charnel-field near Sávatthi. There he was visited by his wife and child who hoped to win him back, but, seeing them from afar, he made a special effort and became an arahant, preaching to his wife as she approached (Thag.vs.299-302; ThagA.i.395f).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Thirty-one kappas ago he was a tree-sprite, and having seen the Pacceka Buddha Sudassana, gave him a kutaja-flower. He is probably identical with Kutajapupphiya Thera of the Apaddna. (ii.451; the same verses are also ascribed to Hárita).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Candana.-A monk of ninety-one kappas ago to whom Upáhanadáyaka made a gift of a pair of sandals. Ap.i.228.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cullasubhaddá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elephant, one of the two chief consorts of Chaddanta, against whom she conceived a grudge because he preferred her rival to her. She gave gifts to a Pacceka Buddha and, as a result of her wish, she was born as Subhaddá, chief queen of the Madda king. She gave orders that Chaddanta's tusks be brought to her, but the hunter to whom the task was entrusted killed the elephant, and on hearing of his death Subhaddá died of a broken heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For details see s.v.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Candimá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Candimá, Candimasa, Canda.&lt;/b&gt;-The name of the devaputta whose abode (vimána) is the moon (Canda), sometimes also called Candima. The moon is forty-nine leagues in diameter and appears in the world at the wish of the Ábhassara Brahmas, who are the first inhabitants of the earth, hence its name (amhákam chandam ñatvá viya utthito, tasmá cando hotú ti) (VibhA.519; PsA.253). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candimá is also included among the &lt;a href="caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Cátummahárájika&lt;/a&gt; devas because he lives in their world (E.g., Mahániddesa Cty. 108). There are other devas besides Canda who dwell in the moon (D.ii.269).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bilarikosiya_jat_450')"&gt;Bilárikosiya Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.63, 69), Sáriputta, having once given alms, was born as Canda, while in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sudhabhojana_jat_535')"&gt;Sudhábhojana Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.382, 412) it is Moggallána who was so born. The moon cannot move in the sky without the permission of Candimá, and he can stop its movement at will (E.g., DhA.ii.143, 146; iii.97). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that once, when Candimá was seized by Ráhu Asurinda, he invoked the Buddha in a verse and the Buddha asked Ráhu to set him at liberty, which request was granted (S.i.50). The deva Candimasa who is mentioned (S.i.51) as visiting the Buddha is probably identical with Candimá. The moon was worshipped when children were desired (E.g., J.iv.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sasa_jat_316')"&gt;Sasa Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (No.513) gives details of the story of how, as a result of the Bodhisatta's sacrifice when born as a hare, Sakka painted the figure of a hare on the moon, which sign will be seen throughout this kappa (J.i.172).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Candimá.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the descendants of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/o/okkaaka')"&gt;Okkáka&lt;/a&gt;. Mhv.ii.13; Dpv.iii.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cúla Gosinga Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, residing at the Giñjakávasatha in Nádiká, visits the Gosinga-Sálavana, where dwell Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila. (According to the Vinaya account (i.350), this incident takes place in Pácínavamsadáya). At first the keeper tries to stop the Buddha from approaching them, fearing lest he should disturb their meditation. The Buddha questions them as to their attainments and praises them. At the end of the sutta mention is made of a Yakkha, named Dígha, visiting the Buddha and telling him how the fame of the three Elders had travelled even to the world of Brahmá (M.i.205-11). The sutta illustrates the greatness of harmony (sámaggi). MA.i.361. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cariyápitaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fifteen books of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khuddaka_n')"&gt;Khuddaka Nikáya&lt;/a&gt;, generally placed last in the list. It contains tales in metrical verse of the Buddha's previous births, chiefly setting forth the ten&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/n_r/paramii')"&gt;páramí&lt;/a&gt;, by which he attained Enlightenment. Each story is called a Cariyá. The stories told here in verse are parallel to the corresponding Játaka stories in prose, and pre-suppose a familiar acquaintance with all the incidents of the prose tales. The first two páramí are illustrated by ten stories each, while the remaining páramí have only fifteen stories between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighabhaanakaa')"&gt;Dígha-bhánakas&lt;/a&gt; refused to include the Cariyápitaka in their canonical books, but it was accepted by the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/majjhimabhanaka')"&gt;Majjhima-bhánakas&lt;/a&gt; (DA.i.15, 23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There exists a Commentary on the Cariyápitaka which is ascribed to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala')"&gt;Dhammapála&lt;/a&gt; and which forms a part of the Paramathadípaní. (Published in the Hewavitarane Bequest Series, vol.xxvi.; 1929).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentary (CypA.1, 2), the Cariyápitaka was preached by the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigrodharama')"&gt;Nigrodháráma&lt;/a&gt;, after the conclusion of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhavamsa')"&gt;Buddhavamsa&lt;/a&gt; and at the request of  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was preached by Mahinda at the Nandanavana in Anurádhapura, soon after his arrival in Ceylon (Dpv.xiv.45; but see Mhv.xv.179).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Mágha and his companions erected a hall, and Cittá had a flower garden laid out close by wherein she grew every kind of flowering tree, shrub and creeper. As a result she was reborn in Távatimsa as Sakka's consort, and the Cittalatávana came into being for her pleasure. DhA.i.269f; J.i.201f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cittá.-A Therí.

In her old age she went to Gijjhakúta and there, after meditation, she attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety-four kappas ago she was a kinnará on the bank of the Canda-bhágá and there offered flowers to a Pacceka Buddha (Thig.vs.27f.; ThigA.33f).

Cetovimuttiphala Sutta.-When a monk perceives the foulness of the body, is conscious of the cloying of food, feels distaste for the world, perceives impermanence in all compounded things, and has the thought of death inwardly established in him, there come to him mind-emancipation and emancipation by way of insight and he becomes completely free.

Ninety-one kappas ago a Pacceka Buddha, named Ananda, died in the forest and the Thera, who was then a deva, descended from the deva-world and burned the Pacceka Buddha's body on a pyre (Ap.i.227).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Citakapújaka Thera.-An arahant. In the time of Sikhí Buddha he was a tree-sprite on a rájáyatana-tree. At the Buddha's death he made offerings of flowers and music and perfume at the Buddha's funeral pyre. Thirty-one kappas ago, he became king sixteen times, under the name of Uggata (Ap.i.151).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Citakapújaka Thera.-An arahant. Ninety-four kappas ago, while wandering along the Candabhágá River, he saw the Buddha's funeral pyre and made offering to it of seven máluvá-flowers. Seventy-seven kappas ago he became king seven times, under the name of Patijagga (Ap.i.237).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Citakapújaka Thera.-An arahant. He offered sála-flowers at the pyre of a Pacceka Buddha named Jalajuttama, one hundred thousand kappas ago (Ap.i.292f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha explains to the assembled monks the six &quot;sixes&quot; - e.g., the six internal senses (hearing etc.), the six external sense-objects (form etc.), the six groups of perceptions (sight and forms, hearing and sounds, etc.), and the six groups of cravings (M.iii.280ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (MA.ii.1024f) says that, apart from the sixty monks who became arahants when the Buddha first preached the sutta, on each occasion of its preaching, by the Chief Disciples and by the eighty chief disciples, a like number attained arahantship. In Ceylon, Maliyadeva Thera preached it at sixty different places, and each time sixty monks became arahants. Once, when Tipitaka-Cúlanága preached it at the Ambilahálavihára, one thousand monks attained to arahantship (MA.ii.1025).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day some of his flock came upon Lake Mánusiya, near the haunts of men, and finding it a rich feeding-ground, persuaded him much against his will to go there with them. But immediately he alighted he was caught in a fowler's noose and found escape impossible. He waited till the flock had fed, then gave the cry of alarm at which all the geese flew away except his commander-in-chief, Sumukha. When the fowler came, Sumukha offered to give his life for his king, and thereby softened the fowler's heart. The latter set Dhatarattha free and tended his wounds, and because of the man's great charity the king of the geese became whole again. When the fowler suggested that they should fly home, the two geese insisted that they should be taken to Sakula, the king of the land, the Mahimsaka country, that they might obtain for the fowler a suitable reward. When the king heard the story he gave to the fowler a village yielding one hundred thousand annually, a chariot and a large store of gold. Dhatarattha preached to the king the moral law and, after being paid great honour, returned to Cittakúta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Ananda's attempt to offer his life in order to save the Buddha from being killed by the elephant Nálágiri (q.v.). Channa is identified with the fowler, Sáriputta with the king, and Ananda with Sumukha. J.v.333-.54; DhA.i.119; cf. the Maháhamsa Játaka and the Hamsa Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Canndálatissa-mahábhaya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.52), there was once a period of great disaster in Ceylon, known as the Canndála-tissabhaya. There was no food to be had, and Sakka provided the monks with a raft on which to cross the sea. Sixty monks, however, remained in Ceylon, guarding the scriptures. Twelve years later, when the danger was past, the monks who had left the land returned and dwelt in the Mandaláráma in Kallagáma (Kálakagáma?). There the two parties of monks met and, on comparing their records of the scriptures, these were found not to differ by so much as a syllable or even a single letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison of this story with the account given elsewhere (E.g., VibhA.445ff) of the Bráhmanatissacorabhaya strongly suggests that both refer to the same account.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cakkaratana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the seven treasures of a &lt;a href="cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakkavatti&lt;/a&gt;. When a Cakkavatti is born into the world, the Cakkaratana appears before him from the Cakkadaha, travelling through the air (J.iv.232, but see Vepulla). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cakkaratana is the Cakkavatti's chief symbol of office; on its appearance before him, he sprinkles it with water and asks it to travel to the various quarters of the world, winning them for him. This the Cakkaratana does, carrying with it through the air the Cakkavatti with his fourfold army. Wherever the Cakkaratana halts, all the chiefs of that quarter acclaim the Cakkavatti as their overlord and declare their allegiance to him. Having thus traversed the four quarters of the earth, it returns to the Cakkavatti's capital, and remains fixed as an ornament on the open terrace in front of his inner apartments (D.ii.173f; M.iii.173ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.617ff; MA.ii.942ff) contain lengthy descriptions of the Cakkaratana: it is shaped like a wheel, its nave is of sapphire, the centre of which shines like the orb of the moon, and round it is a band of silver. It has one thousand spokes, each ornamented with various decorations; its tyre is of bright coral; within every tenth spoke is a coral staff, hollow inside, which produces the sounds of the fivefold musical instruments when blown upon by the wind. On the staff is a white parasol, on either side of which are festoons of flowers. When the wheel moves, it appears like three wheels moving one within the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Cakkavatti dies or leaves the world, the Cakkaratana disappears from the sight of men for seven days; it gives warning of a Cakkavatti's impending death by slipping from its place some time </data>
<data>before the event (D.iii.59f.; MA.ii.885). When his successor has lived righteously for seven days, it reappears (D.iii.64).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the most precious and the most honoured thing in the world. UdA.356.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He came to see the Buddha at Jetavana and asked him why some people earned the reputation of being wrathful and others of being kindly. The Buddha explained that the one man gives way to passion, resentment and illusion; therefore, others harass him; he shows vexation and comes to be called wrathful. The other shows opposite qualities and is called kindly (súrata) (S.iv.305). The Commentary says (SA.iii.99) that the name Canda was given to the gámani by the Elders who compiled the texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

It is a continuation of the Mahávamsa, but, unlike the latter, is not a homogeneous work in that it was written by different authors at different periods. It is generally agreed that chapters thirty-seven to seventy-nine were written by the Thera Dhammakitti in the thirteenth century. The second section, beginning with the reign of Vijayabáhu II. and ending with that of Parakkamabáhu of Hatthiselapura (Chaps.80-90), seems to be the work of one author whose identity, however, remains unknown. That part of the chronicle which deals with the period from Parakkamabáhu to A.C.1758, the death of Kittisiri Rájasíha, was compiled by Tibbotuváve Sumangala Thera, and the last chapter has been continued down to 1815 by Hikkaduve Siri Sumangala.

His parents married him to a suitable wife but, because they had both come from the Brahma-world, they were free from passionate desire. After his parents' death, the two distributed their wealth and became ascetics. One day they came to the king's park, and there the king fell in love with the woman and carried her away by force to the palace. When he told the Bodhisatta of this, he showed no resentment whatever. In the palace the king found that he could not win the woman's love, and returned to the park, curious to know whether the ascetic really meant what he said. In the course of conversation the Bodhisatta told the king that he did not give way to anger because anger, once awakened, is difficult to curb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk of violent temper. The king was Ananda and the Bodhisatta's wife was Ráhulamátá. (J.iv.22-27.

The geese replied that not food but character made people comely; the crow was too greedy ever to be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a greedy monk who went from house to house in search of dainty food, frequenting the dwellings of the rich.

Citta (called Cittagahapati).&lt;/b&gt;-A householder of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/macchikaasanda')"&gt;Macchikásanda&lt;/a&gt;, where he was Treasurer. He was later declared by the Buddha to be pre-eminent among laymen who preached the Doctrine (A.i.26). On the day of his birth the whole city was covered knee-deep with flowers of various hues, hence his name.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mahánáma visited Macchikásanda, Citta, pleased with his demeanour, invited him to his park, the Ambátakáráma, and built for him a monastery there. And there the Elder preached to Citta the Salá-yatana-vibhatti and Citta became an Anágámí. Thereafter many monks visited the Ambátakáráma and accepted Citta's hospitality. Among them was Isidatta (q.v.), a former acquaintance of Citta, but Isidatta left when he found that his identity had been discovered. Mahánáma and Mahaka did likewise, after having performed miracles at the request of Citta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Citta Samyutta (S.iv.282ff) contains a record of conversations between Citta and members of the Order, among whom, besides those already mentioned, were Kámabhú and Godatta. Citta is also said to have had discussions with Nigantha Nátaputta and Acela Kassapa and to have refuted their views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera named Sudhamma was a permanent resident in the Ambátakáráma and was looked after by Citta. Once, when the two Chief Disciples and several other eminent Elders came to the Ambátakáráma, Citta invited first these and then Sudhamma; the latter, feeling slighted, blamed Citta beyond measure, but the Buddha, hearing of this, sent Sudhamma to ask for Citta's pardon (Vin.ii.15ff; DhA.ii.74f; for details see Sudhamma).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some time later, Citta visited the Buddha. He was accompanied by two thousand others and took with him five hundred </data>
<data>cartloads of offerings to the Buddha and the Order. As he fell at the feet of the Buddha, flowers of five hues showered from the sky and the Buddha preached to him the Saláyatana-vibhatti. For a fortnight he continued distributing his gifts to the Order and the devas filled his carts with all kinds of valuables (AA.i.210).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Citta lay ill just before his death, devas visited him and advised him to wish for kingship among them, but he refused to aspire to anything so impermanent, and instructed the devas and his kinsfolk gathered round him, telling them of the Buddha and his teachings (S.iv.302f). He is regarded as the ideal layman (E.g., at A.i.88; ii.164; iii.451).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He owned a tributary village called Migapattaka (SA.iii.93).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Citta conceived his desire to be placed first among laymen in the teaching of the Dhamma. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a huntsman. One day, seeing a monk in a glen, and being pleased thereat, he hurried home, prepared a meal and brought it to the monk, together with flowers he had gathered on the way. After the offering, he made a wish that he should never lack for tribute and that showers of flowers should fall on him. In the deva-world he surpassed all others in his great beauty (AA.i.209). In the Bhisa Játaka (J.iii.314), he is identified with the slave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Citta was not an arahant, he possessed the patisambhidá of a probationer (sekha). Vsm.442.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Citta.&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta born as a Candála. For details see the &lt;a href="citta_sambhuuta_jat_498')"&gt;Citta-Sambhuta Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Citta, Cittaka.&lt;/b&gt;-A deer, brother of Rohanta, the Bodhisatta. He is identified with Ananda. For details see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rohantamiga_jat_501')"&gt;Rohantamiga Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Citta called Hatthirohaputta (Hatthisáriputta)&lt;/b&gt;.-A thera, son of an elephant trainer, who, having entered the Order, studied under the Buddha and gained special proficiency in distinguishing subtle differences in the meanings of words. Six times he left the Order and six times returned. His last quarrel was with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kotthita')"&gt;Mahá Kotthita&lt;/a&gt;, who objected to his constant interruptions of the Elder's discussions regarding the Abhidhamma. (This incident is recorded at A.iii.392ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DA.ii.378f.; AA.ii.688) that in the time of Kassapa Buddha, Citta and a friend entered the Order. When the friend expressed a desire to return to household life, Citta encouraged him to do so, coveting his belongings. This was the reason for Citta's inability to remain in the Order. He was a friend of Potthapáda, and when he had returned for the sixth time to a householder's life, Potthapáda brought him to the Buddha. Citta listened to their conversation and asked questions regarding personality. At the end of the discourse (recounted in the Potthapáda Sutta) Citta once more joined the Order, never again to leave it, for he soon after became an arahant (D.i.199ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuddaala_jat_70')"&gt;Kuddála Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.311f) gives the circumstances in which he first joined the Order. He was a youth of good family at Sávatthi. One day, while on his way home from ploughing, he received from the bowl of a certain Elder some rich and dainty food. In order to gain similar food for himself, he became a monk, but soon after, lust overcame him and he left the homeless life. Even after he became an arahant his colleagues are said to have taunted him, asking when he would be leaving them, and it was only when the Buddha told them that such a time would never be were they satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The same story, except for certain details, is also found in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.305ff), but there Citta is called Cittahattha, and a different explanation is given of his name: esa cittavasiko hutvá vicarati ti Cittahatthan ti námam karimsu. It is further stated that on the last occasion of his leaving home he saw his pregnant wife lying asleep and was so filled with, revolt that he returned to the Order. He started forth at once, a yellow robe tied round his waist, and as he walked to the vihára, he became a sotápanna. The monks were at first reluctant to re-ordain him, but his importunity was so great that they relented, and in a few days he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Citta.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the chief lay supporters of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaata')"&gt;Sujáta&lt;/a&gt; Buddha. Bu.xiii.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Citta.&lt;/b&gt;-A Thera of Ceylon. King Mahádáthika Mahá-nága had a young and beautiful queen, named Damiladeví. One day, when she was worshipping at the Ambatthala at Cetiyagiri, Citta, who had joined the Order in his old age, fell in love with her and behaved as one mad, constantly repeating to himself &quot;beautiful as Damiladeví.&quot; Even when told of her death, which took place soon after, he refused to believe the news and continued as before; he became, therefore, known as Ummattaka Citta. AA.i.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Citta.&lt;/b&gt;-A herdsman, servant of Díghagámani. He was put to death by the brothers of Ummáda-Cittá, because he refused to promise to kill Ummáda-Cittá's child should it be a boy. He was reborn as a yakkha. See Cittarája. Mhv.ix.22f.; MT.278.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Citta&lt;/b&gt;.-A minister, spoken of as Cittamahámatta. He was very generous and kept in his house a gong, by sounding which monks could obtain the requisites at any time. Each day he spent </data>
<data>sixty kahápanas for the supply of medicines alone. VibhA.341.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Citta&lt;/b&gt;.-A city where &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mangala')"&gt;Mangala&lt;/a&gt; Buddha performed his Twin Miracle. BuA.119.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cívara Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when Mahá Kassapa was at Veluvana in Rájagaha, Ananda returned from a tour in the Dakkhinágiri, with thirty monks, mostly youths. They were ill-behaved, and Kassapa blamed Ananda for going about with them, calling him &quot;corn-tramper,&quot; &quot;despoiler of families,&quot; and, finally, &quot;a boy.&quot; Ananda gently reminded him that being grey-haired he could hardly be called a boy, but Kassapa refused to listen. Thulla-Nandá, hearing of this, vented her displeasure on Kassapa by reminding him that he was once a heretical teacher. Kassapa there-upon remonstrated with Ananda, pointing out that he was a very devoted follower and pupil of the Buddha and relating how, on one occasion, the Buddha accepted from him the gift of his soft robe, giving him, in return, the Buddha's rag-robe. Well might he, he said, claim to be a real son of the Buddha. S.1217ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha replies that it is because of certain undiscarded states of consciousness, which can be got rid of through renunciation. He proceeds to describe how he, too, failed to find satisfaction before his Enlightenment. He then tells of a conversation he once had on Gijjhakúta with some Niganthas, who believed that suffering could be got rid of through austerities and how he told them of his happiness which was far greater even than that of Bimbisára, king of Magadha.

Cunda Sutta.-Cunda Kammáraputta visits the Buddha in his Mango-grove in Pává and questions him as to how many classes of recluses there are in the world. Four, answers the Buddha - maggajina, maggadesaka, maggajíví and maggadúsí - and proceeds to explain them (SN.vs.83-90; SNA.i.159ff). The circumstances in which the sutta was preached are given s.v. Cunda (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cunda Sutta (also called Mahá Cunda Sutta).-Preached by Mahá Cunda at Sahajátí to the assembled monks. Some, who are zealous about the Dhamma, speak disparagingly of those who are given to jhána and vice versa. Sometimes it happens that those who are engaged in the Dhamma praise their fellows, and similarly with those devoted to jhána. None of these things are profitable. Dhamma-zealots should learn to praise those eager for jhána and vice versa (A.iii.355f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Cunda Sutta.-Mahá Cunda tells the monks at Sahajátí how it is possible to distinguish true statements from false when made by a monk about himself and his attainments (A.v.41ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Cunda Sutta.-Cunda Samanuddesa comes to Jetavana from Nálagámaka, where he had attended Sáriputta during his last illness, and reports his death to Ananda, producing, at the same time, Sáriputta's bowl and outer robe and the water-strainer containing his relies. Ananda accompanies Cunda to the Buddha, where he breaks the news. The Buddha praises Sáriputta's attainments and takes the opportunity of emphasising the impermanence of all things.

He heard the Buddha preach at Veluvana and, having entered the Order, practised meditation in a wooded spot, ultimately achieving arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he offered him flowers in homage (Thag.22; ThagA.i.77).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Tínikinkinipupphiya Thera of the Apadána.

He was a brahmin who entered the Order at the age of five, becoming an arahant in the tonsure-ball. In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was an ascetic who had renounced great wealth. Having met the Buddha, he offered him a seat and gave him mangoes, sandalwood and sála-flowers. He was once king of the city of Vebhára (Ap.ii.423f). He is probably identical with Valliya Thera.

It was related in reference to a nun of Sávatthi who, while listening one day to a sermon by the Buddha, admired his extreme beauty of form and wondered if she had ever been his wife. Immediately the memory of her life as Cullasubhaddá, Chaddanta's consort, came to her mind and she laughed for joy; but on further recollecting that she had been the instrument of his death, she wept aloud. The Buddha related this story in explanation of her conduct. J.v.36; Speyer (ZDMG.lxxv.2, 305ff) suggests an allegorical explanation of the Chaddanta Játaka. Feer (JA.1895 v.) gives a careful study of the story based on a comparison of five different Versions - two Páli, two Chinese and one Sanskrit. This Játaka forms the theme of many illustrations - e.g., in Barhut (Cunningham, pl.xxxvi.6), also Ajanta Caves x. and xvii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It came into being through the good deeds performed by Mágha's wife, Cittá (DhA.i.271-5; J.i.202). It is said (VvA.94) that the place was so called not only because of its association with Cittá, but also because there grew in it various creepers bearing many coloured flowers. In the pleasaunce is born the Ásávatí creeper which blossoms only once in a thousand years. ThagA.i.365; J.iii.250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

It was once the residence of the Yakkha Cápála, but, later, a vihára was erected on the site for the use of the Buddha (UdA.322f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fa Hsien found a pagoda there and relates a story in connection with it (p.43).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He reported this to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, who remarked that those who penetrate the meaning of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/b_f/dukkha')"&gt;dukkha&lt;/a&gt;, etc., do a far more difficult thing (S.v.453f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Chiggala Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-It is more probable that a blind turtle, rising to the surface only once in a hundred years, should put his neck through a yoke (chiggala) with a single hole, floating about in the ocean, than that a fool who has gone to the Downfall should become a man again (S.v.455; cp. M.iii.169; Thig.500).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Chiggala Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Similar to 2.

Ceti, Cetiya.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the sixteen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada')"&gt;Mahájanapadas&lt;/a&gt; (A.i.213, etc.), probably identical with Cedi of the older documents (E.g., Rv.viii.5, 37-9). The people of Ceti seem to have had two distinct settlements: one, perhaps the older, was in the mountains, probably the present Nepal (Bud. India, p.26). It is evidently this older settlement which is mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara_jat_547')"&gt;Vessantara Játaka&lt;/a&gt;; it was passed by Vessantara on his way into exile in the Himalayas, and was thirty yojanas distant from Jetuttara (J.vi.514, 518). The other, probably a later colony, lay near the Yamuná, to the east, in the neighbourhood of and contiguous to the settlement of the Kurus; for we are told (Vin.iv.108f; J.i.360f) that the Buddha, having dwelt in the Ceti country, went to Bhaddavatiká, where, at the Ambatittha, Ságata tamed a Nága, and from there he went to Kosambí. This part of the country corresponds roughly to the modern Bundelkhand and the adjoining region (Law: Geog. of Early Bsm., p.16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was probably of the older Ceti that Sotthivatí was the capital, where once reigned &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/apacara')"&gt;Apacara&lt;/a&gt;, who uttered the first lie in the world. (J.iii.454ff Sotthivati is probably identical with Suktimati or Sukti-Sáhvaya of the Mahábhárata (iii.20, 50; xiv.83, 2); see also PHAI.81).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; to Ceti lay through a forest which was infested by robbers (J.i.253, 256). The settlement of Ceti was an important centre of Buddhism, even in the time of the Buddha. The Anguttara Nikáya (A.iii.355f; v.41f; 157ff) mentions several discourses preached </data>
<data>to the Cetis, while the Buddha dwelt in their town of Sahajáti. While dwelling in the Pácínavamsadáya in the Ceti country, Anuruddha became an arahant after a visit which the Buddha paid to him (A.iv.228; see also Vin.i.300f). The Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.200 and passim) leads us to infer that the Buddha visited the Ceti country several times. The Samyutta Nikáya (S.v.436f) records a discussion on the four Ariyan Truths among a number of monks, including Gavampati, dwelling at Sahajáti (v.l. Sahañcanika).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (E.g., AA.ii.765) that the country was called Ceti because it was ruled by kings bearing the name of Ceti or Cetiya (SNA.i.135).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Cetiya.&lt;/b&gt;-A mythical king (Mhv.ii.3; Dpv.iii.5; Mtu.i.348).

It is not known who built the hall, but it was restored by Vasabha (Mhv.xxxv.88).

When the heretics of this Order found that their gains were grown less owing to the popularity of the Buddha, they enlisted the support of Ciñcá in their attempts to discredit him. She was very beautiful and full of cunning, and they persuaded her to pretend to pay visits to the Buddha at Jetavana. She let herself be seen going towards the vihára in the evening, spent the night in the heretics' quarters near by, and in the morning men saw her returning from the direction of the vihára. When questioned, she said that she had passed the night with the Buddha. After some months she simulated pregnancy by tying a disc of wood round her body and appearing thus before the Buddha, as he preached to a vast congregation, she charged him with irresponsibility and callousness in that he made no provision for her confinement. The Buddha remained silent, but Sakka's throne was heated and he caused a mouse to sever the cords of the wooden disc, which fell to the ground, cutting Ciñcá's toes. She was chased out of the vihára by those present, and as she stepped outside the gate the fires of the lowest hell swallowed her up (DhA.iii.178f; J.iv.187f; ItA.69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous birth, too, she had helped in various ways to harm the Bodhisatta.

A young brahmin, called Kápathika, frequently interrupts the conversation and is rebuked by the Buddha. Cankí tells the Buddha that the youth is a very clever scholar and obtains for him a chance of questioning the Buddha. The Buddha declares that the brahmin pretensions to possess the sole truth are vain, and goes on to explain how a man can come to have faith in truth, then gain enlightenment with regard to it, and finally attain the truth itself by means of practice and development. At the end of the discourse Kápathika declares himself a follower of the Buddha. M.ii.164ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cittalapabbata&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountain in Rohana on which Kákavanna-Tissa built a vihára (Mhv.xxii.23) and Vasabha ten thúpas (Mhv.xxxv.81). Dáthopatissa gave to the vihára the village of Gonnavitthi (CV.xlv.59). The mountain is described as being healthy (utusappáya) (MT.552), and sometimes there lived on it as many as twelve thousand monks (VibhA.445; Mhv.xxiv.9). Attached to the vihára was the Ninkaponnapadhánaghara (VibhA.489) and the Kotagerukapásáda - the residence of Bhágineyya Sangharakkhita (MT.552) - and also, probably, a nunnery. (See VibhA.498). The Elders Mahánága and Cúlanága lived at Cittalapabbata for three years (SA.ii.125). The Commentaries&quot; contain several stories connected with the mountain. (E.g., VibhA.264, 498; DhsA.351, 399; AA.i.386; MA.i.18, 66, 150, 223, 351, 399). Near by (AA.i.386) was the village of Kálumbara and the bathing place of Kuruvakatittha (MA.ii.1024). It was evidently a very important monastic centre in Ceylon, and is mentioned on a par with Abhayagiri and Cetiyapabbata (DA.ii.478). Cittalapabbata is sometimes called Cittalakúta. E.g., Mhv.xxxv.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His wife, being with child, yearned to eat a mango, and he went by night to the king's garden to try and get one. But day broke before he could escape and he remained perched in the tree. While he was there, the king came with his chaplain and, sitting on a high seat at the foot of the tree, learnt the Law from the chaplain, who occupied a low seat. The Bodhisatta climbed down from the tree and pointed out to them their error. The king, being very pleased, made him ruler of the city by night and placed round his neck the garland of red flowers which he himself was wearing. Hence the custom of the lords of the city to wear a wreath of red flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Chabbaggiya monks, who preached the Doctrine to those who sat on a higher seat than they themselves.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cátummahárájiká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inhabitants of the lowest (Cátummahárájika) deva world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This world derives its name from the Four Great Kings (&lt;b&gt;Cattáro Mahárájáno&lt;/b&gt;) who dwell there as guardians of the four quarters;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Dhatarattha of the East, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Virúlhaka of the South, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Virúpakkha of the West, and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vessarana of the North (D.ii.207f; iii.194f). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;They keep large retinues consisting, respectively, of Gandhabbas, Kumbhandas, Nágas and Yakkhas, all of whom dwell in the same world as their lords and accompany them on their travels. These kings are mentioned (D.ii.257f) as having undertaken the protection of the Buddha from the moment of his conception in his mother's womb, and in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aataanaatiya_s')"&gt;Átánátiya Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, they appear as protectors not only of the Buddha but also of his followers (See, e.g., DhA.ii.146; iii.96).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Four Kings appear to have been regarded as Recorders of the happenings in the assemblies of the devas (D.ii.225). On the eighth day of the lunar half-month, they send their councillors out into the world to discover if men cultivate righteousness and virtue; on the fourteenth day they send their sons, on the fifteenth day they themselves appear in the world, all these visits having the same purpose. Then, at the assembly of the devas, they submit their report to the gods of Távatimsa, who rejoice or lament according as to whether men prosper in righteousness or not (A.i.142f.; for more details see AA.i.376f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These four Gods surpass the other inhabitants of their worlds in ten ways - beauty, length of life, etc. - because their merit is greater than that of the </data>
<data>others (A.iv.242).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides these Regent Gods and their followers, other dwellers are to be found in their world - the Khiddápadosiká, the Manopadosiká, the Sitavaláhaká, the Unhavaláhaká, and the devaputtas Candima and Suriya (VibhA.519; MNidA.108).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life in the Cátummahárájiká world lasts, according to human computation, ninety thousand years (DA.ii.472, 647, but see Kvu.207). Beings are born there as a result of various acts of piety and faith which, however, are based on motives not very exalted (A.iv.60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cátummahárájiká world is situated half-way up Mount Sineru. Some of the devas of the world dwell in the mountain, others in the sky. (On these gods see Moulton: Zoroastrianism 22-7, 242.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He had six brothers. The king, becoming suspicious of his sons, ordered them to leave the kingdom. They went away with their wives, and coming to a region where no food was to be had, they killed their wives one by one and ate their flesh.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta managed to save his wife by foregoing a share of the meal each day, and fled with her. During the flight the Bodhisatta gave his wife some of his blood to drink, she being so thirsty. Later they lived in a hut on the bank of the Ganges. One day the Bodhisatta rescued from the river a thief with his limbs cut off who was drifting down stream in a boat. At first the Bodhisatta's wife would not even look at the man, but soon she conceived a passion for him and threw her husband down a precipice. The Bodhisatta fell on a fig-tree, and after some time climbed down with the help of an iguana. He went to Benares and established his claim to his father's kingdom. His erstwhile wife, wandering from place to place with the cripple on her shoulders, gained great reputation as a devoted wife. One day she came to Benares. There the king recognised her and revealed her treachery (J.ii.115-21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a backsliding monk.

Two brahmins of Pátaliputta, having heard of the fame of Mahánága Thera of Kálavallimandapa, set out to see him. One died on the way; the other went to Anurádhapura and, hearing there that the Thera resided in Rohana, journeyed there and took up his abode in Cúlanagaragáma, near the vihára.

He evidently understood medicine, and one day he administered medical treatment for a sick person, in return for which he received a portion of choice food. As he went out he met an Elder on the road to whom he offered it, telling him the circumstances in which it was obtained and offering to bring him in the future the food so obtained. The Elder listened, then walked away without a word. When the Buddha heard of this, he declared that a shameless man can, in a manner of speaking, live happily, like a crow.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cakkhupála Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He was the son of a landowner, Mahá Suvanna of Sávatthi, and was called Mahá-Pála (major Pála), his brother being Culla-Pála. The boys were called Pála on account of being born through the favour of a tree deity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahá-Pála heard the Buddha preach at Jetavana and entered the Order. After five years of novitiate he went with sixty others to a woodland spot to meditate. There he fell a victim to ophthalmia and was prescribed for by a doctor; but he neglected his eyes, devoting his whole time to the duties of recluse ship. He became an arahant but lost the sight of his eyes, hence his name. Later, Cakkhupála's colleagues returned to Sávatthi and, at his own request, Cakkhupála's brother sent his nephew Pálita, ordained as a monk, to fetch him. On the way through the forest, Pálita was attracted by the song of a woodcutter's wife and, bidding his uncle wait, went and sinned with her. When Cakkhupála, by questioning the novice, learnt of this, he refused to be accompanied by him, even though he should die on the way. Sakka's throne was heated, and he led the Elder safely to Sávatthi, where he was looked after by his brother to the end of his days (Thag.95; ThagA.i.195f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that in a previous birth he had been a physician, and because a woman, whose disease of the eye he had cured, tried to cheat him out of his promised reward, he gave her a drug which completely ruined her eyes. DhA.i.15ff, where several details are given regarding Cakkhupála which are not mentioned here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Cúla-Kála.&lt;/b&gt;-The youngest of three brothers, named Kála, house-holders of Setavyá. He accompanied Mahá-Kála to Sávatthi with a caravan, and when Mahá-Kála entered the Order he joined him. Later, as they were returning to Setavyá, this time with the Buddha and the monks, he was sent on ahead to arrange seats in his former house, whither the Buddha and the monks had been invited. His two erstwhile wives mocked at him and persuaded him to return to the lay-life. DhA.i.55ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Cúla-Kála.&lt;/b&gt;-A previous birth of Aññá-Kondañña. He was a house-holder of Hamsavatí, in the time of Vipassí Buddha. One day going to the rice-field, he hulled a kernel of rice, ate it and found it unusually sweet. He thereupon obtained his share of the field from his brother Mahá-Kála, and gave to the Buddha and the monks the first-fruits of a single crop, nine times, at nine different stages (DhA.i.82). He thus became the first to gain any attainment when Gotama Buddha preached his first sermon (DhA.i.8ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Cúla-Kála.&lt;/b&gt;-A lay disciple of the Buddha. He was once on his way back to Sávatthi, having spent the night in listening to the Doctrine, when thieves, fleeing from their pursuers, threw their stolen goods in front of him and disappeared. When he was charged with theft, some women water-carriers, who had witnessed the incident on their way to the watering place, obtained his release. DhA.iii.157.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He studied under Pokkharasáti at Ukkatthá and, having finished his course; returned home for money wherewith to pay his teacher. On the way back to Setavyá he was met by the Buddha, who taught him three stanzas, on the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and made him take the five precepts. As he proceeded along his road, Chatta was attacked by robbers and killed. He was reborn in Távatimsa, and when all his relations, his teacher and others were assembled for his funeral ceremony, he came into their midst, conveyed by his thirty-league vimána, and made obeisance to the Buddha who was present, and declared to him his great indebtedness for his compassion. The Buddha preached to the assembled multitude, and Chatta and his parents became Sotápannas. Vv.v.3; VvA.229ff; the story is often quoted - e.g., Sp.i.172; MA.i.256; and the stanzas taught by the Buddha, as mentioned above, have become famous - e.g., DA.i.230; MA.i.107; AA.i.303.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.

He then went with the Buddha to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;. On the festival day his parents made great lamentation and a slave girl offered to entice him back.

She gradually made his acquaintance, and then, feigning illness, enticed him into her apartments. Then, having violated his chastity, she took him back to Rájagaha (J.i.156f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, hearing of this, preached the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaatamiga_jat_014')"&gt;Vátamiga Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, in which story Tissa is identified with the antelope.

She visited the Buddha at the Kalandakanivápa in Veluvana, and he preached to her the Cundí Sutta (A.iii.35f). According to the Commentary (AA.ii.596), she was the daughter of Bimbisára. The king gave her five hundred chariots for the use of herself and her companions. She was one of the three women who received this gift from their fathers, the others being Visákhá and the princess Sumaná. Cundí's brother was Cunda. Her name occurs in a list of eminent upásikás. A.iv.347.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cundí Sutta.-Cundí visits the Buddha and tells him that, according to her brother, Cunda, those who take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Order and refrain from the taking of life, from theft, carnal lusts, lying and liquor, will be born in a happy condition after death. She wishes to know more of this. The Buddha explains to her that the Tathágata is the best of beings, the Doctrine which leads to Nibbána is the best of teachings, the Tathágata's Order is the best field of merit, and of virtues, those beloved by Ariyans are the best.

His teacher gave him his daughter in marriage and he became known as &lt;a href="culla_dhanuggaha')"&gt;Culla-Dhanuggaha&lt;/a&gt;. When on his way with his wife to Benares, he killed a fierce elephant, and then meeting fifty bandits, slew all except the leader. He seized the leader and hurling him to the ground asked his wife for his sword. But his wife, conceiving a passion for the bandit, placed the sword's hilt in the bandit's hand, and he straightway slew Culla-Dhanuggaha. While walking away with the woman, the bandit, reflecting on her treacherousness, decided to leave her. When they came to a river he left her on the bank, and taking her ornaments across the river on the pretence of keeping them safe he deserted her. The Bodhisatta, born as Sakka, observing this and wishing to shame the woman, appeared before her as a jackal, with Mátali as a fish and Pañcasikha as a bird. The jackal had a piece of flesh in his mouth, but when the fish leapt up he abandoned it to catch the fish, only to find the bird flying away with it. The woman saw and understood. The story was told in reference to a monk who wished to leave the Order because of his former wife. The monk is identified with Culla-Dhanuggaha and his wife with the woman of the story (J.iii.219-24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.65ff), the story was told in reference to a young monk who, going to a house to fetch water, saw a young woman and fell in love with her. She encouraged his attentions, and the monk, desiring her, wished to leave the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His explanation, given at Lohapásáda, of the meaning of ubhatobhágavimutta is regarded as the most authoritative interpretation (DA.ii.514). The Visuddhimagga (p.364; see also s.v. Cúlasumma) also mentions a Cúlasumana, resident at Ninkaponnakapadhánaghara on Cittalapabbata. He had discarded desire, and therefore the thought arose in him that he was a saint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cúlasumana.-A householder of Ceylon who fell down dead when Piturájá (q.v.) looked at him and gnashed his teeth in anger. Sp.ii.440f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Cúlasumana.-A novice. In a past life he was the Sumanasetthi, under whom Annabhárá (q.v.) worked. In this age he was born at Munda, near the Viñjhá mountains, as the son of Mahámunda. When Anuruddha became an arahant and looked back into his past lives he saw how Sumana had helped him. He therefore visited Mahámunda and enjoyed his hospitality during one rainy season. At the end of his stay he obtained Munda's consent to ordain Cúlasumana, who became an arahant while his head was being shaved. Once, when Anuruddha suffered from indigestion, the novice Sumana, having discovered that the water from Anotatta would cure him, went there and brought the water, in spite of all the efforts of the Nága-king Pannaka (q.v.) to prevent him. Later, Pannaka, realising the novice's power, asked his pardon and became his friend and servitor. When Anuruddha went with Sumana to Sávatthi to visit the Buddha, some of the monks began to play with Sumana, patting his head and tweaking his ears. In order to show them Sumana's power, Anuruddha asked Ananda to summon all the novices in the monastery and ask them to fetch </data>
<data>water from Anotatta that he might wash his feet. Only Sumana, the youngest of them all, was able to do this, and his fame spread beyond all measure (DhA.iv.128ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

At the insistent request of his friend Uggasetthi, and after consultation with the Buddha, Anáthapindika agreed to give her in marriage to Ugga's son. (According to the Anguttara Commentary (ii.482ff), the setthi's name was Kálaka and his city was not Ugga, but Sáketa). But he was an unbeliever, and when Niganthas came to his house on invitation, Subhaddá refused to do obeisance to them. For this she was ordered out of the house by her father-in-law; but she convinced her mother-in-law that the reasons for her behaviour were sound, and at the suggestion of the latter she prepared a meal and invited to it the Buddha and the congregation of monks, by throwing into the air from the top storey of the house eight handfuls of jasmine. The Buddha divined her thoughts and arrived with five hundred arahants. After the meal the Buddha preached the Doctrine and Ugga and his family were converted. As a mark of favour towards Subhaddá the Buddha requested Anuruddha to stay behind at Ugganagara. (DhA.iii.465ff; the story is also given in AA.ii.482ff, but with several variations in detail. There seems to be a comparison between the stories of Mahásubhaddá and Cúlasubhaddá. See also AA.i.146 and Vsm.390). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cúlasubhaddá, while still in her father's house, had become a Sotápanna, and with her sisters, Mahásubhaddá and Sumaná, she had been entrusted with the distribution of food to the monks.

One day Candá was playing with her seven-months-old baby with whom she was so engrossed that, when the king entered the room, she omitted to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This roused the king's jealousy, and he sent for the executioner and had the prince's hands and feet and head cut off and his body encircled with sword-cuts &quot; as though with a garland.&quot; He paid no heed to Candá's lamentations, and she, in her great sorrow, fell down dead of a broken heart. Flames arose from Avíci, and wrapping Mahápatápa about, &quot;as with a woollen garment,&quot; plunged him in the lowest hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was, told in reference to Devadatta's attempts to kill the Buddha. Devadatta was Mahápatápa and Mahá Pajápatí was Candá (J.iii.177-82). The Játaka is often cited (E.g., J.iv.11; v.113) to illustrate how anger, when once arisen, is difficult to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cúlasamudda&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Elder of Ceylon (Tambapanni). Once, in a time of famine, seven hundred monks came to him early in the day. Realising that he could not get alms anywhere in Ceylon, he took them across to Pátaliputta by the power of his iddhi. Before he started the monks asked him the time, and when he told them they said, &quot;But, Sir, Pátaliputta is far off!&quot; &quot;Friends, aged elders seize the distance and make it near.&quot; &quot;Where is the ocean, Sir?&quot; &quot;Friends, that was the dark ditch you passed on the way!&quot; &quot;But, Sir, the ocean is large!&quot; &quot;Friends, aged elders make the great small.&quot; (Vsm.403). The Majjhima Commentary (ii.758) mentions a Gavilangana-vási Cúlasammuda who, when asked what he wished for, answered, &quot;Lokuttara things only.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was the third river crossed by Mahá Kappina and his wife on their way from their own country, in the north-west, to Sávatthi (ThagA.i.508). The river was one league deep and one wide (DhA.ii.120) and eighteen leagues in length, with a rapid current (DA.iii.877, 878). On its bank was a large banyan-tree where the Buddha awaited Kappina's arrival (AA.i.177; SA.ii.179). The Milinda (p.114) mentions it as one of the ten important rivers flowing from the Himálaya. The name is evidently old, as it occurs in several ancient legends (E.g., Ap.i.75; ThagA.i.390; ThigA.9, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Candabhágá is generally identified with the Chenab (the Akesines of the Greeks). But see Ps. of the Brethren 255, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Candabhágá.-A canal constructed by Parakkamabáhu I., flowing through the centre of the Lakkhuyyána.

He belonged to a wealthy brahmin family of Rájagaha and was called Candábha because from the circle of his navel proceeded a light resembling that of the moon's disk. When he grew up, the brahmins seated him in a carriage and took him about, proclaiming that whoever stroked his body would receive power and glory. By this means they earned much money. One day, in Sávatthi, a dispute arose between the brahmins and the Buddha's followers as to Candábha's supernatural powers, and finally they took him to the Buddha for him to settle the quarrel. As Candábha approached the Buddha, the light from his body disappeared and Candábha, thinking that this was owing to some charm, asked to be taught the same. The Buddha stipulated that he should join the Order. Having done so, Candábha was asked to meditate on the thirty-two constituent parts of the Body. Soon afterwards he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous birth he was a forester and formed a friendship with a merchant to whom he supplied red sandalwood. One day, when he visited the merchant in the town, he was taken by him to the place where a shrine was being erected over the remains of Kassapa Buddha. The forester, making a moon-disk from sandalwood, placed it within the shrine. After death, for a whole Buddha-interval, he was in Távatimsa and was known as the deva Candábha. DhA.iv.187ff; the SNA. version (ii.523ff) differs from this in several details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Candábha.&lt;/b&gt; Sixteen thousand kappas ago there were four kings of this name, all previous births of Ekadípiya (Ap.i.189).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There the Buddha sings the praises of Vesáli and declares that, if he would, he could live for a whole kappa. Ananda does not act on the hint. When Ananda leaves him, Mára asks that the Buddha should die, as his disciples have been fully trained. The Buddha agrees, and declares that he will die in three months time. S.v.258ff; the incident is also given in D.ii.102ff and Ud.vi.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Cora Sutta.-An evil monk is like a robber-chief, in that he relies on roughness of the way, the entanglements, the help of the powerful; he gives bribes and works alone. A.iii.128f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cora Sutta.-There are eight things which lead to speedy disaster in the case of a robber - he strikes those who do not strike back, takes away everything completely, kills women, seduces maidens, robs recluses, despoils the king's treasury, carries out his activities too near, is unskilled in storing up his gain (A.iv.339).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Subha acknowledges the Buddha as his teacher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (MA.ii.962) calls this the Subha Sutta.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cullanárada Játaka (No.477)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;v.l. &lt;b&gt;Cullanáradakassapa&lt;/b&gt;.-The Bodhisatta was once a rich brahmin who, on the death of his wife, retired with his son to the Himálaya and became an ascetic. One day a girl, having been carried off by thieves, escaped from them and arrived at the ascetic's but when the Bodhisatta was away. The son fell a victim to her charms and agreed to return with her to the haunts of men. She went on ahead and he was to follow, but his father, hearing of what had occurred during his absence, described to the youth the snares of household life in such a graphic way that he gave up the idea of following the girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a vain monk who succumbed to the wiles of a maiden of Sávatthi. The girl's mother used her to entice the monk to become her son-in-law. The Buddha warned him that in the past the same girl had tried to destroy his spiritual life (J.iv.219-24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Játaka itself the Bodhisatta's son is called Nárada (p.222), but elsewhere (J.i.416, 417) he is referred to as Cullatápasa (probably only a descriptive title). It was in reference to the same monk that the Munika, the Udañcani, the Sálúka and the Arañña Játakas were related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There was once a king called Pacetana who asked his wheelwright to make a pair of wheels for a battle which was to take place six months later. When but six days remained of this period, only one wheel had been made, but the other was finished within the stipulated time. Pacetana thought that both wheels were alike, but the wheelwright proved to him that the one he had made hurriedly was faulty in various ways, owing to the crookedness of its parts. The Buddha identified himself with the wheelwright and declared that one must be free from all crookedness in order not to fall away from the Dhamma and the Vinaya. A.i.109f. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Cakkavatti Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-With the appearance of a Cakkavatti there appear seven treasures in the world; similarly, with the appearance of a Tathágata there appear the seven treasures of wisdom - mindfulness, searching of the Dhamma, energy, zest, tranquillity, concentration, equanimity. S.v.99. It was also evidently called Ratana Sutta. See DA.i.250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Channa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Channa&lt;/b&gt;.-A Wanderer, classed among those who wore clothes (paticchannaparibbájaka). He is only mentioned once, in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.iii.215), where we are told that he visited Ananda at Sávatthi and asked him questions about the Buddha's teaching (see Channa Sutta below). Both the Sutta and the Commentary (AA.i.432) add that he was pleased with Ananda's explanation, and admitted that the Buddha's teachings were worthy of being followed, though it is not explicitly stated that he accepted them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Channa.&lt;/b&gt;-A Thera. No particulars of his early life are available. He once stayed at Gijjhakúta, dangerously ill and suffering much pain. He was visited by Sáriputta and Mahá Cunda, and when they discovered that he contemplated suicide, they tried to deter him, promising to provide him with all necessaries and to wait on him themselves. Finding him quite determined, Sáriputta discussed with him the Buddha's teachings and then left him. Soon afterwards Channa committed suicide by cutting his throat. When this was reported to the Buddha, he explained that no blame was attached to Channa, for he was an arahant at the moment of death (M.iii.263ff; S.iv.55ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (MA.ii.1012f.; SA.iii.12f ) that after cutting his throat, Channa, feeling the fear of death, suddenly realised that he was yet a puthujjana. This thought so filled him with anguish that he put forth special effort, and by developing insight became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channa had friends and relations in the Vajjian village of Pubbavijjhana (v.l. Pubbavajira), and came himself from there. v.l. Chandaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Channa.&lt;/b&gt;-Gotama's charioteer </data>
<data>and companion, born on the same day as Gotama (J.i.54; Mtu.ii.156, 164, 189, 233; iii.91, 262; BuA.233; SA.ii.231; DhsA.34. ThagA. (i.155) says he was the son of a servant woman of Suddhodana). When Gotama left household life, Channa rode with him on the horse Kanthaka as far as the river Anomá. There Gotama gave him his ornaments and bade him take Kanthaka back to his father's palace (A thúpa was later erected on the spot where Channa turned back; Dvy.391). When, however, Kanthaka died of a broken heart, Channa's grief was great, for he had suffered a double loss. It is said that he begged for leave to join Gotama as a recluse, but this leave was refused (J.i.64f). He therefore returned to Kapilavatthu, but when the Buddha visited his Sákiyan kinsfolk, Channa joined the Order. Because of his great affection for the Buddha, however, egotistical pride in &quot;our Buddha, our Doctrine&quot; arose in him and he could not conquer this fondness nor fulfil his duties as a bhikkhu. (ThagA.i.155; his verse (No.69) quoted in Thag. does not, however, refer to any such remissness on his part).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when in the Ghositáráma in Kosambí, Channa committed a fault but was not willing to acknowledge it. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he decreed that the ukkhepaniya-kamma be carried out against him, forbidding him to eat or dwell with the Sangha. He therefore changed his residence, but was everywhere &quot;boycotted,&quot; and returned to Kosambí subdued and asking for reprieve, which was granted to him. Vin.ii.23ff. His obstinacy and perverseness are again mentioned elsewhere - e.g., Vin.iv.35, 113, 141. A patron of his once erected a vihára for him, but he so thatched and decked it that it fell down. In trying to repair it he damaged a brahmin's barley field (Vin.iii.47). See also Vin.iii.155f., 177.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Later, in a dispute between the monks and the nuns, he deliberately sided with the latter; this was considered so perverse and so lacking in proper esprit de corps, that the Buddha decreed on him the carrying out of the Brahmadanda whereby all monks were forbidden to have anything whatsoever to do with him. This was the last disciplinary act of the Buddha, and the carrying out thereof was entrusted to Ananda. D.ii.154. It would, however, appear from DhA.ii.110 that the Brahmadanda was inflicted on Channa for his having repeatedly reviled Sáriputta and Moggallána in spite of the Buddha's warning. In this version other details also vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ananda visited Channa at the Ghositáráma and pronounced on him the penalty, even his proud and independent spirit was tamed; he became humble, his eyes were opened, and dwelling apart, earnest and zealous, he became one of the arahants, upon which the penalty automatically lapsed (Vin.ii.292). In the past, Channa met Siddhattha Buddha going towards a tree, and being pleased with him, spread for him a soft carpet of leaves round which he spread flowers. Five kappas ago he became king seven times, under the name of Tinasantháraka (ThagA.i.155).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Senásanadáyaka of the Apadána (i.137).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channa is identified with the hunter in the Suvannamiga (III.187), the Gijjha (III.332), the Rohantamiga (IV.423), the Cúlahamsa (V.354), and the Maháhamsa (V.382) Játakas, with the wrestler in the Sálikedára Játaka (IV.282) and with Cetaputta in the Vessantara Játaka (VI.593).

He was very fond of watching dancing and had three dancing halls where girls and women, of various ages, danced for his pleasure. One day he noticed a house-holder's wife who had come to watch the dance and longed to possess her. On realising the wickedness of his desire, he renounced the kingdom and became a Pacceka Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Udánagáthá is included in the Khaggavisána Sutta.

At that time the Kosambí monks had become contentious, but Gavaccha remained steadfast and attained to arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a labourer and, finding the monk Sujáta looking for pieces of stuff for a robe, gave him his garment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, he was king of the devas thirty-three times and king of men seven times (Thag.11; ThagA.i.55f). He is, perhaps, identical with Upaddhadussadáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.ii.435f; but the same verses are, in ThagA. (i.266) also attributed to Heraññakáni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He learns how Pilotika, having heard the Buddha's teachings to nobles, Brahmins, house-holders and recluses, was convinced that the Buddha was all-enlightened, just as an expert elephant-tracker seeing a broad elephant-footprint would conclude that it indicated the track of a really large elephant. Jánussoni goes to visit the Buddha and reports his conversation with Pilotika. The Buddha tells him it would be a mistake to conclude at once from seeing a broad footprint that it belonged to a very large elephant; there are many other possibilities which should first be eliminated. He then proceeds to describe the life of a real recluse, the disciple of the Noble One, and the attainments he reaches; these he calls the Truth-finder's foot prints. Following this, the disciple makes further discoveries, till his mind is completely free from the ásavas, and then he realises the Truth-finder's real quest. Jánussoni becomes a follower of the Buddha (M.i.175ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the first sutta preached in Ceylon by Mahinda to Devánampiyatissa. At the end of the discourse the king accepts the Three Refuges. Mhv.xiv.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Thereafter he held an annual festival in honour of the Nága-king. The Bodhisatta, a very poor man, saw Campeyya's splendour on his way to the feast and longed for a like greatness. As a result, after death, he was born in the Nága world where he became king under the name of Campeyya. Realising what had happened, he felt disgust at his position as a Nága and made many attempts to observe religious vows, hoping, in this way, to gain release. But he was foiled in his efforts by his consort Sumaná. At last he came to the world of men, where he kept fast on certain days, lying on an ant-hill. There he was taken captive by a snake charmer who tortured him in various ways and took him about, exhibiting him for gain. By certain tokens of which Campeyya had earlier warned her, Sumaná knew that her husband had been taken captive and, after much searching, she discovered him just as the snake charmer was about to give a performance before Uggasena, king of Benares. The whole story was then revealed, and the snake charmer set Campeyya free. That Uggasena might be convinced of the truth of the story, he was invited to the Nága-world, where he and his retinue were lavishly entertained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in connection with the observance of uposatha vows. Devadatta was the snake charmer and Sáriputta was Uggasena.

He lived at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhimanda')"&gt;Bodhimanda-vihára&lt;/a&gt;, and was present, with thirty thousand monks, at the foundation of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahathupa')"&gt;Mahá-Thúpa&lt;/a&gt;. Mhv.xxxix.41; Dpv.xix.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Cittagutta.&lt;/b&gt;-An Elder living in the Kurandaka Cave. In the cave was a beautiful painting of the Renunciation of the Seven Buddhas, but he never saw it, though he lived there for sixty years. Three times the king sent for him, but he refused to go until the king decreed that no infant in the country should suck milk until the Elder should visit the palace. He dwelt in the palace for seven days and always pronounced the same blessing, no matter who saluted him: &quot;May the king be happy.&quot; On the Elder's return to the cave, the deity in the ironwood tree outside stood holding a torch and the Elder attained arahantship (Vsm.38). It may be the same Elder who is mentioned elsewhere (Vsm.171) as having developed tejo-kasina on regarding the flame of a lamp on his return to the vihára after listening to the Dhamma, and again píta-kasina when he saw on Cittalapabbata a seat spread with pattanga-flowers (Vsm.173).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Cittagutta.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant. He lived in Ambapásána, in the village of Anganakola. He was a fluent speaker, and while yet a puthujjana, preached the Rathaviníta Sutta at the Lohapásáda to a gathering of twelve thousand monks and nuns. In his explanation he referred to the glories of the Relic Chamber in the Mahá-Thúpa. Though he described them in great detail, yet the Elder Mahá Tissa, teacher of Asathakammika-Tissa, being present, told him that his description was incomplete (MT.552f).

Going to his park in the early summer, he rested under a kovilára-tree which was thickly covered with leaves. Going again in midsummer, he found it full of blossom. On his third visit, at the end of the season, the tree was bare and withered, and, lying under it, he realised that decay and death are the common lot of all. He thereupon became a Pacceka Buddha. His udána is included in the Khaggavisána Sutta. SN.vs.44; SNA.i.90f; Ap.i.9 (vs.18); ApA.i.141f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cátumásika-Brahmadatta.-King of Benares. Once in every four months he would visit his park. One day, on entering the park, he saw a páricchattaka-tree covered with blossom, and picked one of the flowers. His retinue followed his example, and soon the tree was quite bare. On his return from the park he observed this, and also how another tree near by, devoid of flowers, had been spared the spoilation. He thereupon reflected how possessions led to trouble, and, renouncing his kingdom, he donned the robes of a monk, later becoming a Pacceka Buddha. His udána is included in the Khaggavisána Sutta.

The Bodhisatta, who was a merchant, hearing this, warned the ascetic that the ram was only preparing to attack him, and even as he was speaking the animal charged the mendicant and felled him to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk of Sávatthi, to whom a similar thing happened while he was wearing a leather jerkin.

Because he was fond of Soma juice and poured out libations of it, they called him Sutasoma. When he came of age his father gave up the throne to him, and he had sixteen thousand wives, of whom Candádeví was the chief consort. As time went on his family became very great, and he wished to become an ascetic as soon as a grey hair appeared on his head. Every-one in the palace tried to turn him from this resolve; rich merchants, like Kulavaddhana, offered him their immense wealth, but all in vain. Having handed over the kingdom to his brother, Somadatta, he donned the garb of an ascetic and left the city unknown to anyone. When his departure was discovered, all the inhabitants of the city left their belongings to follow him. Sakka sent Vissakamma to build for them a hermitage thirty leagues in extent.

The Buddha tells him that the reward of the higher life is not to be found in presents, esteem, or good repute, nor in a life of virtue, rapt concentration, or mystic insight. Immortal deliverance only is the prize and the goal of the higher life. If a man needs the very best of wood, no other part of the tree will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pingala-Koccha accepts the Buddha as his teacher. M.i.198ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was present when five rájás, including Pasenadi, visited the Buddha and asked him which was the highest sensual pleasure.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cannda-ppajjota&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avanti')"&gt;Avanti&lt;/a&gt; in the time of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. His name was Pajjota, the sobriquet being added on account of his violent temper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when ill with jaundice, he asked &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; to lend him the services of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jiivaka')"&gt;Jívaka&lt;/a&gt;, as no other doctor could cure him. The cure for the malady was ghee, for which Pajjota had a strong aversion. Jívaka, therefore, decided to administer it disguised in an astringent decoction, and obtained the king's permission to use any of the royal animals or to leave the city at any time he wished, on the plea that he must go in search of various medicines. When all preparations were complete, Jívaka gave the king the medicine and escaped on Bhaddavatiká, the king's she-elephant, before the truth was discovered. (The elephant could travel fifty yojanas in one day, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaaka')"&gt;Káka&lt;/a&gt;, sixty). The king sent Káka in pursuit, but Jívaka gave Káka a purgative and so delayed his return until the medicine had taken effect on the king. Later, when Pajjota was cured, he sent Jívaka many costly presents, including a garment of Siveyyaka cloth (Vin.i.276ff; AA.i.216).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt; was Pajjota's rival in splendour, and Pajjota decided to take him captive by taking advantage of his fondness for elephants. The plan succeeded and Udena was taken prisoner, but in the end Udena eloped with Pajjota's daughter, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasuladattaa')"&gt;Vásuladattá&lt;/a&gt;, and made her his queen consort. Besides the she-elephant and the slave Káka, already mentioned, Pajjota had three other fleet-footed conveyances: two mares, Celakanthí and </data>
<data>Muñjakesí, both capable of travelling one hundred leagues a day, and an elephant, Nálágiri, able to go one hundred and twenty leagues a day. In a past birth Pajjota had been the servitor of a certain chief. One day, when the chief was returning from the bath, he saw a Pacceka Buddha leaving the city, where he had begged for alms without receiving anything. The chief hurried home and, finding that his meal was ready, sent it to the Pacceka Buddha by the hand of his fleet-footed servant. The servant travelled with all possible haste and, having given the meal to the Pacceka Buddha, expressed certain wishes, as the result of which in this birth he gained possession of the five conveyances. He had authority equal to the power of the sun's rays. (This may be another explanation of the nickname Canda). His last wish was that he should partake of the Truth realised by the Pacceka Buddha (DhA.i.196ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')"&gt;Mahá Kaccána&lt;/a&gt; was the son of Pajjota's chaplain and later succeeded to his father's post. When the king heard of the Buddha's appearance in the world, he sent Kaccána with seven others to the Buddha, to bring him to Ujjeni. But the Buddha sent Kaccána and his companions, now become arahants, to preach to the king and establish the Sásana in Avanti. The mission was successful. The Theragáthá contains stanzas uttered by the Thera in admonition to the king. It is said that the king had faith in the brahmins and held sacrifices involving the slaughter of animals; he was wicked in his deeds. One night he had a dream which frightened him and went to the Thera to have it explained. The Thera told him of the necessity for leading a virtuous life. We are told that from that day the king abandoned his evil ways and lived righteously (Thag.vs.496-501; ThagA.i.483ff; AA.i.116f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dulva (Rockhill, op. </data>
<data>cit., 17), Pajjota was the son of Anantanemi and was born on the same day as the Buddha. He was called Pajjota (Pradyota), because at the time of his birth the world was illumined as if by a lamp. He became king of Ujjeni at the time of the Buddha's Enlightenment (Rockhill, op. cit., 32, n.1). He had a minister called Bharata, a clever mechanic (Rockhill, op. cit., 70, n.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would appear from the Samantapásádiká (Sp.i.214) that Pajjota was born as the result of an ascetic, or some other holy person, having touched the navel of his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pajjota was the friend of Bimbisára, and when the latter was put to death by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt;, Pajjota seems to have made preparations to wage war on Ajátasattu. The defences of Rájagaha were strengthened to meet the threatened attack, but nothing further happened (M.iii.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhanga_jat_522')"&gt;Sarabhanga Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.133) mentions a king Canndapajjota, in whose dominion was Lambacúlaka, where lived the ascetic Sálissara. This either refers to another king of the same name or, more probably, it is an attempt to identify Lambacúlaka with some place in the country over which Pajjota ruled in the time of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His wife was Damiládeví. He was killed by his younger brother Yasalálaka-Tissa. Siva built a tank near Manikáragáma which he gave to the Issarasamanáráma (Dpv.xxi.44; Mhv.xxxv.46). When Ilanága was taken captive by the Lambakannas, his queen sent the little Canda-mukhasiva to the state elephant to be killed by him, but the elephant picked him up and brought about Ilanága's release.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Canndakálí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nun, well known for her quarrelsome propensities. She was a friend of Thullanandá, during whose absence the other nuns once expelled Canndakálí from their midst. This act was greatly resented by Thullanandá and Canndakálí was readmitted (Vin.iv.230). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is several times mentioned as starting quarrels with other nuns, and when they disagreed with her she threatened to denounce the Buddha and the nuns and to join some other Order, declaring that there were other Orders which were, in every way, as good as the Buddha's. Once, when some of her colleagues asked her if she had seen something lost by them, she cursed them roundly and started to weep and create a scene (Vin.iv.276, 277). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was charged with frequenting gatherings of laymen (Vin.iv.293, 309), and it is said (Vin.iv.333) that she joined Thullanandá in various vicious practices. She once applied for permission to ordain nuns (vutthápanasammuti) but was refused, and on discovering that other nuns had obtained this permission she became violently abusive (Vin.iv.331).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was the custom for ancient kings at the time of the Kattika Festival to deck themselves in great array and, standing on the bank of a lake &quot;in the presence of Cittarája,&quot; (meaning, probably, in front of his statue) to shoot arrows to the four quarters. J.ii.372.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cittarája.-A Yakkha whom Pandukábhaya honoured by giving him a settlement at the lower end of the Abhaya tank. On festival days the Yakkha occupied a seat beside the king. The Mahávamsa (xi.4, 84, 87, 104) says that Citta-rája was an incarnation of the herdsman Citta (7) who saved Panduka-bhaya's life, but it is more likely that the Cittarája mentioned here is identical with Cittarája (1), and that the festival refers to the Kattika festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He once went to Jambudípa, embarking at Mahátittha in a boat, in which he dwelt in seclusion. On the way across, while looking at the ocean, he developed ápokasina (Vsm.170).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thera of the same name is mentioned in the Commentaries and is described as a Samyuttabhánaka. It is said that because he dwelt in mettá poison had no effect on him (Vsm.313; AA.i.865). He probably lived in the time of the Bráhmanatissabhaya (q.v.). His colleagues were Isidatta and Mahásona. During the time of the peril, he took leave of his colleagues and went to worship at the Mahávihára. He found it empty and started for the south, when the sprite of a neighbouring tree, assuming human form, looked after him and escorted him to a village near the Jajjaranadí, where he was supported by foresters (?pannakhádakamanussá) till the peril was past (VibhA.446). The Digha Commentary (DA.iii.883) mentions another Cúla-Síva and calls him Tilokanagaravási (v.l. Lokuttaravásí). He was evidently a well-known commentator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Chaddanta&lt;/b&gt;.-A forest in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava')"&gt;Himavá&lt;/a&gt;. In the forest was the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mandakini')"&gt;Mandákiní Lake&lt;/a&gt;, on the banks of which&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/annaa_kondanna')"&gt;Aññá-Kondañña&lt;/a&gt; lived in retirement for twelve years, waited upon by eight thousand elephants who had once ministered to Pacceka Buddhas. SA.i.217; ThagA.ii.3, 7; AA.i.84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Chaddanta&lt;/b&gt;.-A lake, one of the seven great lakes of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava')"&gt;Himálaya&lt;/a&gt; region (A.iv.101; AA.ii.759). It was fifty leagues long and fifty broad. In the middle of the lake, for a space of twelve leagues, the water was like a jewel and no weeds grew there. Around this space were seven girdles of lilies, each girdle of a different hue and each a league in extent. Round the lake were seven ranges of mountains - Cullakála, Mahákála, Udaka, Candapassa, Suriyapassa, Manipassa and Suvannapassa, the last range being seven leagues in height and of a golden hue on the side overlooking the lake. On the west side of the lake was the Kañcanaguhá, twelve leagues in extent, where the elephant-king lived. J.v.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Chaddanta&lt;/b&gt;.-A tribe of elephants, of which tribe the Bodhisatta was once born as king (see No.4). The Chaddantas and the Uposathas are the two highest classes of elephant (DhA.iii.248). The Chaddantakula sometimes provides the hatthiratana for a Cakkavatti, in which case it is the youngest of the tribe who so functions (KhpA.172). Of the ten tribes of elephants enumerated in the books (E.g., UdA.403; VibhA.397) the Chaddanta is classed as the highest, and the Buddha possesses the strength of ten Chaddanta-elephants, each elephant having the </data>
<data>strength of ten thousand million men (BuA.37). These elephants have the power of travelling through the air and are white in hue (J.v.37; Vsm.650).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Chaddanta&lt;/b&gt;.-The Bodhisatta, born as king of the elephants of the Chaddanta tribe, eight thousand in number. His body was pure white, with red face and feet, and seven parts of his body touched the ground. He lived in the Kañcanaguhá on the banks of the Chaddanta Lake, his chief queens being Cúlasubhaddá and Mahásubhaddá. Owing to the preference shown to Mahásubhaddá by Chaddanta, Cúlasubhaddá conceived a grudge against him, and one day, when Chaddanta was entertaining five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, she offered them wild fruits and made a certain wish. As a result she was reborn in the Madda king's family and was named Subhaddá. Later she became chief consort of the king of Benares. Remembering her ancient grudge, she schemed to have Chaddanta's tusks cut off. All the hunters were summoned by the king, and Sonuttara was chosen for the task. It took him seven years, seven months and seven days to reach Chaddanta's dwelling-place. He dug a pit and covered it, and as the elephant passed over it shot at him a poisoned arrow. When Chaddanta realised what had happened, he charged Sonuttara, but, seeing that he was clad in a yellow robe, he restrained himself. Having learnt Sonuttara's story, he showed him how his tusks could be cut off, but Sonuttara's strength was not sufficient to saw them through. Chaddanta thereupon took the saw with his own trunk and, wounded as he was and suffering excruciating pain from the incisions already made in his jaws, he sawed through the tusks, handed them over to the hunter and died. In seven days, through the magic power of the elephant's tusks, Sonuttara returned to Benares; but when Subhaddá heard that her conspiracy had resulted in the death of her former lover and husband, she </data>
<data>died of a broken heart (J.v.36ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaddanta is mentioned as one of the births in which the Bodhisatta practised síla-páramitá (J.i.45). Chaddanta could find delight only in the lakes and forests of the Himálaya, not in the crowded city (Vsm.650).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="chaddanta_jat_514')"&gt;Chaddanta Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

(Vin.ii.262, 266, 269, 271, 276).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that Assaji and Punabbasu had their headquarters at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kitaagiri')"&gt;Kítágiri&lt;/a&gt;, Mettiya and Bhummaja(ka) at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; and Panduka and Lohitaka at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.387).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samantapásádiká (iii.613f) they were all of Sávatthi and all originally acquainted. Finding a living hard to obtain, they entered the Order under the two Chief Disciples. They decided among themselves that it was unwise for them all to live in the same place, and they therefore divided into three groups as mentioned above. Each group had five hundred monks attached to it. Of the three groups, the followers of Panduka and Lohitaka were the most virtuous. They remained near the Buddha, accompanying him on his tours. They did not, like the others, transgress Vinaya rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He rode her into battle, where she helped him in various ways (Mhv.x.53ff). The Mahávamsa-Tíká (p.289) says she was the wife of the Yakkha Jutindhara, who fell in the battle of Sirísavatthu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Culla-Anáthapindika&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eminent lay disciple of the Buddha. He was an Anágámí, and offered to perform a miracle himself before the Buddha showed the Twin Miracle (DhA.iii.210). Culla-Anáthapindika provided food for three months for the multitude, covering an area of twelve leagues, which had assembled at Sávatthi to await the descent of the Buddha from Távatimsa after his preaching of the Abhidhamma Pitaka (DhA.iii.218; AA.i.71). Five hundred monks fed daily at Culla-Anáthapindika's house in Sávatthi (DhA.i.339). He was one of the seven lay disciples of the Buddha who had each five hundred followers (SA.iii.223). Culla-Anáthapindika is generally mentioned (E.g., J.i.148; ii.287, iii.520) together with Pasenadi, Visákhá, and Anáthapindika as the Buddha's eminent lay-patrons. His personal name is not known. The sobriquet was probably given on account of his generosity, rivalling that of Anáthapindika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cúlanága &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Cúlanága Thera.-Generally referred to as Tipitaka-Cúlanága. He was evidently a very famous commentator, and his opinions are quoted in the commentaries of Buddhaghosa. (E.g., MA.i.126; SA.iii.206; DhsA.229, 267, 284; Vm.389; also FsA.405). Cúlanága was the pupil of Summa Thera of Dípavihára (AA.ii.845) and a contemporary of Tipitaka-Cúlabhaya Thera, who seems to have differed from him most violently on certain points (See VihhA.16; also DhsA.230). Cúlanága lived in the reign of Kutakanna-Tissa (16-38 A.C.), and we are told (VibhA.452) that the king held him in great respect. Once the Elder had a boil on his finger, and the king, visiting him, put the finger in his mouth to alleviate the pain. The boil burst and the king swallowed the pus therefrom. When the Elder lay dying the king carried on his head the pot containing his stools, lamenting, &quot;The mainstay of the Dhamma is lost.&quot; The Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.201) tells of an incident which occurred when Cúlanága was preaching in the Lohapásáda. A brahmin, listening to him, was so convinced by the sermon of the impermanence of all things, that he ran home and clasped his son to his heart, saying that he was undone. The Elder once received a bowl which it was not right for him to keep and he gave it to the Sangha (Sp.iii.699). Cúlanága does not always seem to have agreed with his teacher in his interpretations of various matters (VibhA.342). Once when it was announced to Summa that Cúlanága had explained the word thúpíkata in a certain way, he expressed great sorrow and resentment and declared that though he had seven times read the Vinaya with Cúlanága, he had never taught him such an explanation; but Cúlanága was able to uphold his contention (Sp.iv.892; for another incident see Cúla-Summa). Cúlanága once preached the Chachakka Sutta in </data>
<data>Ambilahála Vihára, and on that occasion the audience of men extended to a distance of one gávuta and that of devas to a distance of a league. At the end of the discourse, one thousand monks became arahants (MA.ii.1025).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cúlanága.-A Thera of Vasálanagara. With his brother Mahánága, he entered the Order and, for thirty years, lived in Cittalapabbata, where he attained arahantship. He refused to reveal his identity to his mother when visiting her because he did not wish to have any attachments. SA.ii.125.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Cúlanága.-A Thera of Ceylon. An eminent teacher of the Vinaya. Vin.v.3; Sp.i.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Cúlanága.-A monk of Pidhánagalla in the time of Dutthagámaní. Sanghadattá (q.v.) gave him a robe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Cúlanága.-A monk of Asiggáhaka-parivena. One day, after having obtained alms in Candavankavíthi, he fed a starving bitch. That same evening he got large quantities of ghee and molasses which he gave to his colleagues. For thirty two years he gave alms to thousands of monks from food given to him by the people of Candavankavíthi. Later, he became an arahant. Once, 500 monks on pilgrimage to the Bodhi-tree, took him with them to avert danger. In four months they reached Kottapattana and in seven months the Bodhi-tree, being well entertained everywhere. On the way back Cúlanága was seized with a colic and died; but before death he advised his colleagues to cremate his body and take his ashes that they might be provided with their wants. Ras.ii.122f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Cúlanága.-A fortress in Rájarattha (in Ceylon). Ras.ii.145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Earnestness, above all other things, encourages the arising of good states; indulgence, worst of all things, encourages evil states (A.i.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (AA.i.40) that this sutta was preached at Jetavana to counteract the effects of the Aggikkhandhopama Sutta, which frightened many monks, causing them to revert to the lay life, the Order being thereby greatly impoverished in numbers. The present sutta was designed to reassure those who were in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cakka-vatti&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special name given in the books to a World ruler. The world itself means &quot;Turner of the Wheel,&quot; the Wheel (Cakka) being the well known Indian symbol of empire. There are certain stock epithets used to describe a Cakka-vatti: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;dhammiko, dhammarájá, cáturanto (ruler   of the four quarters), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;vijitáví (conqueror), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;janapadatthaváriyappatto (guardian of   the people's good), and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;sattaratanasamannágato (possessor of   the Seven Treasures). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one thousand sons are his; his dominions extend throughout the earth to its ocean bounds (ságarapariyantam); and is established not by the scourge, nor by the sword, but by righteousness (adandena asatthena dhammen'eva abhivijiva). Particulars are found chiefly in the Mahásudassana, Mahápadána, Cakkavattisíhanáda, Bálapandita and Ambattha Suttas. See also S.v.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadana_s')"&gt;Mahápadána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; it would appear that the birth of a Cakka-vatti is attended by the same miracles as that of the birth of a Buddha. A Cakka-vatti's youth is the same as that of Buddha; he, too, possesses on his body the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapurisa')"&gt;Mahápurisalakkhanáni&lt;/a&gt;, and sooth-sayers are able to predict at the child's birth only that one of two destinies await him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the Seven Treasures of a Cakka-vatti, the &lt;a href="cakkaratana')"&gt;Cakkaratana&lt;/a&gt; is the chief. When he has traversed the Four Continents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pubbavideha')"&gt;Pubbavideha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')"&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</data>

<data>  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;a life longer than that of other men,   good health, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;and popularity with all classes of his   subjects. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The perfume of sandalwood issues from   his mouth, while his body is like a lily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Cakka-vatti is about to die the Wheel slips down from its place and sinks down slightly. When the king sees this he leaves the household life, and retires into homelessness, to taste the joys of contemplation, having handed over the kingdom to his eldest son. At the king's death, the Elephant, the Horse and the Gem return to where they came from, the Woman loses her beauty, the Treasurer his divine vision, and the Adviser his efficiency (DA.ii.635).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cakka-vattis are rare in the world, and are born in kappas in which Buddhas do not arise (SA.iii.131). The &lt;a href="cakkavattisihanaada_s')"&gt;Cakkavattisíhanáda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, however, gives the names of seven who succeeded one another. In the case of each of them the Wheel disappeared, but, when his successor practised the Ariyan duty of a Cakka-vatti, honouring the Dhamma and following it to perfection, the Wheel re-appeared. In the case of the seventh his virtues gradually disappeared through forgetfulness; crime spread, among his subjects, and the Wheel vanished for ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the earlier literature the term Cakka-vatti seems to have been reserved for a World ruler; but later three sorts of Cakka-vattis are mentioned: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;cakkavála- or cáturanta-cakkavatti   (ruling over the four continents), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;dípa-cakkavatti (ruling over one), and  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;padesacakkavatti (over part of one).   (DA.i.249)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;No woman can become a Cakka-vatti (the </data>
<data>reasons for this are given at AA.i.254). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Cakka-vatti is, as worthy of a thúpa as a Buddha. D.ii.143.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cetiyapabbata&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called Cetiyagiri. The later name of the Missaka mountain given on account of its many shrines. Devánampiyatissa built a vihára there - the second vihára in Ceylon - for Mahinda and those ordained under him (Mhv.xvi.12-17). The relics, obtained by Sumanasámanera from Asoka and from Sakka, were deposited there until they were needed. According to the Mahávamsa (Mhv.xxii.23ff) this fact was the occasion for the name. One of the eight saplings of the Sacred Bodhi-tree at Anurádhapura was planted in the drama on Cetiyagiri (Mhv.xix.62). Mahinda spent the last years of his life on Cetiyagiri and died there, and there his relics were enshrined (Mhv.xx.32, 45). Near the mountain was the village of Dváramandala (Mhv.xxiii.23). Kutakannatissa built an uposatha-hall on the mountain and planted a Bodhi-tree, while Bháti-kábhaya supplied food daily to one thousand monks dwelling there (Mhv.xxxiv.30f, 64), and Lañjakatissa had the vihára paved at a cost of one hundred thousand (Mhv.xxxiii.25). Mahádáthikamahánága made four gateways and a road round the mountain, and held the Giribhandapújá with great pomp and ceremony; it is said that in order that the people might approach the mountain with clean feet he spread carpets right up to it from the Kadamba River (Mhv.xxxiv.75ff). Kanirajánutissa had sixty monks of Cetiyapabbata put to death as traitors by flinging them into the cave called Kanira (Mhv.xxxv.11). Vasabha provided four thousand lamps to be lighted on Cetiyagiri (Mhv.xxxv.80), while Jetthatissa gave to the vihára the income derived from the Kálamattika Tank. (Mhv.xxxvi.130; see also Dpv.xv.69; xvii.90; xix.13, and Sp.i.82ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kakusandha, Cetiyagiri was known as Devakúta, in that of Konágamana as Suvannakúta, and in that of </data>
<data>Kassapa as Subhakúta (Sp.i.86f). The Dhammarucikas once occupied the Ambatthalavihára on Cetiyapabbata, it having been given to them by Dhátusena (Cv.xxxviii.75). Aggabodhi supplied a permanent supply of water for the bathing-tank called Nágasondi, on the top of Cetiyagiri (Cv.xlii.28; see Cv. Trs.i.68, n.8), while Aggabodhi III. gave to the vihára the village of Ambillapadara (Cv.xliv.122). Aggabodhi V. restored the ruined buildings of Cetiyapabbata at a cost of one hundred and twenty thousand pieces (Cv.xlviii.7), while the queen of Udaya I, built there the Kanthakacetiya, and her husband decorated the mountain with brightly coloured flags and streamers (Cv.xlix.23, 27). Sena I, gave to the monastery the income from the Kánavápi (Cv.l.72), and Sena II. Provided a hospital for the use of the monks there (Cv.li.73). Kassapa VI. built the Hadayunha Parivena and gifted it to the Dhammarucikas (Cv.lii.18). Parakkamabáhu I restored all the old buildings which had been destroyed and built sixty-four thúpas (Cv.lxxviii.108).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries relate several anecdotes connected with Cetiyapabbata. Maliyadeva Thera recited there the Chachakka Sutta, and sixty listening bhikkhus became arahants (MA.ii.1064). Lomasanága Theca lived in the Padhánaghara in the Piyanguguhá there and overcame the cold he felt by meditating on the Lokantarikaniraya (MA.i.65). Cetiyapabbata was the residence of Kálabuddharakkhita, and King Saddhátissa spent some time there (MA.i.469f. See also Vsm.20, 64; DhSA.194, 200; AA.i.44). At the time that Fa Hsien came to Ceylon there were two thousand monks in Cetiyagiri, including a monk of great fame, called Dharmagupta (Giles: p.72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It is a sermon on the necessity of living in accordance with the Dhamma, with the Dhamma as one s refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta contains the story of the Cakkavatti &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dalhanemi')"&gt;Dalhanemi&lt;/a&gt; and his eldest son, and the manner in which a &lt;a href="cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakka-vatti&lt;/a&gt; administers the law, ruling by righteousness, over a people made virtuous by his instruction. But, later, there is a gradual corruption of morals, followed by the decay and destruction of human life with all its attendant comforts. This is followed by a gradual restoration of virtuousness, accompanied by the return of prosperity and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta also records the prophecy of the coming of the Buddha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metteyya')"&gt;Metteyya&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.58ff).

It is said (Thig.182-8; cp.

Cetaná Sutta.-That which we will and intend to do and with which we are occupied, that becomes an object (árammana) for the persistence of consciousness (viññána). The object being there, there comes to be a station of consciousness. Consciousness being stationed and growing, there is renewed existence with all its consequent ills. S.ii.65f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cetaná Sutta.-Same as above, with &quot;name-and-form&quot; substituted for rebirth, and the other factors of the paticca-samuppáda following there-from. S.ii.66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Cetaná Sutta.-Same as (1), except that consciousness, being stationed and growing, there comes a bending (nati) followed, serially, by a &quot;going to a coming&quot; (ágatigati), decease, rebirth, etc. S.ii.66f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Cetaná Sutta.-Volitioned acts occasioned by form, sound, etc., are impermanent. S.iv.227.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Cetaná Sutta.-The arising of volitional acts is the appearing of decay-and-death; their cessation, its cessation. S.iii.230.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Cetaná Sutta.-The desire and lust that is in will, concerning shape, etc., is corruption of the heart. S.iii.233.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Cetaná Sutta.-Preached to Ananda. Rebirth is due to intention (cetaná) and aspiration (patthána) being established in a lower element because of ignorance. A.i.224.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Cetaná Sutta.-Where there is action of body, speech or mind, there arises pleasure or pain caused by intention (cetaná). This is due to ignorance; when ignorance is destroyed, there is no field or base for such action. A.ii.157f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>

He meets Assaji and, after a preliminary debate with him, goes with a large company of Licchavis to seek the Buddha in the Mahávana. He questions the Buddha on his method of training, and the Buddha explains this to him. The talk then turns on Self, and the Buddha points out the emptiness of Saccaka's contentions. Saccaka (here referred to as Aggivessana) refuses to acknowledge defeat until the Yakkha Vajirapáni threatens to smite him. Saccaka is driven to yield point after point till the sweat streams from his brow, and the Buddha shows the assembled multitude how his own skin remains quite dry. In the end, Saccaka invites the Buddha and his disciples to a meal on the next day. M.i.227ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cánakka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin of Takkasilá, who killed King Dhanananda and placed Candagutta on the throne (Mhv.v.16f.; Mbv.98). In his youth Cánakka looked after his mother, and finding that she was worrying lest he, who was destined for kingly power, should leave her, he broke his tooth, having been told that there his luck resided. One day, on going for alms to Dhanananda's palace, he was insulted, and in order to avenge the insult he kidnapped the king's son, Pabbatakumára. He then adopted Candagutta and, finding him better fitted for kingship than Pabbata, he contrived that the latter should be killed. When preparations had been made, he induced Candagutta to rise in revolt against Dhanananda, and, finally, to kill him and ascend the throne. (See MT.181ff for details, also Candagutta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá Commentary (i.440) states that Tekiccháni's father, Subandhu, roused the jealousy of Cánakka, who had him put in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Cullanandaka&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a monkey named Nandiya and, with his brother Cullanandiya, headed a band of eighty thousand monkeys. They had a blind mother, and finding that when they were away with the herd she never received the fruits they sent her, they decided to stay with her in a banyan-tree near a village. One day a brahmin, who had studied at Takkasilá, entered the forest with a bow and arrow. He had been warned by his teacher Párásariya to curb his wickedness, but he could find no way, apart from killing, of keeping his wife and child. Seeing the aged monkey, he prepared to shoot her, but her sons offered their lives in her stead. The brahmin killed first them and then the mother. On his way home he heard that lightning had hit his house and that his family was dead; he himself was thereupon swallowed up by the fires of hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's wickedness. The hunter was Devadatta. J.ii.199-202.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

For forty-five years he plied his trade, killing pigs in such a way as to retain the flavour of the flesh unimpaired. When death approached he saw before him the fires of Avíci and roared with pain. For seven days he grunted like a pig, crawling on all fours, and no one could prevent him. The monks told the Buddha of the noises they had heard when passing the butcher's house, and the Buddha explained how retribution had fallen on Cunda commensurate with his wickedness.

His chaplain was Kevatta. For their story see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546')"&gt;Mahá Ummagga Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. Cúlani is identified with Sáriputta (J.vi.478). He is also called Cúlaniya (J.vi.437, 477) and Cúlaneyya (J.vi.437).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/peta_vatthu')"&gt;Petavatthu&lt;/a&gt; (Pv.ii.13; PvA.160ff ) contains a story of a queen of Cúlani-Brahmadatta called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ubbarii')"&gt;Ubbarí&lt;/a&gt;, whom he discovered while wandering about in his kingdom disguised as a tailor.

This prediction proved true, but Citta came back once more to the Order, and shortly afterwards became an arahant (A.iii.392ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The DA.

He belonged to the Moriya dynasty and gained the throne through the scheming of Cánakka, who slew the rightful king Dhanananda and his heir Pabbata. (The Mahávamsatíká gives details of how Cánakka contrived to make Candagutta king (pp.181ff)). Candagutta reigned twenty-four years and was succeeded by his son &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bindusara')"&gt;Bindusára&lt;/a&gt;. His grandson was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka')"&gt;Asoka&lt;/a&gt; (Mhv.v.16ff). Candagutta's senior contemporary in Ceylon was Pandukábhaya, who died in the fourteenth year of Candagutta's reign (Dpv.vi.15; Sp.i.72; see also Dpv.v.69, 73, 81; both the Dpv. and the Sp. talk of Pakundakábhaya (sic)). The Milinda (p.292; see also Kathásaritságara i.30) mentions a soldier Bhaddasála, in the service of the Nanda royal family, who waged war against Candagutta. In this war there were eighty &quot;Corpse Dances&quot; in which dead bodies danced. The Theragáthá Commentary (i., p.440) states that the father of the Thera Tekic-Chakári incurred the displeasure of Candagutta, who, at the instigation of Cánakka, cast him into prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

He took a prominent part in the celebrations when the Tree left Pátaliputta (Mbv.152), and later, on his arrival in Ceylon, was appointed by Davánaippiyatissa to beat the golden drum at the Bodhi-tree ceremonies.

The Buddha points out that Sakuladáyi's conception of perfection is vague and undefined, and proves, on examination, empty and faulty. In answer to Sakuladáyi's question as to what the Buddha would define as absolute bliss, the Buddha explains the four Jhánas and the destruction of the Ásavas. Sakuladáyi is converted (M.ii.29ff).

Candapadumá.-The chief consort of the Setthi Mendaka of Bhaddiya, and mother of Dhanañjaya (DhA.i.385). She was, therefore, grandmother of Visákhá. She had been the wife of Mendaka in a previous birth and, during a time of famine, had joined him in giving the only meal they had between them to a Pacceka Buddha. As a result of this act, the rice-pot in her home never became empty, however many people she might feed. In previous existences she had entertained the monks of various Buddhas, taking a rice-pot in one band and a spoon in the other. Therefore, in her left hand was the sign of the lotus, covering the palm, and in her right the sign of the moon. Further, by reason of her having fetched and filtered water for the monks, on the sole of her left foot was marked a lotus and on the right a moon; hence her name, Candapadumá. When the Buddha visited Mendaka's house and, after the meal, preached to the household, Candapadumá became a sotápanna (DhA.iii.363-86). She was one of the five persons of great merit (Mahápuññá) (AA.i.219; PsA.509). The Visuddhimagga (ii.383) calls her Candapadumasirí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

When he grew up his father was filled with despair, and then a dancing-girl offered to seduce the prince. She sang outside his door till he was filled with desire. Eventually he came to know the joys of love, and filled with madness, ran amok through the streets, chasing people. The king banished both his son and his seducer, and they lived in a hut away down the Ganges. One day a hermit visited the hut and, seeing the woman, lost his power of flying through the air. When he saw the Bodhisatta he ran away and fell into the sea. The Bodhisatta, realising his plight, told him of the wiles of women and helped him to regain his lost power, while he himself sent the woman back to the haunts of men and became an ascetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a backsliding brother.

But the Sákiyans of Cátumá and Brahmá Sahampati interceded on their behalf and they were allowed to return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha then preached to them that just as four terrors await the man who enters the water - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;waves, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;crocodiles, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;whirlpools &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;and sharks - &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;so are there four terrors awaiting the monk - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;temper, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;gluttony, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the pleasures of the senses &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;and women.

Their Doctrine is perfect, rightly revealed, rightly preached. M.i.63ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cullapindapátiya(°pátika)-Tissa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk mentioned in the Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.355) in explaining the term mutta-muttaka. A certain lay-woman waited on him for twelve years. One day a fire broke out in the village and burnt her house, together with those of others. The monks who were fed at neighbouring houses went there to enquire whether anything had been served, but Tissa did not arrive until the mealtime, and when given a meal which the woman had prepared with great difficulty, ate it and went away without a word. The woman, however, was not a whit disturbed by the taunts of her neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be the Elder who, in the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.21f), is mentioned as having resided in Gámendaválavihára in Rohana and ordained Milakkha-Tissa. The same Commentary (i.367) mentions a Cullapindapátiya-Tissa of Girivihára in (Ceylon). He, with his divine eye, saw a Tamil gate-keeper of Madhuanganagáma who, having been a fisherman for fifty years, lay dying. The Elder went to his house and made him repeat the Refuges and the Precepts. The man could not repeat beyond the first Precept, but he was born after death in the Cátummahárájika-world, and came to tell the Elder about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Visuddhi Magga (p.116) speaks of an Elder of the same name who had three pupils. They came to him and said they were prepared to do anything whatever for his sake, even to suffer torture and die. He thought them &quot;possible fellows&quot; and preached to them, whereupon they became arahants. The same Elder it may be who saw an elephant-corpse in Káladíghavápi Lake and developed his meditation on the &quot;wormful abomination (Ibid., p.191).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Those who will listen to and trust in the wrong kind of recluse and brahmin and who do not understand good and evil will come to grief, whereas those who hearken to teachers of the right kind will gain deliverance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theme is illustrated by various similes drawn from the picture of a herdsman driving cattle across a ford.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cína&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Páli name of China. It is several times mentioned in the Milindapañha (121, 327), once as a place where ships congregate (359). Nágasena speaks (121) of a contemporary Cínarájá who could charm the ocean by an Act of Truth and could enter the ocean to a distance of one league in his chariot drawn by lions, the waves rolling back at his approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána (ii.359) speaks of the Cínarattha in a list of countries and tribes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., VibbA.159) speak of the softness of Chinese silk (Cínapata).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cúla-Rahulováda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha realises that Ráhula is possessed of the qualities necessary to Deliverance and goes with him to Andhavana for the siesta. There the Buddha demonstrates, by means of question and answer, that all things are impermanent, and impresses on Ráhula the manner in which the disciples of the Ariyans should strive to be delivered from them. Ráhula takes the lesson to heart, and even as it is being delivered attains to arahantship. (M.iii.277f; this sutta is also found at S.iv.105ff, where it is called the Ráhula Sutta). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thousands of devas are present at the preaching of the sermon, and this sutta is therefore given as an illustration of the Buddha's great compassion (E.g., UdA.324; MA.i320; also Mil.20). Among the suttas specially preached to Ráhula, this one emphasises vipassaná (AA.ii.547). It may have been the incidents mentioned in this sutta that were illustrated in the relic-chamber of the Mahá Thúpa. See Mhv.xxx.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cakkana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An upásaka of Ceylon. While he was a boy, his mother once fell grievously ill and the doctors ordered her hare's flesh. Cakkana was sent by his brother into the field, where he caught a hare which, however, out of compassion he set free. His brother blamed him, but Cakkana cured his mother by a saccakiriyá, saying that, inasmuch as he had never deprived anything of life, by the power of that truth his mother should recover. (SA.ii.112; the story is slightly different in MA.i.165). Cakkana's abstinence is one that was maintained &quot;in spite of opportunity&quot; (sampattivirati) and when he had not under-taken to observe any precept. DhsA., p. 103.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cullakálinga Játaka (No.301)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kálinga, king of Dantapura, anxious to make a fight, sent his four daughters of surpassing beauty into every kingdom, offering them to any man who would fight him for them. Assaka, king of Potali, with the advice of his minister Nandisena, accepted the challenge. Kálinga thereupon came with his mighty army, and the Bodhisattva who was an ascetic declared, after consultation with Sakka, that victory would be his. But Nandisena, undaunted, instructed Assaka as to how he should kill the tutelary deity of Kálinga when this deity, in the guise of a white bull, should appear on the battlefield. Nandisena led the attack of the soldiers, the white bull was killed and Kálinga defeated. He had to provide dowries for his daughters, and thenceforth the two kings lived as friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Sáriputta who is identified with Nandisena. Two Jains, a man and a woman, each versed in five hundred theses, met in Vesáli and the Licchavis arranged a marriage between them. They had one son, Saccaka, and four daughters, Saccá, Lolá, Avavádaká and Patácárá. After the death of their parents, the girls wandered from city to city for purposes of disputation. They came at last to Sávatthi, where they set up at the city gate a jambu-tree, to be pulled up by anyone accepting their challenge to a discussion. Sáriputta, seeing the branch, had it removed, and when the girls came to him with a great crowd of people, answered all their questions and defeated them in debate. There-upon they entered the Order under Uppalavanná, and the fame of Sáriputta increased. J.iii.1ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Thoughts about Ill, etc., should be cultivated. S.v.418.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Cintá Sutta.-Once a man, having left Rájagaha, came to the Sumágadhá Lotus Pond and started speculating about the world. He then saw a whole army entering a lotus-stalk. Thinking himself mad, he returned to the town, where he told people what he had seen; they confirmed his belief in his madness. But, in fact, said the Buddha, what he saw was real; he saw the Asura-host running away from the Devas and escaping through a lotus stalk. It is, therefore, unprofitable to speculate about the world.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Cúlasumma&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eminent Commentator of Ceylon, teacher of Tipitaka Cúlanága. The pupil seems to have disagreed with some of the explanations of his teacher - e.g., as to the meaning of ekáyanamagga. Cúlanága said it referred to pubbabhágasatipatthánamagga, but Cúlasumma held that it referred to missakamagga. They could come to no decision; but while on his way to the bathing-place, Cúlasumma revolved the problem in his mind, and discovering that his pupil was right announced his mistake when Cúlanága was preaching on the day of the first quarter. Cúlanága, realising how even his teacher could go astray on this point, explained it at great length for the benefit of future generations (DA.iii.744f.; MA.i.187). The Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.845) calls him Dípaviháravásí, while the Vibhanga Commentary (p.489; probably Cúlasumma is here a misreading for Cúlasumana) says that he dwelt in Ninkaponnapadhánaghara in Cittalapabbata. The Samantapásádiká (iv.892) says that he lived in Rohana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was called Citta and his brother Sambhúta. One day, when they were out sweeping, two rich women on their way to the park noticed them and turned back. Their followers, disappointed at their loss of a picnic, beat the two Candálas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the brothers went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt; to study. Citta became very proficient, and was sent one day, in place of his teacher, to the house of a villager who had invited the teacher and his pupils. But while there, in a moment of forgetfulness, the brothers used the Candála dialect, and having thus disclosed their caste, were driven out of Takkásilá.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their next birth they became does and in a subsequent birth ospreys. They were always together and always met their death together. Later Citta was born as the son of the chaplain of Kosambí, and Sambhúta as son of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarapancaala')"&gt;Uttarapañcála&lt;/a&gt;. Citta, becoming an ascetic at the age of sixteen, remembered his past births. He waited till Sambhúta had reigned for fifty years, and knowing that he also had some recollection of his previous existences, taught a stanza to a lad and sent him to recite it before the king. Sambhúta heard the stanza, remembered his brother, and, after inquiry, visited Citta, who had then gone to the royal park. There Citta gave him counsel, and not long after Sambhúta renounced the world. After death they were both born in the Brahma world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with Sambhúta. The story was told in reference to two monks, colleagues of Mahá-Kassapa, who were </data>

He was an Anágámí according to the Játaka account (J.i.381f.) and a Sakadágámi according to the DhA. (i.380f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when listening to the Buddha's teaching, he failed to notice and do reverence to the king, Pasenadi, who arrived during the discourse. Later, when summoned to the king's palace, he went with every sign of respect and paid obeisance to the king. When asked why he had not so behaved on the previous occasion, Chattapáni replied that such an action would have been discourteous to the Buddha. Thereupon Pasenadi asked him to act as instructor in the Dhamma to the women of the palace, but he refused the invitation, deeming that such a course would be unseemly and unwise. The task was therefore given to Ananda. DhA.i.380f; cp. Vin.iv.157. The story is also found in J.i.381f, with several variations in detail. There we are told that the Buddha, seeing that the king was displeased, made special mention to him of Chattapáni's attainments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Chattapáni.&lt;/b&gt;-The barber of King Yasapáni. His story is related in the Dhammaddhaja Játaka (q.v.). He had four virtues - he was free from envy, drank no intoxicants, had no strong desires and no wrath. In one of his previous lives he was a king whose queen carried on intrigues with sixty-four of the slaves. Having failed to tempt the Bodhisatta, she spoke calumny against him and had him put in prison. But he explained the matter to the king and was released. From that time the king gave up envy. In another birth he was a king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, strongly addicted to drinking and meat-eating; one day the meat prepared for him was eaten by the palace dogs. It </data>
<data>was fast-day, and as there was no meat in the town the cook sought the queen's advice. When the king sat down to eat, his small son, whom he much loved, was brought to him in the hope that he might forget to ask for meat. But the plan failed, and in his drunkenness he twisted his son's neck and had his flesh cooked for him to eat. Thence-forth he refrained from strong drink and meat-eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other births of Chattapáni are mentioned, once as Kitavása and once as Araka (q.v.). He is identified with Sáriputta. J.ii.186-96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

They talked together about religion until a jackal came and interrupted them. Then the geese flew away and did not return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told of an old monk who interrupted a conversation between Sáriputta and Moggallána.

King Kutakanna(tissa), while staying in Uppalavápi, once sent for him out of his great respect for him. The Thera came and resided in Málárámavihára. Having discovered from the Elder's mother that Cúlasudhamma was fond of radishes (?kanda), the king prepared some and took them to the vihára, but, while offering them to the Elder, he could not bring himself to look at his face. When leaving the vihára, he asked his queen, &quot;what did the Elder look like?&quot; But she replied that if he, who was the Elder's follower (parisa), could not look at him, how could she do so? The king marvelled that the son of one of his subjects should have such power. VibhA.452.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Catuposathika Játaka was evidently one such story, which was later included in the Vidhura Játaka, as its first section, and came to be known as the Catuposathikakhanda (see below) of that Játaka.

He visited the Chief Elder of the Mahávihára when all the other monks were away, in order to test him. The Elder had very weak eyes, but when the king touched his feet as would a snake, he remained unafraid and asked who was there. The story is related to show that arahants know no fear.

When the Buddha came to Opasáda, Cankí visited him, in spite of the protests of his friends and colleagues, and on this occasion was preached the Cankí Sutta (M.ii.164f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not told that Cankí ever became a follower of the Buddha, though Buddhaghosa says that he held the Buddha in great esteem.

Campá&lt;/b&gt;.-A city in India on the river of the same name; it was the capital of Anga and was celebrated for its beautiful lake, the Gaggará-pokkharaní (q.v.), which was excavated by Queen Gaggará. On its banks was a grove of campaka-trees, well known for the fragrance of their marvellous white flowers, and there, in the Buddha's time, wandering teachers were wont to lodge. The Buddha himself stayed thereon several occasions (Vin.i.312; S.i.195; A.iv.59, 168; v.151, 189). Sáriputta (A.iv.59) and Vangísa (S.i.195) are also said to have stayed there. The Mahá Parinibbána Sutta (D.ii.147) mentions Campá as one of the six important cities of India, its foundation being ascribed to Mahágovinda (D.ii.235). It lay at a distance of sixty yojanas from Mithilá (J.iv.32). In the Buddha's time the people of Campá owed allegiance to Bimbisára, as king of Magadha, and Bimbisára had given a royal fief in Campá to the brahmin Sonadanda (D.i.111). Campá was evidently an important centre of trade, and we are told that merchants travelled from there to Suvannabhúmi for purposes of trade (E.g., J.vi.539). Most probably it was the Indian colonists from Campá who named one of their most important settlements in Indo-China after this famous old town. The ancient name of Campá was probably Málini or Málina.( Campasya tu puri Campá, yá Málinyabhavat purá; Mbh.xii.5, 6, 7; Matsyapurána 48, 97, etc.; Law, A.G.I.6, n.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ninth chapter of the Mahá Vagga of the Vinaya Pitaka (Vin.i.312ff; see also Vin.ií.307) contains several important regulations laid down by the Buddha at Campá regarding the validity and otherwise of formal acts of the Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campá is mentioned as the birthplace of Sona-Kolivisa, Jambugámika, Nandaka and Bharata, and among those who resided </data>

It was visited by Hiouen Thsang (Beal, Records ii.187f), and Fa Hien calls it a great kingdom with many places of worship (p.65).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha's bathing-robe was enshrined in Campá (Bu.xxviii.9).

Cunda&lt;/b&gt;.-A worker in metals (kammáraputta) living in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava')"&gt;Pává&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; reached Pává on his way to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa')"&gt;Kusinárá&lt;/a&gt;, he stayed in Cunda's Mango grove. There Cunda visited him and invited him and the monks to a meal the next day. The meal consisted of sweet rice and cakes and súkaramaddava. At the meal the Buddha ordered that he alone should be served with súkaramaddava, and that what was left over should be buried in a hole. This was the Buddha's last meal, as very soon after it he developed dysentery (D.ii.126; Ud.viii.5). The Buddha, a little while before his death, gave special instructions to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; that he should visit Cunda and reassure him by telling him that no blame at all attached to him and that he should feel no remorse, but should, on the contrary, rejoice, in that he had been able to give to the Buddha a meal which, in merit, far exceeded any other (D.ii.135f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Suttanipáta Commentary (SNA.i.159) mentions that, at this meal, Cunda provided golden vessels for the monks' use; some made use of them, others did not. One monk stole a vessel and put it in his bag. Cunda noticed this but said nothing. Later, in the afternoon, he visited the Buddha and questioned him as to the different kinds of samanas there were in the world. The Buddha preached to him the &lt;a href="cunda_s')"&gt;Cunda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds (p.166; also UdA.399) that Cunda reached no attainment, but merely had his doubts dispelled. The Digha Commentary, however, says (DA.ii.568) that he became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;Sotápanna&lt;/a&gt; at the first sight of the Buddha and built for him a </data>
<data>vihára at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambavana')"&gt;Ambavana&lt;/a&gt;. This latter incident, probably, took place at an earlier visit of the Buddha, for we are told (D.iii.207) that while the Buddha was staying in Cunda's Mango grove, he was invited by the Mallas to consecrate their new Mote-hall, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ubbhataka')"&gt;Ubbhataka&lt;/a&gt;. He accepted the invitation, preached in the hall till late at night, and then requested Sáriputta to continue, which he did by preaching the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sangiti_sutta')"&gt;Sangíti Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. This was soon after the death of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nátaputta&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.210).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikáya (v.263ff) mentions another conversation between the Buddha and Cunda. Cunda tells the Buddha that he approves of the methods of purification (soceyyáni) laid down by the brahmins of the west (Pacchábhúmaká). The Buddha tells him of the teaching of the Ariyans regarding the threefold defilement and purification of the body, the fourfold defilement and purification of the speech, and the threefold defilement and purification of the mind. Cunda accepts the Buddha's explanations and declares himself his follower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Cunda&lt;/b&gt;.-The books appear to refer to two theras by the name of Cunda, the better known being &lt;b&gt;Mahá-Cunda&lt;/b&gt; and the other Cúla-Cunda. But the legends connected with them are so confused that it is not possible to differentiate clearly one from the other.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is also made of a &lt;b&gt;Cunda-Samanuddesa&lt;/b&gt; whom, however, the Commentaries (E.g.. DA.iii.907) identify with Mahá-Cunda. Mahá-Cunda is, for instance, described in the Theragáthá Commentary (ThagA.i.261; see also DhA.ii.188 and AA.ii.674) as the younger brother of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;, under whom he </data>
<data>joined the Order, winning arahantship after arduous and strenuous effort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')"&gt;Vipassí&lt;/a&gt; Buddha he had been a potter and had given to the Buddha a bowl made of clay. The Apadána verses quoted in the Theragáthá Commentary are, in the Apadána itself (Ap.ii.444), ascribed to a monk named&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekapattadaayaka_th')"&gt;Ekapattadáyaka&lt;/a&gt;. They make no mention whatever of his relationship to Sáriputta. On the other hand, there are to be found elsewhere in the Apadána (Ap.i.101f) certain verses ascribed to a Cunda Thera, which definitely state that he was the son of the brahmin&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vanganta')"&gt;Vanganta&lt;/a&gt;, and that his mother was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rupasari')"&gt;Sárí&lt;/a&gt;. But in these verses he is called Cúla-Cunda, and mention is made of his previous birth in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siddhattha')"&gt;Siddhattha&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, to whom he gave a bouquet of jasmine flowers. As a result he became king of the devas seventy-seven times and was once king of men, by name Dujjaya. It is further stated that he became arahant while yet a sámanera and that he waited upon the Buddha and his own brother and other virtuous monks. This account goes on to say that after his brother's death, Cunda brought his relics in a bowl and presented them to the Buddha, who uttered praises of Sáriputta. This would identify Cúla-Cunda with Cunda Samanuddesa who, according to the Samyutta Nikáya (S.v.161f), attended Sáriputta in his last illness and, after his death, brought to the Buddha at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; Sáriputta's bowl and outer robe and his relics wrapt in his water-strainer. Therefore if Buddhaghosa is correct in identifying Cunda Samanuddesa with Mahá-Cunda, then all three are one and the same. (Buddhaghosa </data>
<data>says that the monks called him Samanuddesa in his youth before his upasampadá, and he never lost the name, DA.iii.907).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunda Samanuddesa was, for some time, the personal attendant of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.ii.124; J.iv.95, etc.), and when the Buddha prepared to perform the Twin Miracle, offered to perform a miracle himself and so save the Buddha trouble and exertion (DhA.iii.211). Cunda's teacher was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;, and it was to Ananda that he first brought the news of Sáriputta's death. (SA.iii.178; see also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasadika_sutta')"&gt;Pásádika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samagama')"&gt;Sámagáma Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, where Cunda brings to Ananda and then to the Buddha the news of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nátaputta's&lt;/a&gt; death; see also the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sallekha_sutta')"&gt;Sallekha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahá-Cunda was evidently a disciple of great eminence, and is mentioned by the Buddha (A.iii.299; see also M.iii.78; Ud.i.5) in company with the Two Chief Disciples, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kotthita')"&gt;Mahá Kotthita&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')"&gt;Mahá Kaccána&lt;/a&gt; and other very eminent Elders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pitakas contain several discourses (A.iii.355; v.41, 157) given to the monks by Mahá-Cunda while residing at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sahajati')"&gt;Sahajátí&lt;/a&gt; among the Cetis, probably after the Buddha's death. Cunda (or Cundaka as he is called in this context) was with the Buddha in his last journey to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa')"&gt;Kusinárá&lt;/a&gt;, and spread a bed for him in the Mango grove by the Kakutthá River (D.ii.134f; Ud.viii.5).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunda is mentioned (S.iv.50f.; M.iii.263f ) as having </data>
<data>accompanied &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; when he went to see&lt;a href="channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kalandakanivaapa')"&gt;Kalandakanivápa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;, just before Channa's suicide. Once, when the Buddha lay ill in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kalandakanivaapa')"&gt;Kalandakanivápa&lt;/a&gt;, Cunda visited him and they talked of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/b_f/bojjhanga')"&gt;bojjhangas&lt;/a&gt;. There and then the Buddha's sickness vanished. S.v.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

He had a prodigious memory. Once he shut three of the gates of Anurádhapura, allowing only one door for the use of those leaving the city. As each person went out he asked his name, and each of these names he was able to repeat when the owner returned in the evening to the city (DA.ii.530). He was a contemporary of Cúlanága (DhsA.230; SA.iii.206), with whom he held discussions. His description (given at the Lohapásáda) (DA.ii.442) of the details connected with the first words uttered by the Buddha after his birth, and the manner in which he walked, is accepted as authentic. He once went with a company of monks on a pilgrimage to Nágadípa. On the way he stayed in a monastery. One of his followers, who lacked self-control, made friends with another of like temperament in the vihára, and Cúlábhaya, seeing them laugh aloud, pointed out how truly the Buddha had said in the Dhátusamyutta that like joins with like.

There, filled with joy on hearing the news of the Buddha’s appearance in the world, he went to Sávatthi and visited him. The Buddha preached to him, and at the end of the sermon he entered the Order, attaining arahantship (SNA.i.294f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is a short dissertation on true friendship.

When his father died, he left the world and became an ascetic, with great supernatural powers. He went to Benares, and was invited by the king to live in the royal park. He accepted the invitation, and lived there for twelve years. The king was then called away to quell a frontier rebellion, and instructed the queen to look after the ascetic. One day, as the Bodhisatta came in late for his meal, the queen rose hastily and her robe of fine cloth fell from her. Harittaca was filled with lust, and, taking her hand and drawing a curtain round them, he lay with her. This then became a daily occurrence and the scandal spread abroad. The ministers wrote to the king, who, however, refused to believe them. When he returned he questioned the queen, who confessed her wrongdoing, but even then the king refused to believe it till Harittaca (or Hárita as he is also called) acknowledged his guilt. The king was full of admiration for his truthfulness and forgave him, but Harittaca, after preaching to the king on the misery of sinful desire, once more developed his mystic powers, took leave of the king, and returned to the Himálaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had grown discontented because of a beautiful woman.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Hatthaka, called Alavaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eminent lay disciple of the Buddha declared foremost among those who gather a following by means of the four bases of sympathy (catúhi vatthúhi parisam sanganhantánam) (A.i.26). He was the son of the, king of Alaví (hence his name Alavaka), and the Buddha saved him from being eaten by the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavaka')"&gt;Yakkha Alavaka&lt;/a&gt;. He was given the name of Hatthaka because he was handed to the Buddha by the Yakkha, after the latter's conversion, and by the Buddha to the king's messengers. He was thus &quot;handed&quot; from one to another (hatthato hattham gatattá) (AA.i.212; SNA.i.240).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he grew up Hatthaka heard the Buddha preach, and, in due course, became an Anágámí. He was always accompanied by five hundred lay disciples, and was one of seven laymen who had such a following (SA.iii.223). The books record several conversations between the Buddha and Hatthaka. He once saw the Buddha at Gomagga in Simsapavana, near Alavi, and asked him if he were one of those who lived happily. The Buddha said he was always happy in any circumstances (A.i.136f). On another occasion the Buddha asked Hatthaka how he could command the allegiance of such a large company. &quot;By the four bases of sympathy,&quot; he answered,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;by giving gifts, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;by kindly words,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;by kindly deeds,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;by equality of treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when Hatthaka had gone, the Buddha praised him for his eminence, in that he possessed eight marvellous qualities:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;faith,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;virtue,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;conscientiousness,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;fear of blame,  &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;ability to listen well,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;charity,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;wisdom,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;modesty. (A.iv.218f; his modesty is especially mentioned elsewhere also e.g., at A.iv.216).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/citta')"&gt;Citta-gahapati&lt;/a&gt;, Hatthaka is often held up as an example to be copied by others. (E.g., at S.ii.235; A.i.88; ii.164; iii.451, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death, Hatthaka was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avihaa')"&gt;Avihá&lt;/a&gt;, there to pass away entirely. From there he once visited the Buddha and tried to stand in his presence, but collapsed and could not remain upright. The Buddha then asked him to create a gross body form, and when he did this he was able to stand. He told the Buddha that he was constantly surrounded by devas wishing to learn the Dhamma from him, and confessed that he had died regretting three things - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of not having seen enough of the Buddha, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of not heard enough of the Dhamma, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;of not served enough the Sangha (A.i.278f).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Buddhavamsa (Bu.xxvi.19), Citta and Hatthakálavaka are mentioned as the chief lay patrons (aggupattháká) of Gotama Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The king had a lake, called Khemá, dug outside the city, and put into it various kinds of food in order to entice the golden geese which lived in Cittakúta. They came, led by Dhatarattha the Bodhisatta, who was caught in the snare laid by the king's hunter. The Bodhisatta gave the alarm, and all the geese fled except Sumukha, his captain, who refused to leave him even though told to do so. When the hunter came, Sumukha persuaded him to let Dhatarattha free and to take him instead. The hunter agreed, but when the Bodhisatta heard of the reason for his capture, he, too, insisted on going before the king. Both geese were, therefore, led before the king, who was overjoyed. Dhatarattha preached the Law and the queen's craving was appeased; the geese were then allowed to fly away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Ananda's readiness to give his life for the Buddha.

His chaplain, hearing that the deity of a certain banyan tree had the power of giving sons, went to the tree and threatened to cut it down unless Esukárí had a son. The tree deity consulted Sakka, who persuaded four devas to be born as the sons, not of Esukárí, but of his chaplain. On the day when the chaplain came to cut down the tree, the deity told him of Sakka's decision, and also warned him that the sons would not live the household life. In due course the sons were born and were named Hatthipála, Gopála, Assapála and Ajapála. Various devices were adopted to prevent them from turning to the ascetic life. But when Hatthipála grew up he insisted on leaving home and becoming an ascetic, heedless of the entreaties both of his father and of Esukárí. His brothers, when their time came, acted in the same way. Later, their parents joined them. The king sent for all their wealth, but the queen, being wise, made him realize by means of a simile the folly of such an act. Together they left the world and joined Hatthipála and his family. The citizens followed their example till the whole city was empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatthipála preached to them and they all became ascetics. His company covered an area of thirty leagues, and with it he went to the Himálaya, where Vissakamma, acting under Sakka's orders, built for them a hermitage extending over thirty six leagues, on the bank's of the Ganges. Soon after, other kings who, with their followers, had gone, one after another, to take Benares, realizing their folly, joined Hatthipála and became ascetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Buddha's Great Renunciation.

His contribution to the cause of Buddhism in general and to the Great Vehicle in particular is immense. For these and many other reasons he is held by the Chinese Buddhists in the highest esteem among the pilgrims of his calibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following information on Hsúan-tsang's travels and his accounts of India and other countries which he travelled in his long journey is based mainly on two sources, namely, &quot;Si-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World&quot; an English translation of the Chinese version of Hsúan-tsang and &quot;The Life of Hiuen-tsiang&quot; an English translation of his biography written in Chinese by Shaman Hwui-li, a disciple of his. Among secondary sources the most useful treatise is 'On Yuan Chwang's Travels in India', a critical study written by Thomas Watters in 1961. This work is based on Hsúan-tsang's Hsi-Yu-Shi (or Si-Yu-Ki) also entitled Buddhist Records of the Western World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsúan-tsang was born in 603 A.C. in Chin-lu in the reign of Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty and lived about sixty-five years. Opinions, however, differ regarding the exact years of his birth and death. His secular name was Ch'en-Chin and he was the youngest of four brothers. His father was Ch'en-hui who devoted himself to the study of Confucious' teachings. Even as a child Hsúan-tsang was unusually of grave temperament and intelligence. He did not enjoy the company of boys of his age nor did he appreciate their life style. His second brother, Chang-tse who had entered the Order previously took Hsúan-tsang to his own convent and made </data>
<data>arrangements to impart instruction to him there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsúan-tsang (= Ht.) was so studious that at times he studied without sleep and even food. At one hearing he is said to have comprehended a book thoroughly and after a second reading needed no further instruction. At the age of eleven he was versed in the Saddharmapundarika Sutra and the Vimalakirtinirdesa. At the age of thirteen he was admitted into the Order and was engaged in further studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political situation in the country being unsatisfactory the two brothers went to Chang'an and from there again to Ch'eng-tu, the capital of Shu. There Hsúan-tsang followed lectures on the scriptures delivered by eminent scholars and in a few years he mastered the scriptures of various schools and earned a name as a scholar. It was about this time or a few years later that he came to be known by the appellation &quot;The Master of the Law&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fifth year of Wu-te he received full ordination at Ch'eng-tu. He went to Chin-chow for further studies where he also conducted sermons as an advanced student. Scholar monks who gathered there as listeners treated him with great respect and admiration. Thereupon he went to Chaochow, Hsiang-chow and Ch'ang-an and studied the Samyuktábhidharma-hrdaya, the Maháyána-sangraha, the Abhidharma-kosa etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short time Ht. mastered all the theories of the different schools of Buddhism and was acclaimed as a great scholar. He found that Buddhist teachings he had learned, mainly those concerned with the theory of Dharmalaksana and the views held by the propounders of the Maháyána-Sangraha and those held by the followers of the Dasabhúmivyákarana were at variance. Moreover, he discerned many defects in the Chinese translations of the sacred books, and consequently he cherished the idea of going to India to </data>
<data>learn at the feet of orthodox scholars. In this he was inspired to some extent by his forerunners Fa-hsien and Chi-yen who undertook similar tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overcoming many obstacles Ht., at the age of twenty-six years set forth from Chang-an and going through several provinces or countries came to Liang-chow where he received a companion to travel to the West. Despite the attempts of spies to detain him the governor of the province, Li-chiang, however, let him proceed on his journey. Some of the territories or countries which he traversed until he reached the borders of North India were Turfan (Kau-chang), Agni (O-ki-ni), Kuche (Kiuchi) an oasis in the Gobi desert, Nujkend (Nu-chin-kien), Chaf (Che-shi), Ferghanah (Fei-han in Turkestan), Sutrishna (Su-tu-Ii-sse-na), Samarkhand (Sa-mo-kien), Kesh (Ki-shwang-na), Kunduz (Hwo), Bhaktra or Bactria (Fo-ho-lo), Bamiyam (Fan-yen-na) and Kapisa (Kia-pi-she).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His journey was beset with dangers and hardships. As the only guide given him to accompany until the last of the watch towers in sandy desert also deserted him he went on all alone. The worst experience encountered was in the heart of the Mo-kia-yen desert which extended for 800 li. One hundred li after entering the desert he lost his way. By accident his water bag gave way without leaving a drop of water in it and he had to spend four nights and five days in the desert without water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a later stage when wending their way up the snow-clad Ling mountain, and the snowy mountain (Hindukush) lying to the south of Balkh, twelve or fourteen of his companions and an even greater number of oxen and horses met with death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obstacles caused by robbers on his way to India and also in India itself were more than embarrassing. Even governors or kings of certain countries embarrassed him as he was proceeding towards India. </data>
<data>Although very hospitable and respectful to Ht. the king of Kam-chang, Khio-wen-tai planned to detain him in his court as his spiritual head. Ht. got out of this grip only by the threat of fasting unto death. Another attempt to detain him was made by the Great Khan of the Turks. As will appear below, Ht. underwent another such experience in Eastern India as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the countries which were traversed by Ht. on his way to North India, Bhaktra (Po-ho-lo), Bamiyan (Fanyen-na) and Kapisa (Kia-pi-she) were active centres of Buddhism. According to Ht, there were about three thousand monks of the Little Vehicle in Bhaktra. There was a scholar monk called Prajñákara who was versed in the three pitakas of the Little Vehicle. Ht. was pleased with his explanation of the doctrine of that school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ht. reached Bamiyan crossing Hindu-kush. In both Bamiyan and Kapisa, there were several thousand monks of the Little Vehicle. In Bamiyan there were three imposing figures of the Buddha. One of these was a standing figure of about 140 or 150 feet high. Another figure of the standing Buddha measures 100 feet in height. An enormous figure of the recumbent Buddha depicting his 'Nirvana' measures 1000 feet in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a conference held in a temple of the Great Vehicle in Kapisa Ht. being thorough with the teachings of both schools, proved his superiority over all who participated in it. From Kapisa onwards his itinerary covered territories in North India of which the following place names are graphed by Ht. into a separate unit. Lamghan (Lanpo), Nagarahara (Na-kie-to-ho), Gandhara (Kien-to-lo), Udyana (U-chang), Takshasila (Ta-ch'a-shi-lo), Urasa (Wu-la-sa), Kashmir (Kia-shi-mi-lo), Punach (Pun-nuh-t'so) and Rajapuri (Ho-lo-she-pu-lo). According to Ht, common people in the above territories differ to some extent from those of India in respect of manners, clothing and </data>
<data>language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Si-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World (Records) ed. Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1981, Bk. II, pp. 68, 917; The Life of Hiuen Tsiang (=The Life) ed. Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1973, pp. 57-72. The countries from Lamgham to Rajapuri both inclusive were not regarded by the people of India proper as forming parts of their territory (Watters, Thomas, On Yuang Chwang's Travels in India, pub. Munshi Ram Manohar Lal, Oriental Publishers and Booksellers, Delhi, 1961, p. 180, (Abbreviated as Watters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagarahara (Jelalabad) occupies a prominent place as a country possessing Buddha's relics. In Nagarahara or its neighbourhood Ht. rejoined his companions and went to Gandhara by the Khyber Pass. He gives the names of a number of sages and saints who composed sástras there. Then he goes to describe the famous stupa of 400 feet in height ascribed to king Kanishka. It was situated in Purushapura (Po-lu-shu-po-lo), the capital of Gandhara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either side of the river Subhavastu (Su-po-fa-sa-tu) in the country of Udyana is said by Ht. to have been thickly populated by Buddhists in former days. At the time of his visit he saw the country depopulated. The few monks who were there at the time belonged to five different schools viz. the Dharmaguptas, the Mahisásakas, the Kasyapiyas, the Sarvástivadins and the Mahásanghikas. Among the objects of worship are mentioned figures of Avalokitesvara and Maitreya bodhisattva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Takshasila, Urasa and Kashmir, too, he saw various Buddhist sites. The chief monk in Kashmir was of high moral character and of remarkable intelligence. This monk explained many parts of the doctrine to him. This learned teacher was so impressed by Ht. that the latter was compared to Asanga bodhisattva in respect of his wisdom. According to Ht.&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaniska')"&gt;Kanishka&lt;/a&gt;, convened an assembly, known to history </data>
<data>as the Fourth Council, in the four hundredth year from the 'Nirvana' of the Tathágata. Ht. stayed for two years studying sutras and sástras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving Kashmir Ht. made his way to Punach and from there to Rajapuri. From Rajapuri he entered a different zone in North India arriving at Takka (Teheka) as its starting point. To the east of the town called Narasimha (Na-lo-sang-ho) he and the accompanying sámaneras encountered a band of fifty robbers who robbed them of their belongings. However, a brahmin in the neighbourhood came to their help and they managed to escape with no loss of life. There he remained for one month, and for fourteen months in the kingdom of Chinapati (Chi-na-po-tai) studying various texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before reaching the next important kingdom, Mathura (Mo-t'u-lo) he passed through the kingdoms of Jalandhara (She-lan-t'o-lo), Kuluta (Kiu-la-ta), Satadra (Shete-to-lu) and Paryatra (Po-li-ye-to-to). An interesting custom of making offerings in honour of the disciples of the Buddha is said to have prevailed in Mathura. The followers of Abhidhamma made offerings in honour of Sáriputta, those who practised meditation....... in honour of Maudgalyáyana, the students of the sutras...... in honour of Purnamaitráyaniputra, the followers of the Vinaya..... in honour of Upáli, the bhikkhunis..... in honour of Ananda, the Srámaneras.... in honour of Ráhula and followers of the Great Vehicle.... in honour of bodhisattvas (Watters, pp. 302, 303; The Life, p. 77).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Mathura he visited Matipuram (Ma-ti-pu-lo) which was ruled by a king of the Súdra caste. He makes reference to Gunaprabha the author of Tattvavibhanga Sástra and to a learned doctor called Sanghabbadra who was versed in the Vibhásá of the Sarvistiváda school and who composed the Kosa-káriká. Ht. stayed there for a few months and studied various texts under </data>
<data>the eminent monk called Mitrasena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his way to Kapitha (Kis-pi-tha) also called Sankassa he had to go past Brahmapura (P'o-lo-hih-mo-pu-lo), Ahikshetra ('O-hi-shi-to-lo) and Virásana (Pi-to-shanna). Proceeding two hundred li towards north-west from Kapitha he reached Kanauj or Kányakubja (Kie-jo-kio-she-kwo). Its capital borders on the Ganges on the West. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watters argues that the direction shown in the text is wrong and it should be South East. He also argues that the river in question is not the Ganges but a tributary of that river (Waiters, p. 340; cp. also Records, Bk. V. p. 207.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a busy centre of Buddhism and there were ten thousand monks who studied both vehicles very ardently. His account on Harsavardhana or Harsha also called Siláditya is of immense historical value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries from Ayodhyá (O-yo-t'o) to Hiranya parvata (I-lam-na-po-fa-to) constitute another phase of his long pilgrimage. Six hundred li to the south-east from Kanauj is Ayodhya. Several thousand monks there studied both vehicles, and it is here that Vasubandhu and Asanga carried out their literary activities. When Ht. and his companions were going from Ayodhya to Hayamukha ('O-ye-mu-khi) along the course of the Ganges a gang of pirates took the crew captive. As worshippers of goddess Durga the pirates were looking out for a man of good form and comely features for sacrificing to the goddess. They earmarked Ht. as the most suitable person for the purpose and were about to kill him. Suddenly a typhoon arose smiting down the trees. Clouds of sand flew on every side and the lashing waves of the river tossed the boats to and fro. The pirates getting terrified at the calamity thought that it all happened due to the spiritual power of Ht, and came down in repentance and confessed their fault.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;After this nasty experience Ht. went to Hayamukha and from there to Prayága (Po-lo-ye-kia). He describes Prayága, the confluence of two rivers, Gangá and Yamuná and the level ground of about fourteen li in circuit, to the West. From Prayága he set out for Kausambi (Kiau-shang-mi) where he saw many sangháramas, stúpas and a sandalwood image of the Buddha fashioned by king Udayana. According to Ht, there were about three thousand monks belonging to the Sammitiya school of the Little Vehicle in the Kingdom of Visákha (Pi-so-kia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Srávasti, the next important Buddhist centre he visited, there were several hundred sanghárámas belonging to the Sammitiya school. Sites connected with various incidents are described: for instance, the spot on which Angulimála gave up his evil acts and was converted, the convent where Brahmacári heretics killed a woman and accused the Buddha of her murder, the venue in which the Buddha defeated all the heretics, the place where the Buddha met his father, king Suddhodana, for the first time since Enlightenment and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Srávasti he went to Kapilavastu (Kie-pi-lo-fa-sutu) where the capital as well as some thousand villages were in a state of ruin. There he saw old foundations of the main palace of Suddhodana and the sleeping quarters of Queen Máyá etc. Hsúan-tsang's account of Kapilavastu and Kusinagara (Kushi-na-kie-lo) or Kusinárá is replete with accounts of the life of the Buddha before and after his Enlightenment, for example the place of his birth, prophetic pronouncement, sites of the Four Signs, Parinirvána etc. According to Ht. the contemporary tradition has it that the Buddha's Nirvina' took place on the fifteenth day of the latter half of the month of Vaisákha. The Sarvástivádins held that it took place during the second half of the month of Kártika i.e. November.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Referring to the kingdom of Banaras or Báránasi (Po-lo-ni-sse) he speaks of two schools of monks, one belonging to the Sarvástiváda and the other to the Sammitiya school both belonging to the Little Vehicle. Important sites such as the venue of the Buddha's first sermon and his washing tank are mentioned in his account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Báránasi he went to Ghazipur (Chen-chu) and then to Vaisáli. There the capital city was in a state of devastation and ruin. The inhabitants at the time of his visit were very few in number. In a sangháráma there the Buddha is said to have recited the Vimalakirti Sutra. Three important places relating to his Parinirvana are also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his way to Magadha (Mo-kie-to) he stopped at the town of Svetapura where he obtained the sútra called the Bodhisattva-pitaka. He had a high esteem for the people of Magadha. According to him there were about ten thousand monks mostly belonging to the Great Vehicle in Magadha. The capital of Magadha was desolate and in ruins. According to Ht. Asoka held a convocation of a thousand monks at a monastery called Kukkutáráma. This is an allusion to the Third Council held under the patronage of King Asoka. The monastery in question is named as Asokáráma in the Dipavamsa and the Mahávamsa, the two ancient Pali chronicles of Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to Nairañjána and other important sites at Bodhgayá he mentions various beliefs regarding the Vajrásana. One such belief holds that the site of the Vajrásana was the centre of the universe. He says that the Bo-tree had been continually cut down and destroyed by the members of the royalty. Elsewhere he refers to one king named Sasánka of Karnasuvarna in Eastern India who destroyed the Bo-tree (Records Bk. viii, p. 121). The following account of Ht. regarding the Bo-tree seems interesting in respect of rituals which developed in later times. &quot;The Bo-tree sheds its leaves </data>
<data>when the day of the Nirvana approaches and tender leaves begin to grow after this day. Every year on that day kings, ministers and magistrates pour milk on its roots, light lamps, scatter flowers and they go away collecting leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account on the Nálandá monastery gives some idea about its academic activities, maintenance, academic staff and student population, curriculum and residential quarters. It says that after the &quot;Nirvana&quot; of the Buddha an old king of that country called Sakráditya built this convent out of his great attachment for the Buddha. By the time of Ht.'s visit it had been about 700 years since its establishment. Thus its founding dates back to 1st century B.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His purpose of going to Nálandá was to learn the principles of the Yoga-sastra, The chief monk Silabhadra admitted Ht. as his disciple. Among the students there were many foreigners. According to Ht. of all the sanghárámas of India Nálandá Monastery was the most remarkable for its grandeur and height. Resident students numbered ten thousand. They studied the teachings of all the eighteen schools and also subjects such as the Vedas, the Hetuvidyá, Sabdavidyá, the Cikitsávidyá, the works on magic (Atharvaveda) and the Sánkhya system. There were 1541 scholars who were versed in various branches of study. Within the temple hundred pupils were being arranged every day for preaching and students attended these and participated in discussions without fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the source of income of the Nálandá monastery Ht. tells us that there was a farm-house belonging to the monastery. The account does not say anything about the way in which the farm was run and how the income accrued to the monastery. There were other sources of income too. According to Ht. the king of the country remitted the revenue of about hundred villages for the endowment of the convent. Two hundred house </data>
<data>holders in these villages contributed rice, butter and milk daily. Hence students had no complaints to make about their requisites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Rájagrha he locates many important sites connected with various episodes; for instance, the site of the stupa where Devadatta in conjunction with Ajátasatru rájá let loose the drunken elephant with intent to kill the Buddha. Referring to the Grdhrakúta (Ki-li-to-lo-kiu) it is said that while residing there the Buddha declared the Saddharmapundarika (Fa-hwa), the Maháprajñá (Tapan-jo) and numerous other Sutras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His account on the First Council held in Rájagrha is rather misleading. It appears that he has incorporated into it certain details which deal with later councils. According to Ht. the collection of scriptures authorised by the Council came to be called Sthavira collection because Kásyapa (Mahá Kassapa) officiated as the president of the assembly. As regards the emergence of the Mahásanghika school Ht. informs us that monks who were excluded from the Council held by Mahá Kásyapa assembled in Rájagrha and made a collection of the doctrine in five Pitakas, the Sutra Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the Miscellaneous Pitaka and the Dhárani Pitaka. How this assembly got the name Mahásanghika is explained as follows: &quot;As in this assembly there were ordinary persons (Fan-fu) and holy men it was called the Convocation of the Mahásanghikas (The Life, p. 117 cp. Dipavamsa, H. Oldenberg, New Delhi, 1982, 5,30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having visited sacred places in the vicinity of Nálandá Ht. returned to the Nálandá Monastery again and studied several texts such as the Yoga-sastra, the Nyáyánusárasastra, the Hin-hiang-tui-fa-ming, the Hetuvidyá-sastra, the Prányamúla-sastra-tíká and the Sata-sastra. Although he had studied the Kosa-vibhásá and the Satpadábhidharma-sastra in different parts of Kashmir yet he studied them again </data>
<data>at Nálandá Monastery. He also studied Brahman literary works and a grammatical treatise the author of which is not known. On the task of studying the Buddhist and Brahman texts he spent five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next country he visited was Hiranyaparvata (I-lanna-po-fa-to) where he stayed for one year and read the Vibhásá and the Nyáyánusára-sastra etc. From Hiranyaparvata he made his way to the kingdom of Champa where monks followed the Little Vehicle. This country was infested with wild beasts such as the elephant, wolf, rhinoceros and black leopard. Elephants in that country were used for drawing carriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries between Champa (Chen-po) and Samatata (San-to-ch'a) form another phase of his long journey. He visited Hiranya, Kajughira (Ki-shu-ko-kie-lo), Pundravardhana (Pu-na-fa-tan-na) Karnasuvarna (Kielo-na-su-fala-na) before arriving at Samatata. Monks in Pundravardhana belonged to both vehicles whereas those in Karnasuvarna belong to the Little Vehicle of the Sammitiya school. Monks in Karnasurvarna did not use either butter or milk in keeping with the traditional teachings of Devadatta. Immediately after his account on Samatata he refers to Pegu and Siam which, however, lay outside his itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries included in his itinerary in the East and South-east of India were Támralipti (Tan-mo-li-ti), Orissa, Kalinga (Kie-ling-kia), Southern Kosala (Kiao-sa-lo), Andhra (An-to-lo), Dhanakataka (To-na-kie-tse-kia) and Chulya. All these countries had centres of Buddhism. He refers to an entrepot called Caritra (Chi-li-ta-lo) situated on the South-eastern frontier of Orissa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhanakataka, according to Ht. was once a reputed centre of learning, and learned men used to come and dwell there but at the time of his visit it was entirely desolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kingdom of Chulya may be identified </data>
<data>with the Cola Kingdom. He locates the Chulya Kingdom outside the Dravida country. What made him follow this description is not clear. The Cola Kingdom formed part of the Dravida country through the ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next place he visited was the Kingdom of Dravida. The territory occupied by Dravida people could have consisted of several kingdoms or countries, but Ht. refers to it as forming one kingdom. However, the capital of that kingdom is named Kanchipura, the birth place of Dharmapála Bodhisattva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst in Kanchipura Ht. met some three hundred monks from Sinhala. They informed him of the unsettled situation prevailing in Sri Lanka at the time. This dissuaded him from going there. His purpose of going to Sinhala was to get the Tripitaka explained according to the Sthavira school there and also to study the Yoga Sástra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malakúta was the next important place he visited. He refers to Malayagiri which was well-known for sandalwood and the karpúra scented tree. After Malakúta (Mole-kiu-ch'a) he refers to Sinhala again. According to Ht. Sinhala was originally called Po-chu as it had many gems of a rare character. As for the origin of the Sinhala he narrates with slight variations the legend which traced the origin to a lion king and the murder of the lion by his son. According to Ht. it was the son of the lion who arrived in Po-chu and not his grandson Vijaya as recorded in Sri Lankan chronicles. A second theory about the origin of the Sinhala is narrated as follows: &quot;But it is also said that Sinhala is the name of a merchant's son, who...... came to Po-chu island and slew the Rakshasas and established his capital in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regard to the teachings prevailing in Sri Lanka he adds that monks there follow the teachings of the Great Vehicle and they belong to the school of the sthaviras. He also refers to the schism </data>
<data>which resulted in the division of the Sangha into two factions, the Maháviharavásins who were opposed to the Great Vehicle and the Abhayagirivásins who studied both vehicles. His reference to a mountain named Lankágiri may be the Samantakúta (Adam's Peak) and it was on that mountain the Tathágata delivered the Lankávatára Sutra according to Ht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going two thousand li from Dravida he arrived at Konkanpura (Kin-na-po-lo) and from there to Maharashtra, He tells us that in a vihára at Konkanpura there was a precious head-dress of Prince Siddhártha. With reference to Maharashtra he says that the people of that country were a warlike nation. He cites in evidence the unsuccessful attempt of Siláditya rájá to subjugate Pulakesin. This king may be identified as Pulakesin II (609-642 A.C) of the Chalukyas of Vatapi in the Bijapur District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the countries included in his itinerary to the West and North-west of Narmada were Broach (Baroche), Málava (Mo-la-po), Bráhmanapura (K'ie-ch'a), Vallabhi (Fa-la-pi), Anandapura, Suráshtra (Lasn-c'ha) Gurjjara (Kiu-che-lo), Ujjayin (U-che-yen-na), Chi-ki-to, Mahesvarapura, Surátha, Atyanabakela (O-tin-p'o-chi-lo) and Langala (Lang-kie-lo). The last country is situated near the Great Sea towards the country of western women. If Málavas were the people of Malava or Malwa in Central India as is generally taken the countries named about are not placed in right order. Ujjayini which is the capital of Malwa is named after Surashtra and Gurjjara situated in Gujarat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the countries in India, Ht. had a very high opinion of Málava and Magadha. He says that people of these two countries had the reputation of loving the study of literature, of honouring virtue, of polite language and refined speech. In Málava there were twenty thousand monks studying the teaching of the Sammitiya school of the small </data>
<data>vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are told that going north-west from Langála he went to Persia (Po-la-sse) which, lay outside India. It is said that the bowl (patrá) of the Sakyamuni Buddha was in the royal palace of the country. On its frontier is the city of Ormus (Ho-mo). The countries mentioned next are Babylon? (Fo-lin), an island called the country of the Western women, which is tributary to Fo-lin, Langala, Pitasila (Pi-to-shi-lo), Avanda, Sindh (Sin-tu) Múlasthánapura or Multan (Mu-lo-s'an-po-la) and Parvati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Avanda is to be identified with Avanti in Central India which seems probable in view of his desçriptions of that country, it is difficult to place Avanda on the route followed from Langala to Multan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country called Parvata was noted for renowned scholars. Ht. stayed there for two years and studied the Múlábhidharma-sastra, the Saddharma-samparigrahasástra and the Prasiksásatya-sástra as preserved in the Sammitiya school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Parvata he returned south-eastwardly to Magadha and from there to the Nálandá Monastery. There was in Nálandá a renowned monk called Prajñabhadra who was versed in the Three Pitakas, Sástras etc. Ht. remained there for two years and had his doubts cleared through discussions. He spent two more years studying several branches of study under a renowned lay scholar named Jayasena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is said to have been apprised of the time for his return journey in a dream by Maitreya Bodhisattva. However, he was delayed due to unavoidable circumstances. In the meantime, Silabhadra, the master of sastras at Nálandá deputed Ht. to expound to the congregation there the Maháyána-samparigraha-sastra and to comment on the difficult points of the Vidyá-mátra-siddhi-sastra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About this time Simharasmi and Ht. held two different views about the principles of Yoga. Ht. proved more competent in </data>
<data>the encounter and composed a sastra in three thousand slokas resolving the controversy. This work was later approved for study. At this time further disputes took place between the adherents of the two vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monks in Orissa belittled the Great Vehicle and were used to calling it &quot;Sky Flowers&quot;. But the king of that country had a high regard for the Great Vehicle and challenged the authority of the critics. Monks thereupon requested the king to hold a conference at which they would settle the issue. The controversy does not appear to have taken place at a conference as expected but it came to an end with the compilation of a book which was written by Ht. in refutation of the heretical views held by the monks of Orissa. The way he refuted heretical views made his fame so widespread that king Kumárarája of Karnasuvarna in Eastern India longed to have him as his spiritual head in his kingdom. When Ht. showed his reluctance for the third time the king turned furious and even went to the extent of threatening that he would destroy the whole of Nálandá Monastery in case his request was turned down. Although at last Ht, complied with the request of the king, Siláditya rája's intervention enabled him to get out of another embarrassing situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siláditya rája on his part made arrangements to hold a conference for the exposition of the Great Vehicle and to refute the views of the followers of the Little Vehicle. Princes of eighteen countries were invited to participate in the conference. Renowned Buddhist monks, celebrated Brahmans, heretics, non-believers and secular persons attended the conference. For five days Ht. extolled the teachings of the Great Vehicle and no opponent had any opportunity to assert his views. Adherents of the Little Vehicle learning that their school was shattered plotted to kill him. The king, </data>
<data>however, threatened to behead any one who made an attempt on the life of Ht. It is said that, at the end, large multitudes forsook the Little Vehicle and embraced the Great-Vehicle. When the conference was over Ht. made up his mind to go back to his country. But on a request made to him by Siláditya to witness the quinquennial distribution called 'Mahá moksa parisad' he had to postpone for ten days his return journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his return journey Ht. chose to follow the northern route in order to keep the pledge made by him to the king of Kan-chang that he would visit him on his way back. Getting out from the city of Prayága he took the route which lay across Kausambi, Jalandhara, Simhapura, Taksasilá and the river Indus. The boat laden with ola manuscripts and flower seeds capsized in the Indus and fifty manuscript copies and flower seeds were lost. From there he went past Lamghan (Lan-po), Varna, Avakan, the snowy mountains, Kunduz (Hwoh), Tukhara, Kuran, Bolor and Kashgar up to Khotan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these countries Kashgar and Khotan were renowned centres of the Great Vehicle. Whilst in Khotan he states that he accomplished a journey of more than 50,000 li. His journey through various kingdoms took seventeen years. Here he faced the problem of transporting his books, images and such articles and sent a messenger to Kau-chang asking for help. Seven or eight months later transport facilities were arranged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the books he brought were 224 sutras and 192 sástras of the Great Vehicle; 15 works of the same categories belonging to the Sammitiya School; 22 books of the same belonging to the Mahisásaka school; 67 books.... of the Sthaviravádin school; 17 works.... of the Kásyapiya school; 42 works..... of the Dharmagupta school; 36 copies of the Hetuvidyá Sástra; 13 copies of the Sabdavidyá sastra. Altogether there were 520 </data>
<data>copies comprising 657 volumes carried upon twenty horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he set upon the gigantic task of translating these books into Chinese. For carrying out this project he retired to the monastery of Hong-fu in Si-gan-fu. He completed the translation of 74 distinct works having 1335 chapters. He had moreover made a vast number of pictures and wrote with his own hands copies of various sutras. When all these works had been finished he closed his eyes and lay perfectly still. &quot;Having recited some verses in adoration of Maitreya, he gradually sank until the day of his demise on the 10th March, the 13th day of the year 664.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsúan-tsang's travel accounts which appear in the foregoing description furnish information on a wide variety of subjects. Some of these such as physical barriers, the relative distribution of the centres of the Little and the Great Vehicle in and outside India, Buddhist monuments, hospitality shown in different countries, conferences, religious encounters have been surveyed in brief in the above account. Apart from these he presents a wealth of information on a wide range of subjects such as economic, educational and social conditions, religious practices, mannerism, customs administration and so on. He enumerates a number of ways of showing respect and paying homage that was prevalent among the people of India. Some such forms are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(i) greeting with a kind of enquiry;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(ii) reverently bowing the head;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(iii) raising the hands to the head   with an inclination of the body; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(iv) bowing with hands folded on the   chest; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(v) bending a knee; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(vi) kneeling down; &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(vii) going down on the ground on   hands and knees; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(viii) bowing down with knees, elbows   and forehead to the ground and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(ix) prostrating oneself on the   ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the general education meant for Indians he describes that children in the beginning followed the 'Twelve Chapters' and at the age of seven they began to study the great treatises of the 'Five Sciences'. Some idea of Buddhist education may be gained from his description of Nálandá referred to earlier, But his estimation of the Brahmanic system of educating beginners is very high. Regarding the Brahmanic teachers he says: &quot;These teachers explain the general meaning and teach them minutely, they rouse them to activity and skilfully win them over to progress, they instruct the inert and sharpen the dull. When disciples intelligent and acute are addicted to idle shirking the teachers doggedly persevere repeating instruction until their training is finished.....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ht. states that differences among various schools of Buddhism were seen in their tenets and also in customs. According to Ht. different schools had their own tenets, and controversies ran high. As a result each of the eighteen schools claimed that each system was intellectually superior to others. Tenets of the Great and the Little systems differed widely. Certain concessions and gains were accorded to monks in keeping with their knowledge and where the spiritual attainments were high the distinctions conferred were extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the three robes allowed for monks as their costume he narrates that different schools adhered to different styles having broad or narrow fringes and small or large folds. Ht.'s description about wearing sangháti (seng-kio-ki) conforms to the present day </data>
<data>practice of its wearing by monks in Sri Lanka and other Theraváda countries. As for the antaravása, (ni-po-so-na) the undergarment, he says that it was worn without a belt. Rather it was made into plaits and then secured by one of these plaits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding social organisation Ht. informs us that society consists of four caste groups. These four castes form classes of various degrees of ceremonial purity. The members of a caste marry within the caste. Relatives whether by the father's or mother's side do not intermarry and a woman never contracts a second marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the character of the Indian people he tells us that they were of hasty and irresolute temperament but of pure moral principles. They fear retribution for sins in future lives and take lightly their plight in the present life. They keep their sworn obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His account on law and punishment too, is interesting. According to him the offenders who violate statute law were imprisoned for life. For offences against social morality, disloyalty and unfilial conduct the punishment was mutilation or banishment of the offender out of the country or into the wilderness. Other offences can be atoned for by paying a fine. He also describes the four ordeals by which the innocence or guilt of an accused person is determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For offences against the Vinaya, the community of brethren has a gradation of penalties. If the offence was slight a reprimand was ordered and the punishment became harsh according to the gravity of the offence. Expulsion from the community was the worst punishment meted out to the most serious offender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the disposal of the dead and the performance of the last rites, there were three recognised customs. The first of these was cremation. The second was water burial, the corpse being put into a </data>
<data>stream to float and dissolve. The third was burial in the wilderness, the body being cast away in the woods to be eaten up by wild animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist brethren were forbidden to wail aloud over a departed one. On the death of a parent they read a service of gratitude to secure for the deceased person bliss in the next life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are to depend on the records left by Ht. certain kings of the Gupta dynasty have patronised Buddhism. According to him Purugupta Vikrama Prakásáditya, a brother of Skandagupta, Narasimhagupta Baláditya, son and successor of Purugupta, Tathágatarája Vainyagupta, another son of Purugupta and Vajira, a son of Narasimhagupta Baláditya patronised Buddhism. All these kings contributed to the promotion of Buddhist learning by building monastic establishments at Nálandá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ht. the worship of relics was widely practised in many Buddhist countries traversed by him and among these the most popular was the cult of the Tooth Relic of the Buddha. It was prevalent in Bhaktra; in an unnamed temple of a small valley situated to the east of the snowy mountain; Kashmir and Simbala. The next popular Buddhist cult was that of the Bowl-relic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purusapura, the capital of Gandhára as well as Persia are mentioned as countries where the Bowl-relic was venerated. The following objects too were venerated: the sweeping brush made of kusa grass in Bhaktra, the skull-bone at Hidda (Kilo of Fa-hsien) in Nagarahara (Jelalabad), the eye ball, the sangháti robe, and the staff at the same site and the garment washing stone obtained in Udyána. A strong tradition about the Buddha presenting pieces of his nails and some hair to two merchants who offered him honey and rice cake is recorded by Ht. with regard to Bhaktra (The Life p.50). This is evidently based on the account in the Vinays Mahávagga where two merchants play </data>
<data>a similar role at Bodh Gaya though no reference is made there to the presentation of nails to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his way to India he passed through countries where Buddhism did not have adherents. Two such countries were Kan-chang and Sa-mo-kien. He succeeded in propagating Buddhism in those countries by delivering effective sermons. In the latter some devotees were so taken up with the teachings that they even entered the Buddhist Order. It was partly due to his evangelist endeavours that Buddhism which lay dormant after the age of the Guptas began to flourish during the reign of Harshavardhana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/images/hsuen_tsang.jpg"&gt;Picture of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/images/hsuen_tsang.jpg"&gt;Hiuen Tsiang&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The girl tried to seduce the young ascetic when his father was away and take him back with her to the haunts of men, but he told her to go on, saying that he would follow after taking leave of his father. When the latter heard his story and learnt his intention, he exhorted the youth not to be ensnared by thoughts of lust. His son realized his folly and remained in the hermitage.

It was repaired by Parakkamabáhu II. Vijayabáhu III. was cremated near the vihára, and Parakkamabáhu II. built there a cetiya and an octagonal image house which contained a stone image of the Buddha (Cv.lxxxv.73f). It is said that a king, named Upatissa, had built in the monastery a five storeyed pásáda in honour of a monk who made the earth and sky resound with thunder at the moment of his attainment of arahantship. Parakkamabáhu II. found it fallen into decay and had it restored in his name. His minister, Devappatirája, erected, in the king's name, a three storeyed pásáda, gave it to Anomadassí Thera, who was chief incumbent of the vihára at that time, and set up a stone inscription to record the gift.

A water snake, looking for fish, fell into a wicker cage set by men to catch fish. The fishes, seeing the snake, bit him till he fled, dripping with blood. Exhausted, he lay on the edge of the water. Seeing the Green Frog at the mouth of the cage, the snake asked him if the fish had done right in attacking him. &quot;Why not?&quot; asked the Frog; &quot;you eat fish which get into your place and they eat you when you get into theirs.&quot; The fish, hearing this, fell upon the snake and did him to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Ajátasattu’s war with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;.

It is one of the seven mountain ranges surrounding Gandhamádana (SNA.i.66).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is three hundred thousand leagues in extent (SNA.i.224), with eighty four thousand peaks its highest peak being five hundred yojanas (SNA.ii.443) In Himavá, are seven great lakes, each fifty leagues in length, breadth and depth - Anotatta, Kannamunda, Rathakára, Chaddanta, Kunála, Mandákiní and Síhappapátaka; these lakes are never heated by the sun (A.iv.101; SNA.ii.407; cf. AA.ii.759). From Himavá flow five hundred rivers. SNA.ii.437; but according to Mil.114, only ten of these are to be reckoned, the others flowing only intermittently. These ten are:  Gangá, Yamuná, Aciravatí, Sarabhú, Mahí, Sindhu, Sarassatí, Vettavatí, Vítamsá and Candabhágá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In numerous Játakas Himavá is mentioned as the place to which ascetics retire when they leave household life. It is full of woodlands and groves, suitable for hermits (E.g., SA.i.265). In Himavá is a peak named Mahápapáta where Pacceka Buddhas die (SNA.i.129). Nágas go to Himavá to give birth to their young (SA.iii.120; cf. S.v.63). The mountain is often used in similes; it is then referred to as pabbatarájá (E.g., S.ii.137; v.464; A.iii.311; M.iii.166, etc.). Sívalí Thera once went there from Sávatthi with five hundred others. The journey took them eight days. (Details are given at ThagA.ii.138; PSA.252).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country round Himavá was converted by Majjhima Thera (Mhv.xii.41). He was accompanied by four others: Kassapagotta, Múladeva (Alakadeva), Sahadeva and Dundubhissara (Dpv.viii.10; MT.317). Majjhima preached the Damma-cakka-ppavattana Sutta and eighty crores attained salvation. These five Theras converted five kingdoms and each ordained one hundred thousand persons </data>

The Buddha took the Sákyan princes there and showed them the various features, including many mountain peaks, such as: Manipabbata, Hingulapabbata, Añjanapabbata, Sánupabbata, and Phalikapabbata (J.v.415). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On fast days the gods assemble in Himavá and hold discourses.
