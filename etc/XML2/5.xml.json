It was regarded in the Buddha's time as one of the six great cities of India, the others being Camp\u00e1, R\u00e1jagaha, S\u00e1vatthi, Kosamb\u00ed and Benares (D.ii.146). It was probably the older capital of Kosala, and is mentioned as such in the Nandiyamiga J\u00e1taka. J.iii.270; cf. Mtu.i.348, 349, 350, where it is called the capital of King Suj\u00e1ta of the S\u00e1kyan race. See also the Kumbha J\u00e1taka (J.ii.13), where S\u00e1keta is mentioned as one of the places into which alcohol was introduced quite soon after its discovery by Sura and Varuna. According to the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1rada Kassapa J\u00e1taka (J.vi.228), it was the birthplace of Bijaka, aeons ago. In this context it is called S\u00e1ket\u00e1. According to a tradition, recorded in the Mah\u00e1vastu, S\u00e1keta was the city from which S\u00e1kyan princes were exiled when they founded Kapilavatthu. E. J. Thomas accepts this view (op. cit., 16f.).</p><p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.386), however, states that the city was founded in the Buddha's time by Dhana\u00f1jaya, father of Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1, when, at the special invitation of Pasenadi, he went from R\u00e1jagaha to live in Kosala. On the way to S\u00e1vatthi with Pasenadi, Dha\u00f1anjaya pitched his camp for the night, and learning from the king that the site of the camp was in Kosalan territory and seven leagues from S\u00e1vatthi, Dhana\u00f1jaya obtained the king's permission to found a city there. And because the site was first inhabited in the evening (s\u00e1yam), the city came to be called S\u00e1keta. The Divy\u00e1vad\u00e1na (211) has another explanation of the name, in connection with the coronation of Mandh\u00e1t\u00e1 (Svayam \u00e1gatam svayam \u00e1gatam S\u00e1keta S\u00e1ketam iti sa\u00f1jn\u00e1 samvrtt\u00e1).</p><p>The reference is probably to a new settlement established by Dhana\u00f1jaya in the old city.</p><p>We also learn from the Visuddhimagga (p.390; but see", "below) that the distance from S\u00e1keta to S\u00e1vatthi was seven leagues (yojanas), and there we are told that when the Buddha, at the invitation of C\u00fala subhadd\u00e1, went from S\u00e1vatthi to S\u00e1keta, he resolved that the citizens of the two cities should be able to see each other. In the older books (E.g., Vin.i.253) however, the distance is given as six leagues. The town lay on the direct route between S\u00e1vatthi and Patitth\u00e1na, and is mentioned (SN.vss.1011 1013) as the first stopping place out of S\u00e1vatthi. The distance between the two places could be covered in one day, with seven relays of horses (M.i.149), but the books contain several references (E.g., Vin.i.88, 89, 270; iii.212; iv. 63, 120) to the dangers of the journey when undertaken on foot. The road was infested with robbers, and the king had to maintain soldiers to protect travellers.</p><p>Midway between S\u00e1keta and S\u00e1vatthi was Toranavatthu, and it is said (S.iv.374 ff) that, when Pasenadi went from the capital to S\u00e1keta, he spent a night in Toranavatthu, where be visited Khem\u00e1 Ther\u00ed who lived there. Between S\u00e1keta and S\u00e1vatthi was a broad river which could be crossed only by boat (Vin.iv.65, 228). Near S\u00e1keta was the A\u00f1janavana, where the Buddha sometimes stayed during his visits to S\u00e1keta and where he had several discussions   e.g., with Kakudha (S.i.54), Mendasira (q.v.), and Kundaliya (S.v.73; see also K\u00e1laka Sutta and Jar\u00e1 Sutta and S\u00e1keta Sutta).</p><p>On other occasions he stayed at the K\u00e1lak\u00e1r\u00e1ma (A.ii.24) gifted to the Order by K\u00e1laka(q.v.), and the Tikantakivana (A.iii.169), both of which were evidently near the city.

DhA.iii.317f. and Saketa J\u00e1taka) that there lived at S\u00e1keta a brahmin and his wife who, in five hundred lives, had been the parents of the Buddha. When the Buddha visited S\u00e1keta they met him, and, owing to their fondness for him, came to be called Buddhapit\u00e1 and Buddham\u00e1t\u00e1, their family being called Buddhakula.</p><p>According to some accounts (E.g., AA.ii.482; but see C\u00fala-Subhadd\u00e1), An\u00e1thapindika\u2019s daughter, C\u00fala-Subhadd\u00e1, was married to the son of K\u00e1laka, a setthi of S\u00e1keta. K\u00e1laka was a follower of the Niganthas, but he allowed Subhadd\u00e1 to invite the Buddha to a meal. She did this by scattering eight handfuls of jasmine-flowers into the air from her balcony. The Buddha read her thoughts, and went to S\u00e1keta the next day with five hundred arahants. At Sakka's request, Vessavana (Vissakamma?) provided gabled chambers in which the Buddha and his monks travelled by air to S\u00e1keta. At the end of the meal, the Buddha preached to K\u00e1lakasetthi, who became a sot\u00e1panna, and gave the K\u00e1lak\u00e1r\u00e1ma for the use of the monks.</p><p>The Vinaya (Vin.i.270f) mentions another setthi of S\u00e1keta. His wife had suffered for seven years from a disease of the head, and even skilled physicians failed to cure her. J\u00edvaka, on his way to R\u00e1jagaha, after finishing his studies in Takkasil\u00e1, visited S\u00e1keta, heard of her illness, and offered to cure her. At first the setthi was sceptic, but in the end allowed J\u00edvaka to attend on his wife. J\u00edvaka cured her by the administration of ghee", "through the nose, and, as reward, received sixteen thousand kah\u00e1panas from her and her various kinsmen.</p><p>S\u00e1keta, is supposed to be identical with Ayojjh\u00e1 (CAGI. 405), but as both cities are mentioned in the Buddha's time, they are probably distinct. Rhys Davids thinks that possibly they adjoined each other \"like London and Westminster\" (Bud. India, p. 39. See also S\u00e1keta Sutta, S\u00e1keta J\u00e1taka, S\u00e1ketapa\u00f1ha). The site of S\u00e1keta has been identified with the ruins of Suj\u00e1n Kot, on the Sai River, in the Unao district of the modern province of Oudh. The river referred to is probably the Saray\u00fa, which flows into the Gharghara, a tributary of the Ganges.</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Sasankh\u00e1ra Sutta</h2>  </li></ul><p>On four kinds of persons   </p><ul>  <li>one is set free in this life, but after some effort (sasankh\u00e1raparinibb\u00e1y\u00ed);  </li>  <li>another is set free when body breaks up; </li>  <li>a third is set free in this life, without effort;  </li>  <li>a fourth is set free when body breaks up even without   effort.

The first in evidently the well known rule of the Jains against drinking cold water, as it contains \"souls\" (cp. Mil.259ff). The Buddha taught a corresponding fourfold restraint, which consisted of observing the four precepts against injury, stealing, unchastity and lying (D.iii.48f.) </p><p>N\u00e1taputta is also stated (*1) to have claimed omniscience -  to be all-knowing, all seeing, to have all comprising (aparisesa) knowledge and vision. \"Whether I walk or stand or sleep or wake,\" he is mentioned as saying,", "\"my knowledge and vision are always, and without a break, present before me.\"</p><hr><blockquote>  <p>(*1) E.g., M.ii.31; A.i.220; M.i.92f.;also M.ii.214ff.   It is curious, in view of this statement of N\u00e1taputta's doctrine of inaction,   that the main ground on which he is stated to have objected to Siha's visit to   the Buddha, was that the Buddha was an ak\u00edriyav\u00e1d\u00ed (A.iv.180).</p></blockquote><hr><p>He taught that past deeds should be extirpated by severe austerities, fresh deeds should be avoided by inaction. By expelling through penance all past misdeeds and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future became cleared. From the destruction of deeds results the destruction of dukkha; this leads to the destruction of vedan\u00e1. Thus all dukkha is exhausted and one passes beyond (the round of existence). It is said* that N\u00e1taputta did not employ the term kamma in his teaching; he used, instead, the word danda; and that, according to him, the danda of deed was far more criminal than the dandas of word and mind. </p><hr><blockquote>  <p>* M.i.371. Danda probably means sins or hurtful acts.   Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.595ff.) that the Jain idea was that citta (the   manodanda) did not come into bodily acts or into words   which were   irresponsible and mechanical, like the stirring and sighing of boughs in the   wind.</p></blockquote><hr><p>He is said to have shown no hesitation in declaring the destinies of his disciples after death (S.iv.398); but Sakulud\u00e1yi says (M.ii.31; also ibid., i.93; and ii.214f.; the Niganthas admit they did not know of the past) that when asked a question as to the past, he skipped from one matter to another and dismissed the question, evincing irritation, bad temper and resentment.</p><p>Only one discussion is recorded between N\u00e1taputta and a", "follower of the Buddha, and that was with Citta gahapati at Macchik\u00e1 Sanda (S.iv.298ff). He praises Citta at the outset of the discussion, holding him up as an example to his own flock, and agreeing with Citta that knowledge is more excellent than faith. But later, when Citta claims knowledge of the four jh\u00e1nas, N\u00e1taputta is represented as condemning him for a deceitful man. Citta, thereupon, asks him ten questions and, getting no answer, leaves him. The Commentary (SA.iii.99) explains that the questions Citta asked were the same as the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaarapanha')\">Kum\u00e1rapa\u00f1h\u00e1</a>.</p><p>The Devadaha Sutta (M.ii.214; cp. C\u00falla Dukkhakkhandha Sutta; M.i.91ff.;   also A.v.150; D.iii.119), contains a detailed analysis and attributed to the Buddha, of the beliefs and teachings of the Niganthas. He there selects for his condemnation ten of their operative utterances, major and minor, and proves that the efforts and strivings of the Niganthas are fruitless.</p><p>N\u00e1taputta is said (DhA.iii.201) to have claimed miraculous powers, but he did not, in fact, possess them. When, for instance, the R\u00e1jagaha-setthi offered his bowl of red sandal wood to anybody who could remove it from its perch, N\u00e1taputta tried to obtain it by a ruse, but was unable to deceive the setthi.</p><p>The books contain the names of several disciples of N\u00e1taputta, among them a deva called Ninka (S.i.66; the Buddha's own paternal uncle, Vappa, was a follower of the Niganthas). N\u00e1taputta is so convinced of the truth and the irrefutableness of his own doctrines, that he actually encourages his disciples to hold discussions with the Buddha. Some, like D\u00edgha Tapass\u00ed, come away unscathed, without having carried the discussion to any conclusion; others are mentioned as being convinced by the Buddha in the end and as becoming his disciples. Such, for instance, are Asibandhakaputta (S.iv.317ff) and", "Abhayar\u00e1jakum\u00e1ra (M.i.392ff). N\u00e1taputta tries, without success, to dissuade S\u00edha, general of the Licchavis, from visiting the Buddha (A.iv.180ff). S\u00edha goes and is converted. The next day he holds an almsgiving, on a grand scale, to the Buddha and his monks, at which flesh is served. It is said that N\u00e1taputta went about Ves\u00e1li, sneering at the Buddha for encouraging slaughter. The Buddha, hearing of this, relates the Telov\u00e1da J\u00e1taka (J.ii.262f.; Vin.i.233ff), to show that in the past, too, N\u00e1taputta had sneered at him for a similar reason. N\u00e1taputta is identified with the rich man of the J\u00e1taka. In the B\u00e1veru J\u00e1taka (J.iii.126f) he is identified with the crow who lost all his honour and glory when approached by the peacock, who was the Bodhisatta.</p><p>But the greatest blow to N\u00e1taputta was when Up\u00e1li-gahapati (M.i.373ff) joined the Buddha. N\u00e1taputta had allowed Up\u00e1li to visit him in spite of the warning of D\u00edgha-Tapass\u00ed as to the Buddha's arresting personality. But N\u00e1taputta thought Up\u00e1li would be proof against it, and, on hearing that he had renounced his allegiance to the Niganthas, refused to believe it until he could verify the information himself. The discovery of the apostasy of Up\u00e1li prostrated him with grief; he vomited hot blood and had to be carried away on a litter from B\u00e1laka, where he was then living, to P\u00e1v\u00e1. There, soon after, he died, and immediately great dissensions arose among his followers. When the Buddha heard of the quarrels, he remarked that it was only to be expected.</p><p>(Ibid., ii.243f.; D.iii.117, 210; it is stated that the quarrel was deliberately fostered by N\u00e1taputta before his death. See Niganth\u00e1).</p><p>Nigantha N\u00e1taputta is the name by which the Jaina teacher, Mah\u00e1v\u00edra, was known to his contemporaries. He was also called Vardham\u00e1na. N\u00e1ta (or N\u00e1ya) was the name of his clan (SNA. (ii.423) says N\u00e1ta was the name of his", "father), which belonged to Ves\u00e1li. According to Jaina tradition, his father's personal name was Siddhatha, and he was a Ksatriya, his mother being Tris\u00e1l\u00e1.

It belonged to a S\u00e1kyan named Nigrodha, who gave it to the Order. In order to convince his proud kinsmen of his attainments, the Buddha performed there the Yamakap\u00e1tih\u00e1riya, and when, at the conclusion of the miracle' a shower of rain fell, wetting only those who wished to be wetted, he related to them the Vessantara J\u00e1taka (Vin.i.82; J.i.88f.;vi.479; BuA.22; DhA.iii.163; also Mtu.iii.101, 107, 114,138,141, 179). It wa's during this visit that Mah\u00e1paj\u00e1pati Gotam\u00ed first asked permission for women to enter the Order. This was refused, and from there the Buddha went on to Ves\u00e1li (Vin.ii.253; A.iv.274). The Buddha stayed at the Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma on several other occasions, and several Vinaya rules are mentioned as being first promulgated there (E.g., Vin.iii.235, 244; iv.55, 101, 167, 181, 262, 314). Various S\u00e1kyans came to see the Buddha at the Nigrodh,\u00e1r\u00e1ma, among them, Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma, Godha, Sarak\u00e1ni, Nandiya and Vappa (S.v.369 78; 395 7, 403 4, 408; A.ii.196; iii.284; iv.220; v. 83, 328, 332, 334). The Buddha himself visited K\u00e1ligodh\u00e1 during his residence there. It was during a discussion with Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma that the Cula Dukkhakkhandha Sutta (q.v.) was preached. During one of the Buddha's residences in Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma, the S\u00e1kyans invited him to consecrate their new Mote Hall, which he did by preaching there far into the night and then asking Moggall\u00e1na to continue his discourse (S.iv.182ff.; also M.i.353, Sekha Sutta). On another occasion the Buddha is mentioned as having spent a period of convalescence at Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma (A.i.219f ); he was there also when the quarrel broke out between the S\u00e1kyans and the", "Koliyans regarding the water of the Rohin\u00ed (SNA.i.357; but see J.v.413, where he is said to have been in S\u00e1vatthi). It seems to have been the Buddha's custom, when staying at Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma, sometimes to spend the noonday siesta in the Mah\u00e1vana near by (E.g., S.iii.91f).</p><p>Among others mentioned as having stayed at Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma are Anuruddha (DhA.iii.295) and Lomasakangiya.

It was probably there that Anuruddha's sister built, at his request, an assembly hall of two storeys for the Sangha (DhA.iii.295f). Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.906; M.iii.109f ) that K\u00e1la Khemaka, the S\u00e1kyan, built a special vih\u00e1ra near Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma, on one side of the grounds.</p><hr><h4>2.

From that time the Buddha declared him foremost among exhorters of the nuns. [A.i.25. The sermon he preached is known as the Nandakovada Sutta (q.v.). The Anguttara Commentary (i.173) says that the nuns were Sakyan maidens who had entered the Order with Pajapati. At first Nandaka was reluctant to preach to them, they having been his wives in a previous birth when he was king, and he feared the calumny of his colleagues who might suggest that he wished to see his former companions. He, therefore, sent another monk in his place; but the Buddha, knowing that only Nanda's preaching would effect the nuns' release, insisted on his going.] </p><p>The Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 (vs.279 82) contains several verses uttered by him to a woman to whom he was once married.

The second discourse is a sermon addressed to the monks at the waiting hall at Jetavana.

When his back began to ache he knocked at the door, and, having entered, told Nandaka that he had been waiting until the end of his discourse to speak to him. Nandaka expressed. his regret that he should have kept the Buddha waiting and pleaded ignorance of his presence. The Buddha, conscious of Nandaka's remorse, went on to praise his sermon, and said that the preaching of such sermons was the duty of all pious monks. When the Buddha left, Nandaka resumed his sermon, and told his audience of the five results of listening to the Dhamma in due season.</p><p>The Majjhima Commentary (ii.1019) states that Nandaka was once the leader of a guild of five hundred slaves of Benares and that Pajapati Gotami was his wife.

On enquiry, she learnt that they had applied to a merchant for lodgings for the rainy season, but that he had been unable to help. She undertook the care of them and, having enlisted the support of all her", "companions and their husbands, she and her husband ministered to the Pacceka Buddhas. As a result, they were born together as man and wife for many births, as were their helpers. In one birth Nandaka was king, and all the women became his wives.

Once inside the vih\u00e1ra, however, the Buddha asked Nanda to become a monk, and he, unable to refuse the request, agreed with reluctance.

On the way there, he showed Nanda the charred remains of a female monkey and asked him whether Janapadakaly\u00e1n\u00ed were more beautiful than that. The answer was in the affirmative.

In the time of Atthadassi Buddha he was a tortoise in the river Vinat\u00e1, and, seeing the Buddha on the bank waiting to cross, he took him over to the other side on his back.

Devadatta, after several vain attempts to kill the Buddha, obtained Aj\u00e1tasattu's consent to use N\u00e1lagiri as a means of encompassing the Buddha's death. The elephant, he said, knows nothing of the Buddha's virtues and will have no hesitation in destroying him. N\u00e1lagiri was a fierce animal, and in order to increase his fierceness, Devadatta instructed his keeper to give him twice his usual amount of toddy. Proclamation was made, by the beating of drums, that the streets of the city should be cleared as N\u00e1l\u00e1giri would be let loose upon them. When the Buddha was informed of this and warned against going into the city for alms, he ignored the warning, and went into R\u00e1jagaha with the monks of the eighteen monasteries of the city. At the sight of N\u00e1l\u00e1giri all the people fled in terror. Ananda, seeing the elephant advancing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the Buddha's orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place. Just then, a woman, carrying a child, saw the elephant coming and fled, in her terror dropping the child at the Buddha's feet. As the elephant was about to attack the child, the Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, and, stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal's forehead. Thrilling with joy at the touch, N\u00e1l\u00e1giri sank on his knees before the Buddha, and the Buddha taught him the Dhamma. It is said that had the elephant not been a wild beast he would have become a sot\u00e1panna. Marvelling at the sight, the assembled populace threw all their ornaments on the elephant's body, covering it entirely, and henceforth the elephant was known as Dhanap\u00e1la (Dhanap\u00e1laka). The Buddha returned to Veluvana, and that day, at eventide, preached the Cullahamsa J\u00e1taka", "in praise of Ananda's loyalty to himself (Vin.ii.194f.: J.v.333ff.; Aved\u00e1nas i. 177).

He was the son of Sumana, the eldest of Bimbis\u00e1ra's children, and his mother was Suman\u00e1. When Asoka slew Sumana, his wife, who was with child, fled to a cand\u00e1la village, where the guardian deity of a nigrodha tree built her a hut. Here she gave birth to her son, whom she named after her benefactor. The chief cand\u00e1la looked after them. When Nigrodha was seven years old, the Thera Mah\u00e1varuna ordained him, and he became an arahant in the tonsure hall. One day, while walking near the palace, Asoka saw him and, because of their connection in a past life, was attracted by him. Nigrodha had been one of the three brothers who gave honey to a Pacceka Buddha in a past life (for the story see Asoka and Mhv.v.49ff). Nigrodha had called the Pacceka Buddha a cand\u00e1la, hence he was born in a cand\u00e1la village. Asoka invited Nigrodha to the palace and entertained him, and Nigrodha preached to him the Appam\u00e1da Vagga.

Several N\u00e1ga dwellings are mentioned in the books: e.g., Ma\u00f1jerika-bhavana under Sineru, Daddara-bhavana at the foot of Mount Daddara in the Him\u00e1laya, the Dhatarattha-n\u00e1g\u00e1 under the river Yamun\u00e1, the N\u00e1bh\u00e1s\u00e1 N\u00e1g\u00e1 in Lake Nabhasa, and also the N\u00e1gas of Ves\u00e1li, Tacchaka, and Pay\u00e1ga (D.ii.258). The Vinaya (ii.109) contains a list of four royal families of N\u00e1gas (Ahir\u00e1jakul\u00e1ni): Vir\u00fapakkh\u00e1, Er\u00e1path\u00e1, Chaby\u00e1putt\u00e1 and Kanhagotamak\u00e1. Two other N\u00e1ga tribes are generally mentioned together: the Kambalas and the Assataras. It is said (SA.iii.120) that all N\u00e1gas have their young in the Him\u00e1laya.</p><p>Stories are given - e.g., in the Bh\u00faridatta J\u00e1taka - of N\u00e1gas, both male and female, mating with humans; but the offspring of such unions are watery and delicate (J.vi.160). The N\u00e1gas are easily angered and passionate, their breath is poisonous, and their glance can be deadly (J.vi.160, 164). They are carnivorous (J.iii.361), their diet consisting chiefly of frogs (J.vi.169), and they sleep, when in the world of men, on ant hills (ibid., 170). The enmity between the N\u00e1gas and the Garulas is proverbial (D.ii.258). At first the Garulas did not know how to seize the N\u00e1gas, because the latter swallowed large stones so as to be of great weight, but they learnt how in the Pandara J\u00e1taka (q.v.). The N\u00e1gas dance when music is played, but it is said (J.vi.191) that they never dance if any Garula is near (through fear) or in the presence of human dancers (through shame).</p><p>The best known of all N\u00e1gas is Mah\u00e1k\u00e1la, king of Ma\u00f1jerika-bhavana (q.v.). He lives for a whole kappa, and is a very", "pious follower of the Buddha. The N\u00e1gas of his world had the custodianship of a part of the Buddha's relics till they were needed for the M\u00e1ha Th\u00fapa (Mhv.xxxi.27f.), and when the Bodhi tree was being brought to Ceylon they did it great honour during the voyage (Mbv. p.. 163f.). Other N\u00e1ga kings are also mentioned as ruling with great power and majesty and being converted to the Buddha's faith - e.g., Arav\u00e1la, Apal\u00e1l\u00e1, Erapatta, Nandopananda, and Pannaka. (See also Ahicchatta and Ahin\u00e1ga.) In the At\u00e1n\u00e1tiya Sutta (D.iii.198f.), speaking of dwellers of the C\u00e1tummah\u00e1rajika world, the N\u00e1gas are mentioned as occupying the Western Quarter, with Vir\u00fapokkha as their king.</p><p>The N\u00e1gas had two chief settlements in Ceylon, in N\u00e1gad\u00edpa (q.v.) and at the mouth of the river Kaly\u00e1n\u00ed. It was to settle a dispute between two N\u00e1ga chiefs of N\u00e1gad\u00edpa, Mahodara and C\u00falodara, that the Buddha paid his second visit to Ceylon. During that visit he made a promise to another N\u00e1ga-king, Manjakkhika of Kaly\u00e1n\u00ed, to pay him a visit, and the Buddha's third visit was in fulfilment of that undertaking (Mhv.i.48f.).</p><p>The N\u00e1gas form one of the guards set up by Sakka in Sineru against the Asuras (J.i.204). The N\u00e1gas were sometimes worshipped by human beings and were offered sacrifices of milk, rice, fish, meat and strong drink (J.i.497f.). The jewel of the N\u00e1gas is famous for its beauty and its power of conferring wishes to its possessor (J.vi.179, 180).</p><p>The word N\u00e1ga is often used as an epithet of the Buddha and the Arahants, and in this connection the etymology given is \u00e1gum na karot\u00ed ti N\u00e1go (e.g., MNid.201). The Bodhisatta was born several times as king of the N\u00e1gas: Atula, Campeyya, Bh\u00faridatta, Mah\u00e1daddara, and Sankhap\u00e1la.</p><p>In the accounts given of the N\u00e1gas, there is undoubtedly great confusion between the N\u00e1gas as supernatural beings,", "as snakes, and as the name of certain non Aryan tribes, but the confusion is too difficult to unravel.</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>N\u00e1ga</h2>  </li></ul><hr><h4>1.

Equally generous were his descendants - Canda, Suriya, M\u00e1tali and Pa\u00f1casikha. But the next in descent, Pa\u00f1casikha's son, Maccharikosiya, became a miser. He stopped all giving and lived in abject poverty.

Sakka saw this, and, accompanied by Canda and the others, appeared before him disguised as a brahmin. Advancing towards him, Sakka asked him the way to Benares, and, pretending to be deaf, approached the place where the porridge was being cooked and asked for some. Maccharikosiya refused to give him any, but Sakka insisted on reciting to him some stanzas on the value of giving, and then Kosiya agreed to give him a little porridge. One by one the others, also disguised as brahmins, approached, and, in spite of all his efforts, Kosiya was forced to invite them to share his meal. He asked them to fetch small leaves, but in their hands small leaves became large. After the porridge had been served, Pa\u00f1casikha assumed the form of a dog, then of a horse of changing colours, and started chasing Kosiya, while the others stood motionless in the air. Kosiya asked how beings could gain such powers, and Sakka explained to him and revealed their identity. Maccharikosiya went back to Benares and gave away his wealth in charity.

One day, when the Buddha was going his alms round in Tudig\u00e1ma near S\u00e1vatthi, he arrived at Subha's house. The dog saw the Buddha and barked, and the Buddha addressed it as \"Todeyya.\" The dog thereupon ran into the house and lay on a bed, from which no one could drive it away. When Subha asked the cause of the uproar, he was told the story. Thereupon he was very angry, saying that his father had been born in the Brahmaloka, and, in order to refute the Buddha, he visited the monastery. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Subha Sutta. Soon after the Buddha\u2019s death, when Ananda, was staying in S\u00e1vatthi, Subha sent a young man to", "Ananda, with his respects and an invitation to his house. Ananda, having taken medicine, did not go that day. But he went the next day, accompanied by a monk of Cetiya (Cetaka). Their conversation is recorded in the Subha Sutta (2) (D.i.204f).

One day, while Subha was on the throne, he reprimanded the king, disguised as a guard, for smiling disrespectfully, and had him led away and executed before the truth was discovered. Subha then became king and ruled for six years (120-6 A.C.). He built the Subhar\u00e1ja-parivena, the Vall\u00ed-vih\u00e1ra, the Ekadv\u00e1ra vih\u00e1ra and the Nand\u00edg\u00e1maka-vih\u00e1ra.

The Buddha explained to him that the important thing was not birth, but the leading of a good life. The brahmin was pleased and offered him the oblation, but the Buddha refused it, saying that he did not accept presents for chanting verses.

(According to ThagA.i.429, his father was a rich setthi; no mention is made there of his mother).  </p><p>A little while before the birth of the child K\u00e1l\u00ed went to her parents' house in R\u00e1jagaha, and one day, as she was cooling herself, she heard a conversation between two Yakkhas, <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satagira')\">S\u00e1t\u00e1gira</a> and <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata')\">Hemavata</a>. As she listened to their talk, her mind was filled with thoughts of the virtues of the Buddha, and she became a sot\u00e1panna. That same night the child was born and was called Sona.

At that time <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')\">Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na</a> lived near by and often visited her home.

K\u00e1l\u00ed gave him a large carpet to spread in the Buddha's <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')\">Gandhakuti</a>.</p><p>When Sona arrived at the Gandhakuti, he worshipped the Buddha, who asked <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')\">Ananda</a> to find him a lodging. Ananda, reading the Buddha's thoughts, spread a rug in the Buddha's chamber. Late at night Sona went to bed, and, very early the next morning, the Buddha woke him and asked him to recite the Dhamma. Sona recited the whole of the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthaka_s_v')\">Atthakavagga</a>, which he had learnt from Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na. At the end of the recital the Buddha applauded him and gave him a boon. Sona asked for the \"Vinaya-dharapa\u00f1camaganena upasampad\u00e1, which Kacc\u00e1na had asked him to choose. (This means permission to admit a monk into the Order with a chapter of only five monks, one of whom was versed in the Vinaya. For details of Sona's visit to the Buddha, see Vin.i.194ff.; cf. Ud.v.6). Later he returned to Kuraraghara and visited his mother's house. She had heard of the Buddha's applause from the devas, and wished Sona to recite the Dhamma just as he had done before the Buddha, and this he did.</p><p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Sona had resolved to win this eminence. In the time of Vipass\u00ed Buddha he was a member of the Order and sewed a robe for a monk. Later he was a tailor of Benares and mended a Pacceka Buddha's robe (Thag.vss.365-9; AA.i.133f.; ThagA.i.429).</p><p>The Dhammapada Commentary says (DhA.iv.103f) that, on the day when Sona recited the Dhamma in Kuraraghara, K\u00e1l\u00ed went to listen to him, leaving only one female slave in the house. Her house had seven walls and fortified gates and savage dogs on leash. Molten lead flowed round the walls at night, and in the night it proved a slippery surface, difficult to walk on. Nine", "hundred thieves had been awaiting a chance of breaking into the house, and this day they saw their opportunity. They stationed one of their number to watch K\u00e1l\u00ed going to the monastery, and to kill her if she started homewards after the thieves entered her house. When they came her female servant ran to the monastery to tell her about it. But she would not be disturbed and sent her back. Again the servant went, and again she was sent back. When the thief, stationed near K\u00e1l\u00ed, saw her extraordinary piety, he was filled with remorse, and, at the end of the sermon, begged her forgiveness. All the nine hundred thieves joined the Order under Sona Kutikanna, and on the day they became arahants the Buddha appeared before them in a ray of light to encourage them.</p><p>According to the Ud\u00e1na Commentary (UdA.307), Sona was called Kutikanna because he wore ear ornaments worth one crore (koti). It is said that he once went with a caravan to <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii')\">Ujjeni</a>, and when the caravan stopped for the night he slept away from the rest of its members. The caravan started very early and nobody waked Sona. When he finally awoke, he ran along the road till he came to a large tree. There he saw an ugly man tearing off his own flesh and eating it. On enquiry, Sona learnt that he had been a wicked merchant of Bh\u00e1rukaccha, who had been born as a peta because he had deceived his patrons. This revelation filled Sona with great misgivings, which were increased by the sight of two peta boys with blood pouring out of their lips. They had been youths, also of Bh\u00e1rukaccha, who had found fault with their mother for feeding an arahant monk. When Sona returned from Ujjeni he consulted Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na about these things, and resolved to enter the Order.</p><p>The Vinaya says (Vin.i.195f) that when Kacc\u00e1na wished to confer the higher ordination on Sona, it was three years before he could get", "together the necessary chapter of ten monks. This was because there were but few monks in <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avanti')\">Avanti</a> and in the Southern Country; hence Sona's request to the Buddha that he should allow five monks to officiate in Avanti. Other boons asked for by Sona and allowed by the Buddha were:  </p><ul>  <li>(1) Permission to use, in Avanti, shoes with thick linings, because the soil of Avanti was black and always muddy;   </li>  <li>(2) permission to bath constantly; </li>  <li>(3) to use skins for coverlets; </li>  <li>(4) to accept robes set apart for absent monks even   after the lapse of ten days.</li></ul><p>Sona is evidently identical with P\u00e1tih\u00edrasa\u00f1\u00f1aka of the Apad\u00e1na (Ap.ii.392).

He was born in <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaa')\">Camp\u00e1</a>, his father being Usabhasetthi. From the time of his conception his father's wealth continued to increase, and, on the day of his birth, the whole town kept festival. Because in a previous birth he had given a ring, worth one hundred thousand, to a Pacceka Buddha, his body was like burnished gold - hence his name. (He was evidently called Kolivisa because he was a Koliyan, Ap.i.95, 21). His hands and feet were soft like bandhuj\u00edvaka-flowers, and a fine down grew on them (four inches long on his feet, Ap.i.298) curved \"like ear ornaments.\" He lived in great luxury in three palaces, each having its own season.</p><p>King <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')\">Bimbis\u00e1ra</a>, hearing of him, sent for him and Sona went with eighty thousand fellow townsmen. </p>", "<p>In R\u00e1jagaha he heard the Buddha preach, and, winning faith, entered the Order with his parents' consent. The Buddha gave him a subject for meditation, and he went to S\u00edtavana, but many people visited him and he was unable to concentrate. He strove hard, and, through pacing up and down in meditation, painful sores developed on his feet. But he won no attainment and was filled with despair. The Buddha saw this and visited him, and by preaching to him the V\u00edn\u00fapamov\u00e1da Sutta (see Sona Sutta), taught him how to temper energy with calm. Thus corrected, he put forth fresh effort and attained arahantship (Thag.vss.632).</p><p>The Vinaya (i.179ff) gives details of Sona's visit to Bimbis\u00e1ra. The king, being curious to see Sona's feet, sent for him. He and his eighty-thousand companions went to see the Buddha, and there they were greatly impressed by the iddhi-power of S\u00e1gata. Sona then sought the Buddha alone and joined the Order. After ordination he walked about meditating, his feet bled, and his cankamana was covered with blood \"like a slaughter house for oxen.\" After Sona attained arahantship, the Buddha gave him permission to wear shoes with one lining. Sona said he had abandoned eighty cartloads of gold and a retinue of seven elephants. He did not wish, as a monk, to have any luxuries which his colleagues did not share, The Buddha then gave permission to all monks to wear shoes with one lining.</p><p>In the time of Anomadass\u00ed Buddha he was a very rich setthi, and, having gone with others to the vih\u00e1ra and heard the Buddha preach, he decorated a cankamana for the Buddha and a long hall (d\u00edghas\u00e1l\u00e1) for the monks. On the cankamana he scattered various flowers, and, above it, he hung canopies. In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a setthi of Hamsavat\u00ed named Sirivaddha. It was then that he resolved to win eminence as foremost of those", "who strove energetically (aggam \u00e1raddhaviriy\u00e1nan), and in this he was successful (A.i.24). After the death of Kassapa Buddha Sona was a householder in Benares, and built a hut by the river for a Pacceka Buddha, whom he looked after during the rainy season. He was king of the gods for twenty five kappas, and seventy-seven times king among men under the name of Yasodhara. ThagA.i.544f.; cf. Ap.i.93f., where he is called Koliyavessa. The ApA. confused his story with that of Kutikanna; see also AA.i.130f., where the details are different, especially regarding the honour paid by Sona to the Pacceka Buddha. Once, on visiting the Pacceka Buddha's cell, he noticed that the ground outside it was muddy; so he spread on the ground a rug worth one hundred thousand, so that the Pacceka Buddha's feet might not be soiled.</p><p>The Apad\u00e1na mentions (Ap.i.298) a Thera, called Sona Kotiv\u00edsa, evidently identical with the above, the reason given for the name being that he gave away wealth equal in value to twenty crores (v\u00edsa koti). His eminence is ascribed to the fact that, in the time of Vipass\u00ed Buddha, he made a lena (cave) for the Buddha and his monks and spread it with rugs. Buddhaghosa (AA.i.130) gives a variant of his name, calling him Kotivessa, and explains this by saying that he belonged to a vessa (merchant) family worth a crore.</p><p>The Sona Sutta (Cf. AA.ii.680, where he is described as gandhabbasippe cheko) mentions that Sona was a clever player of the v\u00edn\u00e1 before he joined the Order. It was the example of Sona Kolivisa which urged Nandaka and his brother, Bharata, to leave the world. ThagA.i.299.</p><hr><p><b>6.

He had a brother Nanda. When the boys grew up their parents wanted them to marry, but they refused, and declared their desire to become ascetics after the death of their parents. Then the parents suggested that they should all, at once, become ascetics; this they did, and lived in a pleasant grove in the Him\u00e1laya. After some time, because Nanda brought unripe fruit for his parents in spite of Sona's warning, Sona dismissed him. Nanda thereupon sought Manoja, and, with his magic power, helped him to win various kingdoms in Jambud\u00edpa, bringing into subjection one hundred and one kings in seven years, seven months and seven days. All these kings Manoja brought to Brahmavaddhana, where he caroused with them. Nanda spent his time in the Suvannaguh\u00e1 in the Him\u00e1laya, obtaining his alms from Uttarakuru. At the end of the seventh day Manoja looked for Nanda, who, reading his thoughts, appeared before him. Manoja wished to give some token of his gratitude, and Nanda asked that he should intercede for him with Sona and win for him Sona's forgiveness. Together they went to Sona accompanied by a large retinue. Sona explained why he had forbidden Nanda, to look after their parents, and Nanda asked his forgiveness for having given his parents unripe fruit in his eagerness to wait on them. Sona forgave him, and they all lived together once more, while the kings returned to their countries, where they ruled wisely.</p><p>The occasion for the story is the same as that for the S\u00e1ma J\u00e1taka (q.v.), regarding a monk who supported his mother.

Subhadda asked the Buddha if there were any truth in the teachings of other religious instructors. The Buddha said he had no time to discuss that, but that any system devoid of the Noble Eightfold Path was useless for salvation, and he taught Subhadda the Doctrine. Subhadda asked to be allowed to join the Order, and the Buddha gave Amanda special permission to admit him at once without waiting for the usual probationary period.

One day K\u00e1lakann\u00ed, daughter of Vir\u00fapakka and Sir\u00ed, Dhatarattha\u2019s daughter, went to bathe in Anotatta, and a quarrel arose as to which should bathe first. As neither the Four Regent Gods nor Sakka were willing to decide, they referred the two goddesses to Sucipariv\u00e1ra. K\u00e1lakann\u00ed first appeared before him in blue raiment and jewels, and, on being asked what were her qualities, she told him, and was asked to vanish from his sight. Then came Sir\u00ed, diffusing yellow radiance, and the Bodhisatta, discovering her identity and her virtues, welcomed her and offered her his unused couch. Thus was the dispute settled. The bed used by Sir\u00ed came to be called Sirisaya, hence the origin of Sirisayana.</p><p>Sir\u00ed is identified with Uppalavann\u00e1.

The Buddha accepted the invitation, and when, on the next day, he arrived with his monks, he asked for Suppiy\u00e1. On hearing that she was ill, he desired that she be brought to see him.

The principal royal smith had a beautiful daughter, and the Bodhisatta, wishing to win her, made a delicate needle that could pierce, dice and float on water, and for this needle he made seven sheaths. He then went to the village of the head smith, stood outside his house, and sang the praises of his needle. The smith's daughter, who was fanning her father, spoke to the Bodhisatta and asked him to go elsewhere, as no one in that village would want needles. The Bodhisatta answered that his were no ordinary needles, and the head smith asked him to show them. The Bodhisatta suggested that all the smiths be summoned, and in their presence he gave the needle-tube to the head smith. He thought that it was the needle itself, for he could find no end or tip. The tube was handed back to the Bodhisatta, who took out the first sheath. In this way the seven sheaths were removed, and when the needle was at last revealed he made the needle pierce the anvil and lie on the surface of a vessel of water. The whole assembly was filled with envy and admiration, and the head smith gave his daughter to the Bodhisatta.</p><p>The story was related in the same circumstances as the Mah\u00e1ummagga J\u00e1taka (q.t).

She was seven years old when the Buddha paid his first visit to S\u00e1vatthi, and she was present at the dedication of Jetavana with her five hundred companions, carrying vases, flowers, etc., as offering to the Buddha. After the Buddha's sermon she became a sot\u00e1panna.</p><p>It is said that, in the time of Vipass\u00ed Buddha, she belonged to a setthi family, her father being dead.

She filled a golden bowl with richly flavoured milk rice, covering it with another bowl. She then wrapped both vessels all round with jasmine flowers and left the house with her slaves. On the way to the sen\u00e1pati's house she was stopped by his men, but she coaxed them to let her pass, and, as the Buddha approached, saying that she wished to offer him a jasmine garland, she put the two vessels into his alms bowl. She then made the resolve that in every subsequent birth she should be named Suman\u00e1 and that her body should be like a garland of jasmine. When the Buddha arrived in the sen\u00e1pati's house and was served first with soup, he covered his bowl saying that he had already been given his food. At the end of the meal the sen\u00e1pati made enquiries, and, full of admiration for Suman\u00e1's courage, invited her to his house and made her his chief consort. Ever after that she was known as Suman\u00e1, and, wherever she was born, a shower of jasmine flowers fell knee deep on the day of her birth.</p><p>According to the Ther\u00edg\u00e1th\u00e1 Commentary (ThigA.22f), Suman\u00e1 joined the Order in her old age. She was present when the Buddha preached to Pasenadi, the discourse (S.i.68-70) beginning with, \"There are four young creatures, Sire, who may not be disregarded,\" and Pasenadi was established in the Refuges and the Precepts. Suman\u00e1 wished to leave the world, but put off doing so that she might look after her grandmother as long as she lived.</p><p>After the grandmother's death, Suman\u00e1 went with Pasenadi to the vih\u00e1ra, taking such things as rugs and carpets, which she presented to the Order.

During his reign the Pandu king invaded Ceylon, and Sena had to retire into the Malaya district. After the army of the Pandu king had plundered a great part of the kingdom, Sena made a treaty with him and re-gained his throne. He adopted the three sons and the three daughters of Kittaggabodhi: Kassapa, Sena and Udaya, and Sangh\u00e1, Tiss\u00e1 and Kitti. Among the king's good acts was the construction of a monastery on Aritthapabbata for the Pamsukulikas, and a many storeyed p\u00e1s\u00e1da in Jetavana.

The Buddha reminded him that he had not promised to do any of these things, and that, at one time, Sunakkhatta had been loud in his praise of the Buddha and the Dhamma. The Buddha warned him that people would say he had left the Order because its discipline had proved too hard for him.

The Commentaries mention that in the Buddha's day, also, princes and other eminent men received their training at Takkasil\u00e1. Pasenadi, king of Kosala, Mah\u00e1li, chief of the Licchavis, and Bandhula, prince of the Mallas, were classmates in the university of Takkasil\u00e1 (DhA.i.337).

Takkasil\u00e1 was, however, a great centre of trade; people flocked to it from various parts of the country (MNid.i.154), not only from Benares, but also from S\u00e1vatthi, from which city the road lay through Soreyya (DhA.i.326). In ancient times students came to the university from L\u00e1la (J.i.447), from the Kuru country (DhA.iv.88), from Magadha (J.v.161), and from the Sivi country (J.v.210).</p><p> </p><p>The students in the university studied the three Vedas and the eighteen sciences (vijj\u00e1) (J.i.159), which evidently included the science of archery (J.i.356; DhA.iv.66; also medicine and surgery, Vin.i.269f), the art of swordmanship (J.v.128), and elephant-craft (hatthi-sutta) (J.ii.47).

The paying students were entitled to various privileges, and lived with the teacher as members of his family, enjoying his constant company. The students seem mostly to have done their own domestic work, leading a co-operate life, gathering their own firewood and cooking their meals, though mention is made of servants, both male and female, helping in the various tasks (J.i.319).</p><p> </p><p>Only br\u00e1hmanas and khattiyas appear to have been eligible for admission to Takkasil\u00e1 (J.iv.391).</p><p>Discipline was evidently very rigorous, a breach of the rules being severely punished, irrespective of the status of the pupil, who was sometimes flogged on the back with a bamboo stick (J.ii.277f). Often the most promising students were given the daughters of the teachers in marriage as a mark of very special favour. (E.g., DhA.iv.66. Elsewhere (J.vi.347) it is stated that the teacher's daughter was given to the eldest pupil). </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes the teacher and his pupils were invited to a meal at the house of a chief man of the city (J.iv.391).

When the matter was reported to the Buddha he said that such was the nature of arahants. They felt no resentment. At the end of the discourse, Tissa became an arahant (DhA.ii.182ff).</p><hr><p><b>17.

He once asked Asoka why monks were not joyful and gay and Asoka, in order to teach him the reason, gave him the throne for a week, saying that at the end of the week he would be put to death.

He sent the queen a letter through an attendant to an arahant who was in the habit of visiting the palace. This letter fell into the hands of the king who suspected the arahant himself, owing to a similarity", "in his writing to that of the intriguer. The king ordered the arahant to be killed and cast into the sea. The devas, being offended, caused the sea to overflow the land. The total destruction of the country was only averted by the king sending his daughter Dev\u00ed (afterwards Vih\u00e1ramahadev\u00ed), to sea in a golden boat.

It was probably the mother of this Tissa who, we are told (Vsm., p.63), used a cloth worth one hundred to wipe away the impurities of her son's birth, which cloth she afterwards threw out on to the T\u00e1laveli road hoping that it might prove useful to a p\u00e1msuk\u00falika monk.</p><hr><p><b>26.
