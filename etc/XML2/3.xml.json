At that time there dwelt in it a monk who had been ordained late in life (a buddhapabbajita, identified by Buddhaghosa (DA.ii.599) with the buddhapabbajita Subhadda) and had formerly been a barber. He had two sons, handsome, elegant and well versed in the barber's art. When the monk heard of the Buddha's coming, he sent his sons from house to house to collect salt and oil and rice and meal.

The Bodhisatta, noticing some peculiarity in the growth of the lotus, swam to it and recovered the girl, whom he brought up as his daughter, giving her the name of \u00c1sank\u00e1.

The King of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')\">Benares</a>, having heard of her great beauty, came to the forest with a large following and asked for her hand. The Bodhisatta agreed, on condition that the king would tell him her name. The king spent a whole year trying to guess it and, having failed, was returning home in despair, when the girl, looking out of her window, told him of the creeper \u00c1s\u00e1vat\u00ed, for whose fruits gods wait for one thousand years. She thus encouraged him to try again. Another year passed and she again raised hopes in the disappointed king by relating to him the story of a crane whose hopes Sakka had fulfilled. At the end of the third year the king, disgusted by his failure, started to go home, but again the girl engaged him in conversation, and in the course of their talk the girl's name was mentioned. When the king was told that the word had occurred in his talk, he returned to the Bodhisatta and told it to him. The Bodhisatta then gave \u00c1sank\u00e1 in marriage to the king (J.iii.248-54).

Their span of life is two kappas and there is no guarantee that a person who has been born there may not later be reborn in an unhappy condition (A.ii.127; but see Abhs. v.6, where their life-span is given as eight kappas). From time to time these devas utter shouts of joy saying \"aho sukham, aho sukham.\" This sound is the best of sounds. These devas are completely enveloped in ease (sukhena abhisa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1 parisa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1) (A.iii.202; D. iii.219).

Then some being or other, either because he has finished his life there or because his merit is exhausted, leaves the \u00c1bhassara world and is reborn in the Brahmavim\u00e1na. Others follow his example, and it is then that the first to be reborn in the Brahma-world thinks of himself as Brahm\u00e1, the eternal, etc. (D.iii.29).</p><p> </p><p>When inhabitants of the \u00c1bhassara-world are reborn as humans, their existence continues to be like that which they had in the brahma-world itself. As time goes on, however, they lose their qualities and develop the characteristics, both physical and mental, of human beings (For details see D.iii.84ff., PsA.253).

When her condition was discovered her colleagues consulted <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')\">Devadatta</a>, who declared that she was no true nun.

(For details see J.i.148; Up\u00e1li's handling of the case won the Buddha's special commendation, see, e.g., AA.i.172). When the boy was born the king reared him, and the boy was ordained at the age of seven. The boy came to be called Kum\u00e1ra, because he joined the Order so young and was of royal upbringing, and also because the Buddha, when sending him little delicacies such as fruit, referred to him as Kum\u00e1ra Kassapa. Once when Kum\u00e1ra Kassapa was meditating in <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhavana')\">Andhavana</a>, an an\u00e1g\u00e1m\u00ed Brahm\u00e1, who had been his companion in the time of Kassapa Buddha, appeared before him, and asked him fifteen questions which only the Buddha could answer. This led to the preaching of the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/va/vammiika_sutta')\">Vammika Sutta</a> (M.i.143ff), and after dwelling on its teachings Kassapa", "became an arahant. (For Kum\u00e1ra Kassapa's story see J.i.147ff; AA.i.158f; ThagA.i.322f; MA.i.335f). His mother, too, developed insight and attained to arahantship. It is said that she wept for twelve years because she could not be with Kassapa, and one day, seeing him in the street, as she ran towards him and fell, milk flowed from her breasts and wet her robe. Kassapa, realising that her great love was standing in the way of her attainments, spoke harshly to her that she might love him the less. The ruse succeeded and she became an arahant that very day (DhA.iii.147).</p><p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Kassapa was a learned brahmin, and having heard a monk ranked foremost in eloquence, he wished for a similar distinction and did many acts of piety towards that end. When the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were being forgotten, he, together with six others, entered the Order and lived a life of rigorous asceticism on the summit of a mountain. (Ap.ii.473f; the details of this story are given in DhA.ii.210-12; among Kassapa's companions were also Pukkus\u00e1ti, D\u00e1ruc\u00edriya, Dabba Mallaputta and Sabhiya; see also UdA.80f).</p><p>Two verses of deep significance ascribed to Kum\u00e1ra-Kassapa are found in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 (vv.201.202). Although it is said that he was a very eloquent speaker, the examples given of his preaching are extremely scanty. The Anguttara Commentary (i.159) states that the Buddha gave him his title from the skilful way in which he argued with P\u00e1y\u00e1si, as related in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pa/payasi')\">P\u00e1y\u00e1si Sutta</a>; but this cannot be correct for, according to<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala')\">Dhammap\u00e1la</a> (VvA.297), the events of the P\u00e1y\u00e1si Sutta took place after the Buddha's death.

Once the two Chief Disciples, desiring quiet, spent the rainy season with him, he promising to tell nobody of their presence. After the rains, as the Elders were about to return, Kok\u00e1lika informed the inhabitants of their stay and blamed them for not showing them hospitality. The townspeople hurried to the Elders with various offerings; these were, however, refused, and Kok\u00e1lika, who had expected that the gifts would be given to him, was disappointed. The Elders promised the townsmen to visit them again, and on their return were accompanied by a large following of monks to whom the townsmen showed all honour. The gifts were divided among the monks, Kok\u00e1lika not receiving a share. He thereupon became abusive, and the Chief Disciples left the place. The people were annoyed, and insisted that Kok\u00e1lika should either bring them back or depart himself. The Elders refused to return, and Kok\u00e1lika, in great anger, sought the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')\">Buddha</a> at <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')\">S\u00e1vatthi</a>, and in spite of his injunctions spoke ill of the Chief Disciples. Having three times accused the Elders of sinful desires, he left <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')\">Jetavana</a>, but boils immediately came out on his body, swelling and bursting. Groaning with pain, he fell down at the gate of Jetavana.

He lived in the household for three thousand years, in three palaces, Tusita, Santusita and Santuttha; his chief wife was Rucigatt\u00e1 and their son was Satthav\u00e1ha. Kon\u00e1gamana left the world on an elephant and practised austerities only for six months, at the end of which time he was given milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Aggisoma and grass for his seat by the yavap\u00e1laka Tinduka. His Bodhi was an Udumbara tree. His first sermon was preached in the Migad\u00e1ya near Sudassana-nagara, at the foot of a Mah\u00e1-s\u00e1la tree. He held only one assembly of his disciples, who numbered thirty thousand. His body was thirty cubits in height. He died in the Pabbat\u00e1r\u00e1ma at the age of thirty thousand. His relics were scattered. His chief disciples were Bh\u00edyya and Uttara among monks, and Samudd\u00e1 and Uttar\u00e1 among nuns, his constant attendant being Sotthiya. His chief patrons were Ugga and Somadeva among laymen, and S\u00edval\u00e1 and S\u00e1m\u00e1 among laywomen. The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Pabbata of Mithil\u00e1.

The Buddha also preached at the Ratanam\u00e1la, the Sudassanam\u00e1la and the N\u00e1gam\u00e1laka and gave his girdle for the people's worship.

Pasenadi, king of Kosala, hearing of Kundadh\u00e1na, was interested, and being satisfied by personal investigation that the Elder was blameless, provided him with all necessaries, so that he need no longer go round for alms.

Seeing two monks, firm friends, on their way to the uposatha held by the Buddha, he had a mischievous desire to test their friendship, and when one of the monks retired into the forest leaving the other on the road, he followed the former, unseen by him, assuming the form of a woman arranging her hair, adjusting her garments, and so on. The second monk, seeing his friend return and shocked by his apparent misdemeanour, left him in disgust, refusing to perform the uposatha with him. Realising the effect of his practical joke, the sprite did all he could to make amends, but the friendship of the two monks was for ever spoilt. The sprite suffered the fears of hell for a whole Buddha-era, and even in his last birth as Kundadh\u00e1na his evil kamma pursued him, as seen above.

He was converted with Bhaddiya and four other S\u00e1kyan nobles at Anupiy\u00e1, shortly after the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu (Vin.ii.182; DhA.i.112f). The Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 Commentary says (ThagA.i.235f; Thag.118, 155f, According to DhA.i.117, Kimbila became an arahant soon after ordination together with Bhagu; see also J.i.140 and AA.i.108) that while at Anupiy\u00e1 the Buddha, in order to arouse Kimbila, conjured up a beautiful woman in her prime and then showed her to him passing into old age. Greatly agitated, Kimbila sought the Buddha, heard the Doctrine and, having entered the Order, in due course won arahantship. Kimbila seems to have maintained throughout his early friendship with Anuruddha, dwelling with him and Nandiya, now in this wood or park, now in that. The Buddha visited them at P\u00e1c\u00edna-vamsad\u00e1ya when he was going away, disgusted with the recalcitrant monks of Kosamb\u00ed. (Vin.i.350; J.iii.489; see also Upakkilesa Sutta, M.iii.155ff and ThagA.i.275f).

Their number was increased by the presence of Bhagu, Kundadh\u00e1na, Revata and Ananda, on the occasion when the Buddha preached the Nalakap\u00e1na Sutta in the Pal\u00e1savana at Nalakap\u00e1na (M.i.462ff).</p><p> </p><p>In three different places in the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya (A.iii.247; 339; iv.84) record is made of a conversation between Kimbila and the Buddha, when Kimbila asks how the Dhamma could be made to endure long after the Buddha's death and what were the causes which might bring about its early disappearance. The conversation took place in the Veluvana (Niceluvana?) in Kimbil\u00e1. According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.642),", "however, it would appear that the Kimbila mentioned here was not Kimbila the S\u00e1kyan but another. We are told that this Kimbila was a setthiputta of Kimbil\u00e1. He joined the Order and acquired the power of knowing his previous births. He recollected how he had been a monk at the time when Kassapa Buddha's religion was falling into decay, and seeing how the Faith was neglected by its followers, he made a stairway up a cliff and lived there as a recluse. It was this memory of his previous life which prompted Kimbila's question.</p><p>Elsewhere (S.v.322f ) the Buddha is reported as questioning Kimbila at the same spot on the question of breathing. Kimbila remains silent though the question is put three times. Ananda intervenes and suggests that the Buddha should himself furnish the answer so that the monks may learn it and profit thereby.</p><p> </p><p>In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, Kimbila had been a householder; after the Buddha's death he erected a pavilion of salala-garlands round his cetiya (ThagA.i.235).

We are told that a king of Benares, named R\u00e1ma (the Mtu.i.353 calls him Kola and explains from this the name of the Koliyas), suffered from leprosy, and being detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and retired into the forest. There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon recovered, and, while wandering about, came across Piy\u00e1, the eldest of the five daughters of Okk\u00e1ka, she herself being afflicted with leprosy. R\u00e1ma, having cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons. With the help of the king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in doing so. The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site was discovered on a tiger-track (vyagghapatha) it was also called Vyagghapajj\u00e1.

The territories of the S\u00e1kiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohin\u00ed. The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed relationship with the Buddha. (It is said that once the Koliyan youths carried away many S\u00e1kiyan maidens while they were bathing, but the S\u00e1kiyans, regarding the Koliyans as relatives, took no action; DA.i.262). A quarrel once arose between the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohin\u00ed, which irrigated", "the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention of the Buddha. In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the membership of the Order, and during the Buddha's stay in the neighbourhood, he lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara.

The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosamb\u00ed, becoming angry at the monks' behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King D\u00edghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosamb\u00ed and, journeying through B\u00e1lakalonak\u00e1rag\u00e1ma and the P\u00e1c\u00ednavamsadaya, retired alone to keep retreat in the P\u00e1rileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosamb\u00ed, and, coming to the Buddha at S\u00e1vatthi, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. (Vin.i.337-57; J.iii.486ff (cp.iii.211ff); DhA.i.44ff; SA.ii.222f; the story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in Ud.iv.5. and in S.iii.94, but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosamb\u00ed uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics. But see UdA.248f, and SA.ii.222f).</p><p>The Commentaries give two reasons for the name Kosamb\u00ed. The more favoured is (E.g., UdA.248; SNA.300; MA.i.535. Epic tradition ascribes the foundation of Kosamb\u00ed to a Cedi prince, while the origin of the Vatsa people is traced to a king of K\u00e1s\u00ed, see PHAI.83, 84) that the city was so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once", "occupied by the sage Kusumba (v.l. Kusumbha). Another explanation is (e.g., MA i.539; PsA.413) that large and stately margossa-trees (Kosammarukkh\u00e1) grew in great numbers in and around the city.</p><p>Bakkula was the son of a banker in Kosamb\u00ed. (MA.ii.929; AA.i.170). In the Buddha's time there lived near the ferry at Kosamb\u00ed a powerful N\u00e1ga-king, the reincarnation of a former ship's captain. The N\u00e1ga was converted by S\u00e1gata, who thereby won great fame. (AA.i.179; but see J.i.360, where the incident is given as happening at Bhaddavatik\u00e1). Ruj\u00e1 was born in a banker's family in Kosamb\u00ed (J.vi.237f). Citta-pandita was also born there (J.iv.392). A king, by name Kosambaka (q.v.), once ruled there.</p><p>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Ves\u00e1li wished to excommunicate Yasa K\u00e1kandakaputta, he went by air to Kosamb\u00ed, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres (Vin.ii.298; Mhv.iv.17).</p><p>It was at Kosamb\u00ed that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks (Vin.ii.307).</p><p>Kosamb\u00ed is mentioned in the Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya (S.iv.179; but see AA.i.170; MA.ii.929; PsA.491, all of which indicate that the city was on the Yamun\u00e1) as being \"Gang\u00e1ya nadiy\u00e1 t\u00edre.\" This is either an error, or here the name Gang\u00e1 refers not to the Ganges but to the Yamun\u00ed.

It is mentioned second in the list of sixteen Mah\u00e1janapadas (E.g., A.i.213; iv.252, etc.). In the Buddha's time it was a powerful kingdom ruled over by Pasenadi, who was succeeded by his son Vid\u00fadabha. By this time K\u00e1s\u00ed was under the subjection of Kosala, for we find that when Bimbis\u00e1ra, king of Magadha, married Kosaladev\u00ed, daughter of Mah\u00e1kosala and sister of Pasenadi, a village in K\u00e1s\u00ed was given as part of the dowry (J.ii.237; iv.342f). Various J\u00e1takas indicate that the struggle between K\u00e1si and Kosala had been very prolonged (See, e.g., J.ii.21f; iii.115f; 211f; v.316, 425). Sometimes the K\u00e1si king would attack Kosala, capture the king and rule over the country. At others the Kosala king would invade K\u00e1si and annex it to his own territory. Several Kosala kings who succeeded in doing this, are mentioned by name - e.g., Dabbasena (J.iii.13), D\u00edgh\u00e1vu (J.iii.211f), Vanka (J.iii.168) and Kamsa; the last being given the special title of \"B\u00e1ran\u00e1sigg\u00e1ha,\" (J.ii.403; v.112) probably in recognition of the fact that he completed the conquest of K\u00e1si. Other kings of Kosala who came in conflict with Benares in one way or another are mentioned - e.g., D\u00edghiti (J.iii.211f; Vin.i.342f), Mallika (J.ii.3), and Chatta (J.iii.116). Sometimes the kings of the two countries entered into matrimonial alliances (e.g., J.iii.407). With the capture of K\u00e1si the power of Kosala increased rapidly, until a struggle between this country and Magadha became inevitable. Bimbis\u00e1ra's marriage was probably a political alliance, but it only served to postpone the evil day. Quite soon after his death there were many fierce fights between Aj\u00e1tasattu, his successor, and Pasenadi, these fights bringing varying fortunes to the combatants. Once", "Aj\u00e1tasattu was captured alive, but Pasenadi spared his life and gave him his daughter, Vajir\u00e1, in marriage and for a time all went well. Later, however, after his conquest of the Licchavis, Aj\u00e1tasattu seems to have succeeded in establishing his sway in Kosala. (See Vincent Smith, op. cit., 32f). In the sixth century B.C. the S\u00e1kyan territory of Kapilavatthu was subject to Kosala. The Sutta Nip\u00e1ta (vs.405) speaks of the Buddha's birthplace as belonging to the Kosalans; see also A.i.276, where Kapilavatthu is mentioned as being in Kosala.

Yet, though woodland tracts were numerous (see, e.g., SA.i.225) where monks could", "meditate in solitude, the number of monks actually found in Kosala was not large (VT.i.226).

Various J\u00e1takas indicate that the struggle between K\u00e1si and Kosala had been very prolonged (See, e.g., J.ii.21f; iii.115f; 211f; v.316, 425). Sometimes the K\u00e1si king would attack Kosala, capture the king and rule over the country. At others the Kosala king would invade K\u00e1si and annex it to his own territory. Several Kosala kings who succeeded in doing this, are mentioned by name - e.g., Dabbasena (J.iii.13), D\u00edgh\u00e1vu (J.iii.211f), Vanka (J.iii.168) and Kamsa; the last being given the special title of \"B\u00e1ran\u00e1sigg\u00e1ha,\" (J.ii.403; v.112) probably in recognition of the fact that he completed the conquest of K\u00e1si. Other kings of Kosala who came in conflict with Benares in one way or another are mentioned - e.g., D\u00edghiti (J.iii.211f; Vin.i.342f), Mallika (J.ii.3), and Chatta (J.iii.116). Sometimes the kings of the two countries entered into matrimonial alliances (e.g., J.iii.407). With the capture of K\u00e1si the power of Kosala increased rapidly, until a struggle between this country and Magadha became inevitable. Bimbis\u00e1ra's marriage was probably a political alliance, but it only served to postpone the evil day. Quite soon after his death there were many fierce fights between Aj\u00e1tasattu, his successor, and Pasenadi, these fights bringing varying fortunes to the combatants. Once", "Aj\u00e1tasattu was captured alive, but Pasenadi spared his life and gave him his daughter, Vajir\u00e1, in marriage and for a time all went well. Later, however, after his conquest of the Licchavis, Aj\u00e1tasattu seems to have succeeded in establishing his sway in Kosala. (See Vincent Smith, op. cit., 32f). In the sixth century B.C. the S\u00e1kyan territory of Kapilavatthu was subject to Kosala. The Sutta Nip\u00e1ta (vs.405) speaks of the Buddha's birthplace as belonging to the Kosalans; see also A.i.276, where Kapilavatthu is mentioned as being in Kosala. Elsewhere (M.ii.124) Pasenadi is reported as saying, \"Bhagav\u00e1 pi Kosalako, aham pi Kosalako.\"</p><p> </p><p>At the time of the Buddha S\u00e1vatthi was the capital of Kosala. Next in importance was Saketa, which, in ancient days, had sometimes been the capital (J.iii.270; Mtu.i.348). There was also Ayojjh\u00e1, on the banks of the Sarayu, which, judging from the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, must once have been the chief city; but in the sixth century B.C. it was quite unimportant.</p><p> </p><p>The river Sarayu divided Kosala into two parts, Uttara Kosala and Dakkhina Kosala (Law: Geog., p.6). </p><p> </p><p>Other Kosala rivers mentioned in the books are the Aciravat\u00ed (D.i.235) and the Sundarik\u00e1 (S.i.167; SN. p.97; but see M.i.39, where the river is called B\u00e1huk\u00e1). </p><p>Among localities spoken of as being in Kosala are:</p><ul>  <li>  <p>Icch\u00e1nangala (A.iii.30, 341; iv.340,   etc.), </li>  <li>  <p>Ukkatth\u00e1 (D.i.87), </li>  <li>  <p>Ekas\u00e1l\u00e1 (S.i.111), </li>  <li>  <p>Opas\u00e1da (M.ii.164), </li>  <li>  <p>Kesaputta of the K\u00e1l\u00e1mas (A.i.188),  </li>  <li>  <p>Candalakappa (M.ii.209), </li>  <li>  <p>Toranavatthu (S.iv.374), </li>", "<li>  <p>Dandakappa (A.iii.402), </li>  <li>  <p>Nagaravinda (M.iii.290), </li>  <li>  <p>Nalakap\u00e1na (A.v.122; M.i.462),   </li>  <li>  <p>N\u00e1land\u00e1 (S.iv.322), </li>  <li>  <p>Pankadh\u00e1 (A.i.236), </li>  <li>  <p>Ven\u00e1gapura (A.i.180), </li>  <li>  <p>Veludv\u00e1ra (S.v.352), </li>  <li>  <p>S\u00e1l\u00e1 (M.i.285, 400; S.v.227),   </li>  <li>  <p>S\u00e1l\u00e1vatika (D.i.244), and </li>  <li>  <p>Setavya (D.ii.316). </li></ul><p>The Mtu. adds Dronavastuka (iii.377) and M\u00e1rakaranda (i.317).</p><p> </p><p>The Commentaries (E.g., SNA.ii.400f; DA.i.239f) give a curious explanation of the name Kosal\u00e1. It is said that when nothing could make Mah\u00e1pan\u00e1da smile, his father offered a big reward for anyone who could succeed in doing this. People, accordingly, left their work and flocked to the court, but it, was not until Sakka sent down a celestial actor that Mah\u00e1pan\u00e1da showed any signs of being amused. When this happened the men returned to their various duties, and on their way home, when meeting their friends, they asked of each other, \"Kacci bho kusalam, kacci bho kusalam.\" The district where this occurred came to be called Kosal\u00e1 on account of the repetition of the word kusala.</p><p> </p><p>The Buddha spent the greater part of his time in Kosala, either in S\u00e1vatthi or in touring in the various parts of the country, and many of the Vinaya rules were formulated in Kosala. (See Vinaya Index, s.v. Kosala). It is said (SA.i.221) that alms were plentiful in Kosala, though, evidently (J.i.329), famines, due to drought, were not unknown. Yet, though woodland tracts were numerous (see, e.g., SA.i.225) where monks could", "meditate in solitude, the number of monks actually found in Kosala was not large (VT.i.226). B\u00e1var\u00ed himself was a native of Kosala (SN.v.976), yet he preferred to have his hermitage in Dakkhin\u00e1patha.</p><p> </p><p>After the Buddha's death, his unnaloma was deposited in a th\u00fapa in Kosala (Bu.xxviii.9). It is said that the measures used in Kosala were larger than those of Magadha - thus one Kosala pattha was equal to four Magadha patthas (SNA.ii.476).</p><p>Kosala is often mentioned in combination with K\u00e1si in the compound K\u00e1si-Kosala; Pasenadi was king of K\u00e1si-Kosala (e.g., A.v.59) (cf. Ariga-Magadha). See also Pasenadi.</p><hr><p><b>Kosala</b>.-A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned in a list of names.

The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Simsap\u00e1vana in Kosamb\u00ed (S.v.437). Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na lived in a woodland near Kosamb\u00ed after the holding of the First Council (PvA.141).</p><p>Already in the Buddha's time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosamb\u00ed - the Kukkut\u00e1r\u00e1ma, the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma, the P\u00e1v\u00e1rika-ambavana (these being given by three of the most eminent citizens of Kosamb\u00ed, named respectively, Kukkuta, Ghosita and P\u00e1v\u00e1rika), and the Badarik\u00e1r\u00e1ma. The Buddha visited Kosamb\u00ed on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books. (Thomas, op. cit., 115, n.2, doubts the authenticity of the stories connected with the Buddha's visits to Kosamb\u00ed, holding that these stories are of later invention).</p><p>The Buddha spent his ninth rainy season at Kosamb\u00ed, and it was on his way there on this occasion that he made a detour to Kamm\u00e1ssadamma and was offered in marriage M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1, daughter of the brahmin M\u00e1gandiya. The circumstances are narrated in connection with the M\u00e1gandiya Sutta. M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 took the Buddha's refusal as an insult to herself, and, after her marriage to King Udena, tried in various ways to take revenge on the Buddha, and also on Udena's wife S\u00e1mavat\u00ed, who had been the Buddha's follower. (DhA.i.199ff; iii.193ff; iv.1ff; Ud.vii.10).</p><p>A great schism once arose among the monks in Kosamb\u00ed. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be", "dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosamb\u00ed, becoming angry at the monks' behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King D\u00edghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosamb\u00ed and, journeying through B\u00e1lakalonak\u00e1rag\u00e1ma and the P\u00e1c\u00ednavamsadaya, retired alone to keep retreat in the P\u00e1rileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosamb\u00ed, and, coming to the Buddha at S\u00e1vatthi, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. (Vin.i.337-57; J.iii.486ff (cp.iii.211ff); DhA.i.44ff; SA.ii.222f; the story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in Ud.iv.5. and in S.iii.94, but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosamb\u00ed uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics. But see UdA.248f, and SA.ii.222f).</p><p>The Commentaries give two reasons for the name Kosamb\u00ed. The more favoured is (E.g., UdA.248; SNA.300; MA.i.535. Epic tradition ascribes the foundation of Kosamb\u00ed to a Cedi prince, while the origin of the Vatsa people is traced to a king of K\u00e1s\u00ed, see PHAI.83, 84) that the city was so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once", "occupied by the sage Kusumba (v.l. Kusumbha). Another explanation is (e.g., MA i.539; PsA.413) that large and stately margossa-trees (Kosammarukkh\u00e1) grew in great numbers in and around the city.</p><p>Bakkula was the son of a banker in Kosamb\u00ed. (MA.ii.929; AA.i.170). In the Buddha's time there lived near the ferry at Kosamb\u00ed a powerful N\u00e1ga-king, the reincarnation of a former ship's captain. The N\u00e1ga was converted by S\u00e1gata, who thereby won great fame. (AA.i.179; but see J.i.360, where the incident is given as happening at Bhaddavatik\u00e1).

One day the Buddha visited Sumana, and Khujjuttar\u00e1, having heard the Buddha preach to him, became a <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')\">sot\u00e1panna</a>. That day she spent the whole amount on flowers. The queen asked her how she had obtained so many, and she told her the whole story. From that time S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed showed Khujjuttar\u00e1 all honour, bathed her in perfumed water, and heard the Dhamma from her. Khujjuttar\u00e1 became, as it were, a mother to S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed, and going regularly to hear the Dhamma, would return and preach it to her and her five hundred attendant women. Under the instruction of Khujjuttar\u00e1 they all became sot\u00e1pannas. When S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed expressed a desire to see the Buddha, Khujjuttar\u00e1 suggested that she should pierce holes in the walls of the palace and gaze on the Buddha as he passed along the street. After the death of S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed, Khujjuttar\u00e1 seems to have spent all her time in religious works, listening to the preaching of the Dhamma. The Buddha declared her foremost among lay women by reason of her extensive knowledge (bahussut\u00e1nam). A.i.26; DhA.i.208ff; AA.i.226, 237f; ItvA.23f.; PsA.498f.</p><p>Once, in the past, she was a serving-woman of the king of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')\">Benares</a>, and one day, having seen a <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacceka_buddha')\">Pacceka Buddha</a> who was slightly hunch-backed, she threw a blanket over her shoulder, and", "bending down to look like a hunchback, she imitated the Buddha's manner of walking. Therefore, in this present birth she herself was hunchbacked. On another occasion eight Pacceka Buddhas, receiving their bowls filled with rice-porridge from the palace, found the bowls so hot that they were obliged to move them from one hand to the other. Seeing this, Khujjuttar\u00e1 gave them eight ivory bracelets as stands for their bowls. It is said that these bracelets are still preserved in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandamulapabbhara')\">Nandam\u00fala-pabbh\u00e1ra</a>. Because of this act Khujjuttar\u00e1 obtained profound wisdom in this birth, and was able to learn the Tipitaka by heart. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was the daughter of a treasurer, and had a friend who was a nun; one day when she was adorning herself at eventide the nun visited her, and as there was no servant-girl at the time Khujjuttar\u00e1 asked the nun to do various things for her. As a result she was born as a slave. Her desire to become chief among learned lay-women was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, on her seeing a similar rank bestowed on a lay-woman (DhA.i.226f, etc.; Dvy.339-41).</p><p>It is said that the discourses in the Itivuttaka are those which Khujjuttar\u00e1 learned from the Buddha and later repeated to S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed and her attendant women. Because these discourses were all preached at Kosamb\u00ed and repeated there by her, there was no need to specify the place of their preaching; hence the formula \"Ekam samayam Bhagav\u00e1 Kosambiyam viharati\" is omitted, and instead is found \"vuttam h'etam Bhagavat\u00e1 arahat\u00e1.\" (ItvA.32).</p><p>Khujjuttar\u00e1 is several times mentioned as the paragon among lay-women disciples (E.g., A.i.88; ii.164; iv.368; S.ii.236), and in the Commentaries (E.g., DA.iii.910) she is given as an example of k\u00e1mabhoginiyo (women who enjoyed the pleasures of", "the senses).

The Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya (S.v.15f; 171f) records several discussions which took place there between Ananda and Bhadda. It may have been a favourite resort of Ananda, for we find the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara going there to enquire as to his whereabouts (A.v.342; M.i.349). It was also (probably at a later date) the residence of N\u00e1rada who converted King Munda (A.iii.57f), and afterwards of Sonaka, the upajjh\u00e1ya of Siggava, and of Candavajji, the teacher Mogaliputta-Tissa (Mhv.v.122). Buddhaghosa mentions (MA.ii.571; AA.ii.866) that the Kukkutar\u00e1ma was made by Kukkuta Setthi, but gives no further particulars. Here there is probably some confusion with the \u00e1r\u00e1ma of the same name at Kosamb\u00ed. Hiouen Thsang (Beal: op. cit.ii, 95) says that the Kukkut\u00e1r\u00e1ma was to the southeast of the old city of P\u00e1taliputta and was built by Asoka when he first became a convert to the Buddha's religion. \"It was a sort of first-fruit and a pattern of majestic construction.\" Only the foundation of the building was left at the time of Hiouen Thsang's visit. It is probable that this account refers to the Asok\u00e1r\u00e1ma which Asoka built as the first of his Buddhist structures, and that the Asok\u00e1r\u00e1ma was constructed on the site of the old Kukkut\u00e1r\u00e1ma.

If the conjecture made above, namely that the Asok\u00e1r\u00e1ma replaced the Kukkut\u00e1r\u00e1ma, be correct, it may have been that the place was known by both names in Asoka's time.</p><p> </p><p>3.

Frequent references to it are found in the P\u00e1li Canon. It is said that Kuru was originally the name of the chieftains (r\u00e1jakum\u00e1r\u00e1) of the country and that their territory was later named after them. Buddhaghosa records a tradition (DA.ii.481f; MA.i.184 etc.) which states that, when Mandh\u00e1t\u00e1 returned to Jambud\u00edpa from his sojourn in the four Mah\u00e1d\u00edpas and in the devalokas, there were in his retinue a large number of the people of Uttarakuru. They settled down in Jambud\u00edpa, and their settlement was known as Kururattha. It had many towns and villages.</p><p>The country seems to have had very little political influence in the Buddha's time, though, in the past, Pa\u00f1c\u00e1la, Kuru and Kekaka were evidently three of the most powerful kingdoms (See, e.g., J.ii.214). According to the J\u00e1takas (E.g., J.v.57, 484; vi.255. Also Mtu.i.34; ii.419), the kingdom of Kuru was three hundred leagues in extent and its capital, Indapatta, seven leagues in circumference. The ruling dynasty at Indapatta belonged to the Yudhitthila-gotta (J.iii.400; iv.361). Among the kings of the past, Dhana\u00f1jaya Koravya is mentioned several times (J.ii.366; iii.400; iv.450; vi.260 etc.) and reference is also made to a king called Koravya (J.iv.361; v.457) whose son was the Bodhisatta Sutasoma. During the Buddha's time, also, the chieftain of Kuru was called Koravya, and his discussion with the Elder Ratthap\u00e1la, who was himself the scion of a noble family of the Kurus, is recounted in the Ratthap\u00e1la Sutta (M.ii.65ff). Perhaps at one time the Kuru kingdom extended as far as Uttarapa\u00f1c\u00e1la, for in the Somanassa J\u00e1taka (J.iv.444), Uttarapa\u00f1c\u00e1la is mentioned as a town in the Kururattha, with Renu as its king.</p><p>Koravya had a park called Mig\u00e1c\u00edra where", "Ratthap\u00e1la took up his residence when he visited his parents (MA.ii.725). The people of Kuru had a reputation for deep wisdom and good health, and this reputation is mentioned (MA.i.184f; AA.ii.820; they were also probably reputed to be virtuous; see the Kurudhamma J\u00e1taka) as the reason for the Buddha having delivered some of his most profound discourses to the Kurus, for example, the Mah\u00e1nid\u00e1na, and the Mah\u00e1satipatth\u00e1na Suttas. Among other discourses delivered in the Kuru country are the M\u00e1gandiya Sutta, the Ana\u00f1jasapp\u00e1ya Sutta, the Sammosa Sutta and the Ariyavas\u00e1 Sutta. All these were preached at Kamm\u00e1ssadhamma, which is described as a nigama of the Kur\u00fas, where the Buddha resided from time to time. Another town of the Kur\u00fas, which we find mentioned, is Thullakotthika, the birthplace of Ratthap\u00e1la, and here the Buddha stayed during a tour (M.ii.54; ThagA.ii.30). Udena's queen, M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1, came from Kuru (DhA.i.199), and Aggidatta, chaplain to the Kosala king, lived on the boundary between Kuru and Ariga and Magadha, honoured by the inhabitants of all three kingdoms (DhA.iii.242).</p><p>The Kuru country is generally identified as the district around Th\u00e1nesar, with its capital Indapatta, near the modern Delhi (CAGI.379f).

This view is further strengthened by the fact that its mixed Sanskrit version in the Mah\u00e1vastu (i.357f) is not placed in any definite group. According to the Mah\u00e1vastu, the Pratyeka Buddhas, five hundred in number, were living in Rsipatana near Benares, and when they heard from the Suddh\u00e1v\u00e1sa devas of the approach of the Buddha in twelve years, they disappeared from Rsipatana, each repeating one of the verses of the sutta.</p><p>The Apad\u00e1na (i.7ff) includes the stanzas of the Khaggavis\u00e1na Sutta in its chapter called the Pacceka-buddh\u00e1pad\u00e1na and prefaces them with several introductory stanzas. A few stanzas are also added at the end by way of conclusion. In its exegesis the Apad\u00e1na Commentary (ApA.i.106f) gives the names of several Pacceka Buddhas.

On one occasion, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks regarding the six", "spheres of sense contact, M\u00e1ra arranged an earthquake to break the monks' concentration, but failed to achieve his object (S.i.112). Several J\u00e1takas were related by the Buddha in the K\u00fat\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1: the Sig\u00e1la (J.ii.5), the Telov\u00e1da (J.ii.262), the B\u00e1hiya (J.i.420), and the Ekapanna (J.i.504). It was here that the Buddha finally agreed to grant the request of the five hundred S\u00e1kyan women, led by Paj\u00e1pat\u00ed Gotam\u00ed, that they might be ordained as nuns. They had followed the Buddha hither from Kapilavatthu (A.iv.274f; Vin.ii.253f; J.ii.392). The Buddha gave Paj\u00e1pat\u00ed Gotam\u00ed, at her special request, a summary of his doctrine (A.iv.280). It was also at the K\u00fat\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1 that the Buddha uttered his prophecy as to the ultimate downfall of-the Licchavis (S.ii.267f).</p><p> </p><p>It was customary for the Buddha, when staying at the K\u00fat\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1, to spend the noonday siesta in the woods outside the Mah\u00e1vana, at the foot of a tree; visitors coming at that time would, if their desire to see him was insistent (see, e.g., D.i.151; A.iii.75), seek him there or be conducted to him. Sometimes he would express his desire to see no one during such a retreat, except the monk who brought him his food.</p><p>On one occasion the retreat lasted a fortnight, and on his return he found that a large number of monks had committed suicide as a result of a sermon he had preached to them before his retreat on the un-loveliness of the body. He then caused the monks to be assembled, and asked them to concentrate on breathing (S.v.320f). Sometimes the Buddha would walk from the K\u00fat\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1 to places of interest in the neighbourhood  - e.g., the S\u00e1randada-cetiya (A.iii.167) and the C\u00e1p\u00e1la-cetiya (S.v.258; A.iv.308f).

A certain monk, on his way to Jetavana, passed through the place and was asked by a pious layman to complain to the Buddha of their ill-behaviour. On hearing of it, the Buddha sent S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na to proclaim on them an act of banishment. (J.ii.387; Vin.ii.9f; iii.179f; DhA.ii.108f).

The site on which it was erected was consecrated by the visit of all the four Buddhas of this kappa and was at the upper end of the Kakudhav\u00e1pi. It was one of the spots at which Mahinda scattered campaka flowers by way of homage, and the earth trembled. When Mahinda informed Dev\u00e1nampiyatissa of the great sanctity of the spot and of its suitability for a Th\u00fapa, Tissa immediately wished to build the Th\u00fapa himself, but Mahinda bade him desist, telling him that the work would be carried out in the future by Dutthag\u00e1mani. Tissa recorded this prophecy on a pillar of stone (Mhv.xv.51ff., 167ff). When Dutthag\u00e1mani had won his victory over the Damilas and had brought peace to the country, he saw the prophecy inscribed on the stone pillar, but was unwilling to start the work as the people were too crippled with regard to money to be able to support such an immense undertaking. But the devas read his thoughts and provided him with all the necessaries for the building of the Th\u00fapa. Prepared bricks were found on the banks of the Gambh\u00edranad\u00ed, copper near Tambapittha, silver in the Ambatthakolalena, pearls at Uruvel\u00e1, and gems in a cave near Peliv\u00e1pig\u00e1ma. The building was started on the full moon day of Vis\u00e1kha. The foundation stone was laid on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month of As\u00e1lha. Great celebrations marked the event, arrangements for which were in the hands of the ministers Vis\u00e1kha and Sirideva. Monks were present not only from all over Ceylon but from many other places: eighty thousand under Indagutta from R\u00e1jagaha, twelve thousand under Dhammasena from Isipatana, sixty thousand under Piyadass\u00ed from Jetavan\u00e1r\u00e1ma, eighteen thousand under Mah\u00e1 Buddharakkhita from Mah\u00e1vana in Ves\u00e1li, thirty thousand under Mah\u00e1 Dhammarakkhita from Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma in Kosamb\u00ed,", "forty thousand under Mah\u00e1 Sangharakkhita from Dakkhin\u00e1giri in Ujjeni, one hundred and sixty thousand under Mittinna Asok\u00e1r\u00e1ma in P\u00e1taliputta, two hundred and eighty thousand under Uttinna from Kasm\u00edra, four hundred and sixty thousand under Mah\u00e1deva from Pallabhogga, thirty thousand under Yonamah\u00e1 Dhammarakkhita from Alasand\u00e1, sixty thousand under Uttara from Vi\u00f1jh\u00e1tav\u00ed, thirty thousand under Cittagutta from Bodhimanda vih\u00e1ra, eighty thousand under Candagutta from Vanav\u00e1sa, and ninety six thousand under Suriyagutta from Kel\u00e1sa vih\u00e1ra. Of arahants alone ninety six crores were present.</p><p>As the king stepped into the space left open for him, he expressed the desire that, if his worship were to have a happy result, theras bearing the names of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Sangha, should take their places on the east, south, and west sides respectively, and a thera bearing the name of Ananda on the north side, each thera to be surrounded by a group bearing the same name. The king's wish was fulfilled; the theras in question and their companions were called Mah\u00e1 Buddharakkhita, Mah\u00e1 Dhammarakkhita, Mah\u00e1 Sangharakkhita and Mah\u00e1nanda. As the king was about to mark the space to be covered by the cetiya, the Thera Siddhattha, looking into the future, told him to define only a moderate space for the Th\u00fapa. This the king did; then, looking at the theras immediately around him, he inquired their names and rejoiced to find them so auspicious, they being Siddhattha, Mangala, Sumam, Paduma, S\u00edval\u00ed, Candagutta, Suriyagutta, Indagutta, S\u00e1gara, Mittasena, Jayasena, and Acala. He then laid the first foundation stone on the east side on sweet smelling clay prepared by Mittasena and sprinkled with water by Jayasena; Mah\u00e1sumana placed jasmine flowers on the stone. Immediately the earth trembled in wonder. The minister who helped the king to mark out the area of the cetiya was", "Suppatitthitabrahm\u00e1, son of Nandisena and Sumanadev\u00ed. At the end of the ceremony, Piyadass\u00ed preached to the assembled populace, and many attained to various fruits of the Path.</p><p>The Th\u00fapa was like a water bubble in shape; its architect was Sirivaddha and his assistant Acala. Orders were given that no unpaid work should be done in the construction of the cetiya. Arahants caused the three terraces of flower offerings to the Th\u00fapa (pupph\u00e1dh\u00e1n\u00e1) to sink nine times into the earth, in order, as they explained, to strengthen the foundations. The cetiya was one hundred and twenty cubits high, and for the ten flower terraces alone ten crores of bricks were used.</p><p>The Relic Chamber was of unparalleled magnificence, and consisted of four medavannap\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00e1, each eighty cubits in length and in breadth and eight inches thick. These were brought from Uttarakura by two s\u00e1maneras, Uttara and Sumana. In the Chamber were placed sculptural representations of the chief events connected with the Buddha's life as well as pictures of several J\u00e1takas, including the Vessantara. </p><p>For list see Mhv.xxx.71ff.; the MT (549ff.) contains a long disquisition to prove that there is no reason to doubt the account given of the contents of the Relic Chamber, for in its construction the power (iddhi) of the king, of devas, and of arahants came into play.</p><p>The work of the Relic Chamber was under the personal supervision of Indagutta Thera, of great iddhi power. When the Chamber was ready for the enshrining of the Relics, Sonuttara of P\u00faj\u00e1 parivena was entrusted with the task of obtaining them. In a previous birth, as Nanduttara, he had vowed to have the power of doing this, and now was his opportunity. He went to Ma\u00f1jerika N\u00e1ga bhavana, where the Relics, washed away from the Th\u00fapa at R\u00e1mag\u00e1ma, were in the custody of the N\u00e1ga Mah\u00e1k\u00e1la, and by a display of iddhi power obtained them", "from the N\u00e1ga against his desire. They represented one dona of the Buddha's Relics, and the Buddha had predicted that they would ultimately be placed in the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa. These Relics were enshrined on the fifteenth uposatha day in the light half of the month of \u00c1s\u00e1lha, under the constellation of Uttar\u00e1s\u00e1lha. Many devas and brahmas and n\u00e1gas were present as on the day of the Buddha's Enlightenment, and ninety six crores of arahants attended the ceremony. As the king, after passing three times round the cetiya, ascended it on the east side, and was about to descend into the Relic Chamber, bearing on his head the Casket of Relics, the casket opened and the Relics rose out of it, and taking on the form of the Buddha, performed the Twin Miracle, as at the foot of the Gandamba. When the Relics were placed on the couch prepared for them they assumed, as the king had desired, the form of the Buddha as he lay on his death bed. For a whole week the celebrations lasted, and during this period the king offered to the Relics the dominion of Ceylon, and Indagutta decreed that the people of Ceylon, wherever they might be, should be able immediately to visit the Th\u00fapa should they desire to do so. At the end of the seven days, the two s\u00e1maneras, Uttara and Sumana, closed the Chamber with the medavannap\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00e1 set apart for the purpose, while arahants pronounced that flowers offered in the Relic Chamber should not wither, nor scents dry up; the lamps should not be extinguished nor anything whatever perish. </p><p>The building of the M\u00e1ha Th\u00fapa is described in Mhv. chaps xxviii-xxx.; MT. 514 83; Dpv.xix.1ff.; also Th\u00fapavamsa (pp. 66ff.).</p><p>The treasures enshrined in the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa were worth twenty crores, the rest cost one thousand crores (Mhv.xxxii.18).</p><p>Before the parasol of the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa and the plaster work could be completed, Dutthag\u00e1mani fell ill, and his brother, Saddh\u00e1tissa,", "summoned from D\u00edghav\u00e1pi, contrived with great skill to make the Th\u00fapa look complete, that the king might see it before he died. After the king's obsequies had been performed, in a place within sight of the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa (Mhv.xxxii.58), Saddh\u00e1tissa finished the work yet remaining and established celebrations to be performed three times daily at the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa (Mhv.xxxii.60; Mhv.xxxiii.5). La\u00f1jatissa levelled the ground between the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa and the Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma and built three stone terraces at the cost of three hundred thousand (Mhv.xxxiii.22f). Khall\u00e1tan\u00e1ga made the courtyard of sand, surrounded by a wall (Mhv.xxxiii.31). Bh\u00e1tika constructed two vedik\u00e1 round the courtyard (Mhv.xxxiv.39). It is said (MT. 553f) that Bh\u00e1tika was taken by the arahants into the Relic Chamber, and he held great celebrations in its honour (see Bh\u00e1tik\u00e1bhaya). Mah\u00e1d\u00e1thika Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ga converted the sand courtyard into a wide court laid out with ki\u00f1cakkha stones on plaster (Mhv.xxxiv.69), while Amandag\u00e1mani erected a parasol over the cetiya (Mhv.xxxv.2) and Ilan\u00e1ga made the Lambakannas construct a roadway leading up to the Mah\u00e1, Th\u00fapa (Mhv.xxxiv.17). Sirin\u00e1ga had the whole Th\u00fapa gilded and crowned with a new parasol (Mhv.xxxvi.24), this work being undertaken again later by Sanghatissa (Mhv.xxxvi.65), while Sanghabodhi made rain to pour down by means of prostrating himself in the courtyard (Mhv.xxxvi.75). Jetthatissa offered two precious gems to the Th\u00fapa (Mhv.xxxvi.126), while Aggabodhi I. placed on the Th\u00fapa a golden umbrella (Cv.xlii.32), From this time onward the country passed through very troublous times and the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa was neglected. But it was restored by Parakkamab\u00e1hu I. (Cv.lxxiv.10; lxxvi.106f; lxxviii.97) and again by Kittinissanka (Cv.lxxx.20); it was later pillaged by M\u00e1gha (Cv.lxxx.68), and remained neglected till the time of Parakkamab\u00e1hu II., who started the work of", "reconstruction (Cv.lxxxvii.66), which was completed by his son Vijayab\u00e1hu IV.

There seems to have been a hall for pilgrims to the west of the cetiya (Vibh\u00e1.446). When the Buddha's s\u00e1sana disappears, all the Relics of the Buddha deposited in various cetiyas all over Ceylon will gather together at the Mah\u00e1cetiya, and from there will go to the Raj\u00e1yatana cetiya in N\u00e1gad\u00edpa, thence to the, Mah\u00e1bodhipallanka, where all the Relics, assembled from everywhere, will take the form of the Buddha seated at the foot of the Bodhi tree.

The Buddhists, evidently, merely adopted the brahmin tradition in this matter as in so many others. But they went further. In the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/l/lakkhana_s')\">Lakkhana Sutta</a> (D.iii.142ff) they sought to explain how these marks arose, and maintained that they were due entirely to good deeds done in a former birth and could only be continued in the present life by means of goodness. Thus the marks are merely incidental; most of them are so absurd, considered as the marks of a human being, that they are probably mythological in origin, and a few of them seem to belong to solar myths, being adaptations to a man, of poetical epithets applied to the sun or even to the personification of human sacrifice. Some are characteristic of human beauty, and one or two may possibly be reminiscences of personal bodily peculiarities possessed by some great man, such as Gotama himself.</p><p>Apart from these legendary beliefs, the Buddha had his own theory of the attributes of a Mah\u00e1purisa as explained in the Mah\u00e1purisa Sutta (S.v.158) and the Vassak\u00e1ra Sutta (A.ii.35f).</p><p>Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.761) that when the time comes for the birth of a Buddha, the Suddh\u00e1v\u00e1sa Brahm\u00e1s visit the earth in the guise of", "brahmins and teach men about these bodily signs as forming part of the Vedic teaching so that thereby auspicious men may recognize the Buddha.

Sakka expresses his joy in a song and then utters an eulogy on the eight qualities of the Buddha. Brahm\u00e1 Sanankum\u00e1ra appears and desires to hear the eulogy, which is, accordingly, repeated for his benefit. Sanankum\u00e1ra says that the Buddha has ever been thus wise, and tells the story of Disampati and his son Renu. Disampati has a purohita called Govinda and when he dies Disampati is distressed, but, at the suggestion of Renu, appoints Govinda's son Jotip\u00e1la in his place.</p><p>On the death of Disampati Renu becomes king, and, with Jotip\u00e1la's help, divides his kingdom into seven to be shared by himself and six of his friends, the divisions of the kingdom being Dantapura, Potana, M\u00e1hissati, Roruka, Mithil\u00e1, Camp\u00e1 and B\u00e1r\u00e1nasi; and the kings, respectively, are: Sattabh\u00fa, Brahmadatta, Vessabh\u00fa, Bharata, Renu and two Dhataratthas. Jotip\u00e1la, now called Mah\u00e1govinda by virtue of his post, trains seven others to fill the posts of stewards to the seven kings. Mah\u00e1govinda acquires the reputation of having seen Brahm\u00e1 face to face, and, in order to justify this reputation, he takes leave of Renu and practises meditation for four months. During his meditation, Sanankum\u00e1ra appears before him and tells him that he may see Brahm\u00e1 face to face and attain communion with him. Here we have the teaching regarding the ideal brahmin.

The child was born with a medicinal plant in his hand, and was therefore called Mahosadha. He talked immediately after birth, and it is said that, on the day of his conception, Videha, king of Mithil\u00e1, dreamed a dream, which presaged the birth of a sage. From early childhood Mahosadha gave evidence of unusual ability, and one of his first acts was to build a large hall and lay out a garden with the help of his companions. The king wished to have him in the court though he was only seven years old, but was dissuaded by his wise men. But he sent a councillor to watch the boy and report of his doings from time to time. When the king was fully convinced (the J\u00e1taka gives an account of nineteen problems solved by Mahosadha) that Mahosadha was undoubtedly endowed with unusual wisdom, he sent for him in spite of the counsel of his ministers -  Senaka, Pukkusa, K\u00e1v\u00ednda and Devinda-  and appointed him as his fifth councillor. One day, Mahosadha saved the queen Udumbar\u00e1 (q.v.) from the unjust wrath of the king, and ever after she was his firm and loyal friend. After his entry into the court, Mahosadha was on many occasions called upon to match his wit against that of the senior councillors, and on each occasion he emerged triumphant. E.g., in the Mendakapa\u00f1ha (q.v.) and the Sirimandapa\u00f1ha (q.v.). </p><p>When aged sixteen he married Amar\u00e1dev\u00ed. She was a wise woman, and frustrated many attempts of Mahosadha's enemies to embroil him with the king. Once they stole various things from the palace and sent them to her. She accepted them, and made assignations with each of the donors. When they arrived she had them seized, their heads shaved, and themselves thrown into the", "jakes, where she tormented them, and then arraigned them before the king with the stolen goods. Mahosadha, aware of the plots against him, lay in hiding, and the deity of the king's parasol put several questions to the king, knowing that none but Mahosadha could answer them. The king sent men to seek him, and he was discovered working for a potter. The king showed him all honour, and obtained from him the answers to the deity's questions.</p><p>But his enemies continued to plot against him, until orders were given by the king that he should be killed the next day. Udumbar\u00e1, discovered this and warned him. But in the meantime he had discovered the guilty secrets of his enemies: Senaka had killed a courtesan, Pukkusa had a leprous spot on his thigh, K\u00e1vinda was possessed by a yakkha named Naradeva, and Devinda had stolen the king's most precious gem. Mahosadha posted these facts everywhere in the city, and the next day went boldly into the palace. The king professed innocence of any evil intentions against him; but Mahosadha exposed the schemes of them all, and Senaka and the others were only saved from severe punishment by the intervention of Mahosadha himself. Thenceforward Mahosadha was Videha's trusted councillor, and took various measures to increase his royal master's power and glory. Spies were sent to every court, whence they brought home reports. Mahosadha also had a parrot whom he employed to ferret out the most baffling secrets. While returning from a visit to Sankhapala, king of Ekabala, the parrot passed through Uttarapa\u00f1c\u00e1la and there overheard a conversation between C\u00falani Brahmadatta, king of Kampilla, and his purohita Kevatta, wherein the latter unfolded a scheme for capturing the whole of Jambud\u00edpa. Kevatta was too wise to allow Brahmadatta, to attack Mithil\u00e1, knowing of Mahosadha's power, but Mahosadha deliberately provoked Brahmadatta by sending his men to upset a", "feast he had prepared, during which he had planned to poison the hundred princes whom he had brought under subjection. Brahmadatta then set out to attack Mithil\u00e1. He laid siege to the city, and adopted various ways of compelling the citizens to surrender. But Mahosadha was more than a match for him, and found means of defeating all his plans. In the end Mahosadha engaged the services of Anukevatta, who, pretending to be a traitor to Mithil\u00e1, went over to the army of Brahmadatta and, gaining the king's confidence, informed him that Kevatta and all the other counsellors of Brahmadatta had accepted bribes from Mahosadha. The king listened to him, and on his advice raised the siege and fled to his own city.</p><p>But Kevatta planned revenge, and, a year later, he persuaded Brahmadatta to send poets to Videha's city, singing songs of the peerless beauty of the daughter of Brahmadatta, Pa\u00f1c\u00e1lacand\u00ed. Videha heard the songs and sent a proposal of marriage, and Kevatta came to Mithil\u00e1 to arrange the day. Videha suggested that Kevatta should meet Mahosadha to discuss the plans, but Mahosadha feigned illness, and when Kevatta arrived at his house, he was grossly insulted by Mahosadha's men. When Kevatta had left, Videha consulted Mahosadha, but would not be dissuaded from his plan to marry Pa\u00f1c\u00e1lacand\u00ed. Finding that he could do nothing with the king, Mahosadha sent his parrot Matthara to find out what he could from the maynah bird which lived in Brahmadatta's bedchamber. Matthara used all his wits and won the favour of the maynah and learnt from her of Kevatta's plan, which he repeated to Mahosadha.</p><p>With Videha's leave, Mahosadha went on Uttarapa\u00f1c\u00e1la to, as he said, make preparations for the wedding. But he gave orders for a village to be built on every league of ground along the road, and gave instructions to the shipwright, Anandakum\u00e1ra, to build and hold ready three hundred ships. At", "Uttarapa\u00f1c\u00e1la he was received with great honour, and obtained the king's permission to build in the city a palace for Videha. The king gave him a free hand, and be immediately started to threaten to pull down houses belonging to various people, from the queen mother downwards, and obtained money from them as bribes to spare their houses. Having reported to the king that no suitable spot was available within the city, he obtained his consent to erect a palace outside the city, between that and the Ganges. All access was forbidden to the site on penalty of a large sum, and having first erected a village called Gaggali for his workmen, elephants, etc., Mahosadha started to dig a tunnel, the mouth of which was in the Ganges. The tunnel, a marvellous place, was duly constructed, fitted with all manner of machinery, and beautifully decorated. A smaller tunnel was dug, leading into the larger, one opening, which was, however, concealed, giving access to the king's palace. The task occupied four months, and when all preparations were complete, Mahosadha sent word to Videha.</p><p>Videha arrived at Brahmadatta's court, and a great feast was held in his honour at Upak\u00e1r\u00ed, the palace which had been prepared for his residence. While the feast was in progress, Mahosadha sent men by the smaller tunnel to the palace and bade them fetch Talat\u00e1 (the queen mother), the queen Nand\u00e1, and Pa\u00f1c\u00e1lacand\u00ed, on the pretext that they had been sent for by Brahmadatta to take part in the festivities as Videha and Mahosadha had both been killed, according to plan. Meanwhile Brahmadatta had given orders that the whole city should be surrounded. Videha was overcome with fright on discovering what was happening, but he put himself into Mahosadha's hands. The latter led him into the large tunnel, and there he was brought face to face with the members of Brahmadatta's family, who had already been conducted thither.", "Pa\u00f1c\u00e1lacand\u00ed was placed upon a heap of treasure and married to Videha. On emerging from the tunnel, they were placed on board a waiting ship, with T\u00e1lat\u00e1 and Nand\u00e1, and sent away into safety, escorted by the other ships, Mahosadha himself remaining behind in Uttarapa\u00f1c\u00e1la.</p><p>The next day, Brahmadatta came with his army to Upak\u00e1ri, hoping to capture Videha. There Mahosadha revealed to him what had happened, and, in due course, persuaded him to forget his wrath and inspect the tunnel. While in the tunnel Brahmadatta expressed his remorse for having listened to the evil advice of Brahmadatta, and he and Mahosadha swore eternal friendship. Mahosadha returned to Mithil\u00e1, taking with him Brahmadatta's dowry for his daughter; the members of Brahmadatta's family returned to Uttarapa\u00f1c\u00e1la, and the two kings lived in great amity.</p><p>Videha died ten years later, and in fulfilment of a promise made to Brahmadatta, Mahosadha went to Uttarapa\u00f1c\u00e1la. There Nand\u00e1, who had never forgiven him, tried to poison the king's mind against him; but this plot was frustrated by a religious woman, Bher\u00ed (q.v.), and Brahmadatta remained his firm friend, loving him, as he confessed to Bheri, more than any of his own family.</p><p>The J\u00e1taka was related to illustrate the Buddha's great wisdom.  </p><ul>  <li>Uppalavann\u00e1 is identified with Bher\u00ed,  </li>  <li>Suddhodana with Sirivaddhaka,  </li>  <li>Maham\u00e1y\u00e1 with Suman\u00e1dev\u00ed,  </li>  <li>Bimb\u00e1dev\u00ed with Amar\u00e1,  </li>  <li>Ananda with Matthara,  </li>  <li>S\u00e1riputta with C\u00falani Brahmadatta,  </li>  <li>Devadatta with Kevatta,  </li>  <li>Culla Nandik\u00e1 with Talat\u00e1,  </li>  <li>Sundar\u00ed with Pa\u00f1c\u00e1lacand\u00ed,  </li>  <li>Yasassik\u00e1 with Nand\u00ed,  </li>  <li>Ambattha with K\u00e1vinda,", "</li>  <li>Potthap\u00e1tda with Pukkusa,  </li>  <li>Pilotika with Devinda,  </li>  <li>Saccaka with Senaka,  </li>  <li>Ditthamangalik\u00e1 with Udumbar\u00e1,  </li>  <li>Kundal\u00ed with the maynah bird, and  </li>  <li>L\u00e1l\u00fad\u00e1y\u00ed with King Videha.</li></ul><p>The story occupies J.iv., pp. 329 478, in Fausb\u00f6ll's edition; what is given here is merely an extremely short summary; cp.

L\u00e1lud\u00e1yi interrupts and is rebuked by the Buddha, who explains that the question was essentially a triple one and should have been so answered. If a man's purposeful act is calculated to produce a pleasant feeling, his experience is pleasant; if an unpleasant feeling, unpleasant; if neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it is neither. Ananda asks him to explain further, and this he does. A man may be wicked in this world and yet, at death, pass either into heaven or into hell, he may be good yet go into hell or into heaven. But one should not rush to conclusions from this truth, because the consequence of man's action, good or bad, may be felt either here and now, in the next birth, or at some other time. Kamma can be divided into four classes: </p><ul>  <li>(1) not only in operation, but also having the   appearance of being so; </li>  <li>(2) in operation, though not appearing so; </li>  <li>(3) in operation, and appearing so; </li>  <li>(4) not in operation, and not appearing so.

At first the differences between these two factions were trivial, but, as time went on, Abhayagiri grew in power and riches and proved a formidable rival to the older monastery.</p><p>From time to time various kings and nobles made additions and restorations to the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra. Thus Vasabha (Mhv.xxxxv.88) built a row of cells, and Bh\u00e1tikatissa erected a boundary wall (Mhv.xxxvi.2), while Kanitthatissa removed the boundary wall and constructed the Kukkutagiri parivena, twelve large p\u00e1s\u00e1das, a refectory, and a road leading from Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra to Dakkhinavih\u00e1ra (Mhv.xxxvi.10f).

They obtained the assistance of a Cola monk, named Sanghatissa, and at a solemn assembly of the monks concerned, at Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma, Sanghamitta expounded his heretical doctrine, refuting the opposition of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra monks, and succeeded in winning over the king, who was present, in spite of the efforts of his uncle, Goth\u00e1bhaya Thera, to bring him round to the orthodox party. Sanghamitta became tutor to the king's sons, and when one of these, Mah\u00e1sena, became king, he prompted him to destroy the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra. A royal decree was issued forbidding the giving of alms to the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra. The monks thereupon left the monastery, and for nine years it remained deserted. Many of the buildings", "were destroyed, and various possessions belonging to the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra were removed to Abhayagiri; but the people, led by the king's minister and friend, Meghavann\u00e1bhaya, revolted against the impious deeds of Mah\u00e1sena and his admirers, Sanghamitta and Sona, and the king was forced to yield. Sanghamitta and Sona were slain by one of the queens, and the king, with the help of Meghavann\u00e1bhaya, rebuilt several parivenas and restored some of the possessions, which had been removed. But Mah\u00e1sena's allegiance to the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra teaching was not lasting; acting on the advice of a monk named Tissa, he built the Jetavanavih\u00e1ra in the grounds of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra, against the wish of the monks there; the latter left again for nine months as a sign of protest against the king's attempts to remove the boundary of the vih\u00e1ra. This attempt, however, he was forced to abandon (Mhv.xxxvi.110f.; xxxvii.1 37).</p><p>Mah\u00e1sena's son, Sirimeghavanna, on coming to the throne, exerted himself to undo the damage which had been wrought by his father. He rebuilt the Lohap\u00e1s\u00e1da and restored all the demolished parivenas, together with their endowments (Cv.xxxvii.54ff). Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra had, by now, become famous as a seat of learning; it was the centre of Therav\u00e1da Buddhism, and was the repository of various Commentaries, of which the chief were the S\u00edhalatthakath\u00e1 on the P\u00e1li Canon. Thither, therefore, came scholars from various countries, among them Buddhaghosa (q.,v.), who resided in the Ganth\u00e1kara parivena and compiled his P\u00e1li Commentaries (Cv.xxxvii.215ff).</p><p>When Dh\u00e1tusena became king he had the walls of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra painted with various ornamental designs (Cv.xxxviii.43).

By mutual consent, however, the marriage was not consummated, the two spending the night separated by a chain of flowers. Pippali had immense wealth; he used twelve measures of perfumed powder daily, each measure a Magadhan\u00e1li, for his person alone. He had sixty lakes with water works attached, and his workmen occupied fourteen villages, each as large as <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura')\">Anur\u00e1dhapura</a>. </p><p>One day he went to a field, which was being ploughed and saw the birds eating the worms turned up by the plough.

But soon they agreed that it was not seemly they should walk thus together, as each must prove a hindrance to the other. And so, at the cross roads, he took the right and she the left and the earth trembled to see such virtue.</p><p>The Buddha, sitting in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')\">Gandhakuti</a> in <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')\">Veluvana</a>, knew what the earthquake signified, and having walked three g\u00e1vutas (this journey of the Buddha is often referred to -  e.g., MA.i.347, 357), sat down at the foot of the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/bahuputta')\">Bahuputtaka Nigrodha</a>, between <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')\">R\u00e1jagaha</a> and <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa')\">N\u00e1land\u00e1</a>, resplendent in all the glory of a Buddha. Pippali (henceforth called Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, no explanation is to be found anywhere as to why he is called Kassapa; it was probably his gotta name, but see Ap.ii.583, vs.56) saw the Buddha, and recognising him at once as his teacher, prostrated himself before him. The Buddha told him to be seated, and, in three homilies, gave him his ordination.</p><p>The three homilies are given at S.ii.220, \"Thus Kassapa must thou train thyself: </p><ul>  <li>(1) 'There shall be a lively sense of fear and regard (hirotappa)   towards all monks, seniors, novices, and those of middle status.' </li>", "<li>(2) 'Whatever doctrine I shall hear bearing upon what   is good, to all that I will hearken with attentive ear, digesting it,   pondering it, gathering it all up with my will.' </li>  <li>(3) 'Happy mindfulness with respect to the body shall   not be neglected by me.'\"</li></ul><p>Together they returned to R\u00e1jagaha, Kassapa, who bore on his body seven of the thirty two marks of a Great Being, following the Buddha. On the way, the Buddha desired to sit at the foot of a tree by the roadside, and Kassapa folded for him his outer robe (pilotikasangh\u00e1ti) as a seat. The Buddha sat on it and, feeling it with his hand, praised its softness. Kassapa asked him to accept it. \"And what would you wear?\" inquired the Buddha. Kassapa then begged that he might be given the rag robe worn by the Buddha. \"It is faded with use,\" said the Buddha, but Kassapa said he would prize it above the whole world and the robes were exchanged. (The robe which Kassapa exchanged with the Buddha was Punn\u00e1's cloak. See <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaa')\">Punn\u00e1 6</a>).</p><p>This incident Kassapa always recalled with pride, e.g. S.ii.221. It is said that the Buddha paid him this great honour because he knew that Kassapa would hold a recital after his death, and thus help in the perpetuation of his religion, SA.ii.130. The earth quaked again in recognition of Kassapa's virtues, for no ordinary being would have been fit to wear the Buddha's cast off robe. Kassapa, conscious of the great honour, took upon himself the thirteen austere vows (dhutagun\u00e1) and, after eight days, became an arahant.</p><p>In the past Kassapa and Bhadd\u00e1 had been husband and wife and companions in good works in many births. In the time of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara')\">Padumuttara</a> Buddha Kassapa was a very rich householder named Vedeha and married to Bhadd\u00e1, and very", "devoted to the Buddha. One day he heard the Buddha's third disciple in rank (Nisabha) being awarded the place of pre eminence among those who observed austere practices, and registered a wish for a similar honour for himself in the future. He learnt from the Buddha of the qualities in which Nisabha excelled the Buddha himself, and determined to obtain them. With this end in view, during birth after birth, he expended all his energies in goods deeds. Ninety one kappas ago; in the time of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')\">Vipass\u00ed</a> Buddha, he was the brahmin<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekasaataka')\">Ekas\u00e1taka</a> and Bhadd\u00e1 was his wife. In the interval between <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ku/konaagamana')\">Kon\u00e1gamana</a> and <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa')\">Kassapa</a> Buddhas he was a setthiputta. He married Bhadd\u00e1, but because of an evil deed she had done in the past (see Bhadd\u00e1 K\u00e1pil\u00e1n\u00ed), she became unattractive to him and he left her, taking her as wife again when she became attractive. Having seen from what had happened to his wife how great was the power of the Buddhas, the setthiputta wrapped Kassapa Buddha's golden cetiya with costly robes and decked it with golden lotuses, each the size of a cartwheel.  </p><p>The Ther\u00ed Apad\u00e1na (Ap.ii.582. vs. 47-51) gives an account of two more of his lives, one as Sumitta and the other as Koliyaputta, in both of which he and his wife ministered to Pacceka Buddhas.</p><p>In the next birth he was <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda')\">Nanda</a>, king of Benares, and, because he had given robes in past lives, he had thirty two kapparukkhas, which provided him and all the people of his kingdom with garments. At the suggestion of his queen, he made preparations to feed holy men, and five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, sons of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumaa')\">Padum\u00e1</a>, came to accept his gift. In that life, too,", "Nanda and his queen renounced the world and became ascetics, and having developed the jh\u00e1nas, were reborn in the Brahma world. </p><p>This account of Kassapa's last life and his previous life is compiled from AA.i.92ff.; SA.ii.135ff.; ThagA.ii.134ff.; Ap.ii.578ff.

It was then the seventh day after the Buddha's death, and the Mallas had been trying in vain to set fire to his pyre. The arahant theras, who were present, declared that it could not be kindled until Mah\u00e1 Kassapa and his five hundred companions had saluted the Buddha's feet. Mah\u00e1 Kassapa then arrived and walked three times round the pyre with bared shoulder, and it is said the Buddha's feet became visible from out of the pyre in order that he might worship them. He was followed by his five hundred colleagues, and when they had all worshipped the feet disappeared and the pyre kindled of itself (D.ii.163f).  </p><p>It is said (Mhv.xxxi.20f.; see also Vsm.430) that the relics of the Buddha which fell to Aj\u00e1tasattu's share were taken to <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')\">R\u00e1jagaha</a> by Kassapa, in view of that which would happen in the future. At <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava')\">P\u00e1v\u00e1</a> (on the announcement of the Buddha's death), Kassapa had heard the words of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhadda')\">Subhadda</a>, who, in his old age, had joined the", "Order, that they were \"well rid of the great samana and could now do as they liked.\" This remark it was which had suggested to Kassapa's mind the desirability of holding a Recital of the Buddha's teachings. He announced his intention to the assembled monks, and, as the senior among them and as having been considered by the Buddha himself to be fit for such a task, he was asked to make all necessary arrangements (e.g., DA.i.3). In accordance with his wishes, all the monks, other than the arahants chosen for the Recital, left R\u00e1jagaha during the rainy season. The five hundred who were selected met in Council under the presidency of Kassapa and recited the Dhamma and the Vinaya (DA.i.3f.; 5ff.; Sp.i.4.ff.; Mhv.iii.3ff). This recital is called the Therasangit\u00ed or <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/t/theravaada')\">Therav\u00e1da</a>.</p><p>The books contain numerous references to Mah\u00e1 Kassapa -  he is classed with <a href=\"maha_moggallana_th')\">Moggall\u00e1na</a>,<a href=\"maha_kappina_th')\">Kappina</a>, and <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha')\">Anuruddha</a> for his great iddhi-powers. E.g., S.i.114; but his range of knowledge was limited; there were certain things which even Kassapa did not know (DhA.i.258). </p><p>The Buddha regarded him as equal to himself in exhorting the monks to lead the active and zealous lives (S.ii.205), and constantly held him up as an example to others in his great contentment (S.ii.194f) and his ability to win over families by his preaching. The Buddha compares him to the moon (candopama), unobtrusive; his heart was free from bondage, and he always taught others out of a feeling of compassion. S.ii.197ff. Kassapa's freedom from any kind of attachment was, as the Buddha pointed out to the monks, due to the earnest wish he had made for that attainment in the past, \"He has no attachment", "to requisites or households or monasteries or cells; but is like a royal swan which goes down into a lake and swims there, while the water does not adhere to his body\" (DhA.ii.169f.).</p><p>The Buddha also thought him equal to himself in his power of attaining the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/jhaana')\">jh\u00e1nas</a> and abiding therein (S.ii.210ff).</p><p>Kassapa was willing to help monks along their way, and several instances are given of his exhortations to them (E.g., Thag.vss.1051-57, 1072-81, and his long sermon at A.v.161ff ); but he was evidently sensitive to criticism, and would not address them unless he felt them to be tractable and deferential to instruction. E.g., S.ii.203ff.; and at 219, when <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_nandaa')\">Thullanand\u00e1</a> finds fault with him for blaming <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')\">Ananda</a>. See below. Kassapa had good reason for not wishing to address recalcitrant monks. The<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kutiduusaka_jat_321')\">Kutid\u00fasaka J\u00e1taka</a> relates how one of his disciples,<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/u/ulunka_saddaka')\">Ulunka Saddaka</a>, angered by some admonition from Kassapa, burnt the latter's grass hut while he was away on his alms round (J.iii.71f.). </p><p>He was very reluctant to preach to the nuns, but on one occasion he allowed himself to be persuaded by Ananda, and accompanied by him he visited the nunnery and preached to the nuns. He was probably not popular among them, for, at the end of his discourse, <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_tissaa')\">Thullatiss\u00e1</a> openly reviled him for what she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ananda, \"as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker.\" (S.ii.215f) Kassapa loved Ananda dearly, and was delighted when Ananda attained arahantship", "in time to attend the First Recital, and when Ananda appeared before the arahants, it was Kassapa who led the applause (DA.i.10f). But Kassapa was very jealous of the good name of the Order, and we find him (S.ii.218f) blaming Ananda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to the criticism of the public. \"A corn trampler art thou, Ananda,\" he says, \"a despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting away,\" and ends up with \"The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure.\" Ananda, annoyed at being called \"boy,\" protests   \"Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence.\" This incident, says the Commentary took place after the Buddha's death, when Ananda, as a new arahant and with all the honour of his intimacy with the Buddha, whose bowl and robe he now possessed, had become a notable personage. SA.ii.133; Ananda regarded Kassapa in some sort of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even his name, lest it should imply disrespect (see Vin.i.92f.). </p><p>Thullanand\u00e1 heard Kassapa censuring Ananda and raised her voice in protest, \"What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can chide the learned sage Ananda?\" Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to Ananda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the Buddha for special honour.</p><p>Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done. S.ii.224f. At the First Council, when Ananda stated that the Buddha had given", "leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and contempt from the laity (Vin.ii.287f.). </p><p>Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and energetic. See also the <a href=\"mahagosinga_s')\">Mah\u00e1gosinga Sutta</a> (M.i.214), where Kassapa declares his belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to others is proved by the case of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/somamitta_thera')\">Somamitta</a> who, finding his own teacher<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vimala')\">Vimala</a> given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his guidance. </p><p>When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came after him, that they might attain to the same end. Even when he was old and the Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near him, he begged to be excused. S.ii.202f; but See <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/j/jotidaasa')\">Jotid\u00e1sa</a>, who is said to have built a vih\u00e1ra for Kassapa, and entertained him. </p><p>Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pipphaliguha')\">Pipphaliguh\u00e1</a>, the Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/b_f/bojjhanga')\">bojjhangas</a> which he had practised (S.v.78). </p><p>The knowledge that he had profited by the Master's teaching, we are told (SA.iii.128), calmed his blood and purified his system, and the sickness fell away from him \"like a drop of water from a lotus leaf.\" He", "disdained being waited upon by anybody, even by a goddess such as <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/l/laja')\">L\u00e1j\u00e1</a> , lest he should set a bad example (DhA.iii.6ff).</p><p>Owing to his great saintliness, even the gods vied with each other to give alms to Kassapa. Once when he had risen from a trance lasting seven days, five hundred nymphs, wives of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')\">Sakka</a>, appeared before him; but, snapping his fingers, he asked them to depart, saying that he bestowed his favours only on the poor. </p><p>The story of K\u00e1lavilangika is an example of Kassapa's compassion for the poor. Once, after a seven days' trance, he went to the house of K\u00e1lavilanga and received alms from his wife, which he gave to the Buddha for their greater benefit. The Buddha took a portion of this and gave the rest to five hundred monks. K\u00e1lavilangika, received only a mouthful of the food left. The Buddha said that as a result he would be a setthi within seven days. K\u00e1lavilangika told this to his wife. It happened that a few days later the king saw a man impaled alive in the place of execution; the man begged him for some food, which he agreed to send. At night, when eating, the king remembered his promise, but could find no one bold enough to go to the cemetery. On the offer of one thousand pieces, K\u00e1lavilangika's wife agreed to go in the guise of a man. On the way she was stopped by the yakkha <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighataphala')\">D\u00edghataphala</a>, who, however, later released her and gave her treasure, as did also the yakkha's father in law, the deva <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana')\">Sumana</a>. The man ate the food and, when wiping his mouth, recognised her as a woman and caught hold of her hair. But she cut off her hair, and proved to the satisfaction of the king that her mission had been accomplished. She then recovered the treasure given her by the yakkha and", "Sumana; when the king discovered her wealth, she and her husband were raised to the rank of setthi (MA.ii.812ff.).</p><p>When Sakka heard of this, he disguised himself as a weaver worn with age, and accompanied by <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaataa')\">Suj\u00e1t\u00e1</a>, transformed into an old woman, appeared in a weaver's hut along the lane where Kassapa was begging. The ruse succeeded and Kassapa accepted their alms; but, later, be discovered the truth and chided Sakka. Sakka begged forgiveness, and, on being assured that in spite of his deception the almsgiving would bring him merit, he flew into the air shouting, \"Aho d\u00e1nam, mah\u00e1 danam, Kassapassa patitthitam.\" The Buddha heard this and sympathised with Sakka in his great joy (DhA.i.423ff.; cp. Ud.iii.7). </p><p>But on one occasion so great was the importunity with which the monks of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavii')\">Alavi</a> had wearied the people, that even Mah\u00e1 Kassapa failed to get alms from them (J.ii.282). The Visuddhi Magga (403) relates a story of how once, when Kassapa was begging for alms in R\u00e1jagaha, in the company of the Buddha, on a festival day, five hundred maidens were going to the festival carrying cakes, \"round like the moon.\" They saw the Buddha but passed him by, and gave their cakes to Kassapa. The Elder made all the cakes fill just his single bowl and offered it to the Buddha (This is probably the incident referred to at Vsm.68).</p><p><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')\">S\u00e1riputta</a> seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa_sam')\">Kassapa Samyutta</a> contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibb\u00e1na (S.ii.195f), and the other on the existence of a <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/t/tathaagata')\">Tath\u00e1gata</a> after death (S.ii.222f). This regard was mutual,", "for when Kassapa saw the great honour paid to S\u00e1riputta by the devas he rejoiced greatly and broke forth into song (Thag.vs.1082 5).</p><p>Kassapa lived to be very old, and, when he died, had not lain on a bed for one hundred and twenty years. DA.ii.413; AA.ii.596; he was one hundred and twenty at the time of the First Recital (SA.ii.130).

He was older than the Buddha, and was born in a frontier kingdom three hundred yojanas in extent, in the city of Kukkutavat\u00ed. On the death of his father he became r\u00e1j\u00e1 under the name of Mah\u00e1 Kappina. His chief wife was <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anojaa')\">Anoj\u00e1</a>, from <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sagala')\">S\u00e1gala</a> in the Madda kingdom. She had been his companion in good works in past births. Every morning Mah\u00e1 Kappina would send men out of the four gates of the city to stop any scholarly or learned men who might happen to pass along the road, and then to return and tell him of them. He owned five horses: V\u00e1la, Puppha, V\u00e1lav\u00e1hana, Pupphav\u00e1hana and Supatta. Supatta he alone rode, the others were used by his messengers. One day, after the Buddha's appearance in the world, traders came from S\u00e1vatthi to Kukkutavat\u00ed and, after disposing of their goods, went to see Mah\u00e1 Kappina. He received them and asked them about their country and the teaching (s\u00e1sana) which they followed. \"Sire,\" they replied, \u201cwe cannot tell you with unwashed mouths.\" A golden jug of water was brought, and with cleansed mouths and clasped hands they told the king of the appearance of the Buddha. At the word \"Buddha\" Kappina's body was suffused with rapture. He made them utter the word three times, giving them one hundred thousand pieces. The men told him also of the Dhamma and the Sangha, and he trebled his gifts and forthwith renounced the world, followed by his ministers. They set forth to find the Buddha, and reached the bank of a river which they crossed by an \"Act of Truth,\" saying, \"If this teacher be a Samm\u00e1sambuddha, let", "not even a hoof of these horses be wetted.\" In this manner they crossed three rivers: the Aravacch\u00e1, the N\u00edlav\u00e1hana (q.v.), and the Candabh\u00e1g\u00e1. The Buddha perceived them with his divine eye, and after he had eaten at S\u00e1vatthi, went through the air to the banks of the Candabh\u00e1g\u00e1 (one hundred and twenty yojanas, says J.iv.180; see also SNA.ii.440)  and sat down under the great banyan tree facing the landing stage of the river, sending forth Buddha rays. Kappina and his men saw him and prostrated themselves. The Buddha taught them the Doctrine, and they became arahants and joined the Order, the formula \"Ehi bhikkhu\" being their sanction and their ordination. But see Vsm.393, where it says that at the end of the sermon Kappina became only an an\u00e1g\u00e1min and his followers sot\u00e1pannas.</p><p>Anoj\u00e1 and the wives of Kappina's ministers hearing that their husbands had renounced the world and gone to see the Buddha, determined to do likewise. They crossed the river in the same way as Kappina and his retinue, and approached the Buddha as he sat under the banyan tree on the banks of the Candabh\u00e1g\u00e1. The Buddha made the husbands and wives invisible to each other and preached to the latter. They became sot\u00e1pannas and were ordained by Uppalavann\u00e1, the Buddha taking the monks to Jetavana. Mah\u00e1 Kappina spent his days in the ecstasy of jh\u00e1na, and so full of happiness was he that he constantly repeated \"aho sukham, aho sukham,\" which made the monks suspect that he was longing for the pleasures of kingship which he had left behind, until the Buddha dispelled their doubts.</p><p>One day the Buddha discovered that Kappina lived inactively, enjoying his happiness, and that he never taught anybody. (Vin.i.105 records that when Kappina was in the Deer Park at Maddakucchi he wondered whether he need attend the uposatha ceremonies, since he himself was pure). The", "Buddha appeared before him, telling him to go. He sent for him and asked him to teach the Doctrine to his associates. This Kappina did, and at the end of a single sermon one thousand listening recluses became arahants, hence the title conferred on him. </p><p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Kappina had registered a vow to become chief among admonishers of monks, having seen a similar honour conferred on a disciple of the Buddha. He was at that time an assessor (akkhadassa) of Hamsavat\u00ed, and having invited the Buddha and his monks entertained them with great honour. In another birth he was a Koliyan, and waited upon five hundred Pacceka Buddhas and gave them robes. The story of the entertainment of the Pacceka Buddhas is given at length in DhA.ii.112ff., and the number given there is one thousand. They came to Benares, but the king, occupied with the ploughing festival, asked them to return on the third day. The wife of the senior weaver of a village near by heard this and invited the Pacceka Buddhas to her village, where there were one thousand artisans. On the invitation being accepted, she returned quickly to the village, told the people of what she had done, and they all made the necessary preparations, each family looking after one Pacceka Buddha. The Pacceka Buddhas, by their own wish, stayed on for three months, the same woman seeing to all their comforts. At the end of their visit, she persuaded each family to give a set of robes to its own Pacceka Buddha. The senior weaver was Kappina and his wife Anoj\u00e1. </p><p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, he was the leader of a guild of one thousand men and built a great parivena containing one thousand rooms. AA.i.175ff.; ThagA.i.507ff.; SA.ii.172ff.; DhA.ii.117ff. gives a more detailed and slightly different version; ep. Avad\u00e1nas.ii.102f.</p><p>It is said (DhA.ii.115f) that once Kassapa Buddha was", "preaching and that all the householders of Benares, with their families, went to hear him. Scarcely had they entered the monastery when there was a heavy downpour of rain. Those who had friends among the novices and monks found shelter in their cells, the others were unprotected. The senior householder then suggested that they should build a great monastery so that all might be sheltered in future; the others agreeing, he himself gave one thousand, each of the other men five hundred, and each woman two hundred and fifty. The monastery had one thousand pinnacles, and when money ran short, each gave half as much again. At the dedication ceremony the festival lasted for seven days. The senior householder's wife, Anoj\u00e1, offered the Buddha a casket of anoja flowers and placed at his feet a garment of the colour of the flowers worth one thousand, and made a wish that in future births her body should be of the colour of the anoja flower.</p><p>Although Kappina was famed as a teacher of monks, the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1, curiously enough, contains verses in which he admonishes the nuns (bhikkhuniyo) (Thag.vss. 547 556; ThagA.i.511).</p><p>Kappina is described by the Buddha as pale (? od\u00e1ta), thin, and having a prominent nose (tanukam tungan\u00e1sikam). He possessed great iddhi-powers and had attained every sam\u00e1patti, which could be attained (J.ii.284). (It was owing to his iddhi powers that he was able to follow the Buddha to the Brahma world, S.i.145; see also S.v.315, where he is described as sam\u00e1dhibh\u00e1van\u00edya). It has been remarked (Brethren, p.257 n.2) that the verses attributed to him are, for the most part, more gnomic sayings of popular philosophy than genuine Dhamma, and that they would have befitted an early Greek Pagan. Mrs. Rhys Davids (J.R.A.S. 1927, ii.p.206f; also S\u00e1kya, p.140) has an interesting theory that Kappina was Assaji\u2019s teacher.</p>", "<p>Mah\u00e1 Kappina was quite often in the company of S\u00e1riputta, and it is said (Thag.vs.1086) that once, seeing the profound homage the gods payed to his colleague, he smiled by way of congratulation.</p><p>See also Kappina Sutta.</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2><b>Mah\u00e1tittha</b></h2>  </li></ul><hr><p><b>1.

Bodhi understood, returned to his hut, and, in spite of the king's expression of remorse, left the city, promising to return later, and dwelt in a frontier village. The councillors, nervous lest Bodhi should return, informed the king that Bodhi and the queen were conspiring to slay him. Believing their words, he had the queen put to death. The queen's four sons thereupon rose in revolt, and the king was in great danger and fear. </p><p>When Bodhi heard of this, he took a dried monkey skin, went to Benares, and stayed again in the royal park. The king came to do him honour, but Bodhi sat silent, stroking the monkey skin. The king asked him why he did so. He answered, \"This monkey was of the greatest service to me; I", "travelled about on its back, it carried my water pot, swept out my dwelling, and performed various other duties for me; in the end, through its simplicity, I ate its flesh and now I sit and lie on its skin.\"  </p><blockquote><p>(He had used the skin for his garment, hence \"I sat on the monkey's back\"; he had the skin on his shoulder, whence his water pot was suspended, hence \"it carried the water pot\"; he had swept the cell with the skin, hence \"swept my dwelling place\"; he had eaten the flesh of the monkey, hence \"I ate its flesh\").  </p></blockquote><p>The councillors who were present made great uproar, calling him a murderer and a traitor. But Bodhi knew that of these councillors, one denied the effect of all kamma, one attributed everything to a Supreme Being, one believed that everything was a result of past actions, one believed in annihilation, and one held the khattiya doctrine that one should secure one's interests, even to the extent of killing one's parents. He, therefore, argued with one after another, and proved that in accordance with their doctrines no blame whatever attached to him for having killed the monkey. Having thus completed their discomfiture, he exhorted the king not to trust in slanderers, and asked the king's sons to obtain their father's pardon. The king wished the councillors to be killed, but Bodhi intervened, and they were disgraced and exiled from the kingdom, their hair fastened in five locks.</p><p>The story was related in the same circumstances as the <a href=\"mahaummagga_jat_546')\">Mah\u00e1ummagga J\u00e1taka</a>.

He expelled her from the palace, and as she wandered about in the streets, deprived of all her glory, an old woman had pity on her, took her home, and looked after her. The king was bathing in the river when the caskets containing the children got entangled in his nets, and, having taken them out and unlocked them, he found the babes inside, together with a letter from <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')\">Sakka</a> saying that they were the children of Padumavat\u00ed. The king hastened back to his palace and issued a proclamation that anyone finding Padumavat\u00ed would receive one thousand as reward. On Padumavat\u00ed's suggestion, the old woman, her protector, offered to find her, and Padumavat\u00ed then revealed herself. She was conducted back to the palace in all glory, and her five hundred rivals were given to her as slaves. She had them freed, and appointed them as nurses to look after her children, except Paduma (called Mah\u00e1paduma), whom she nursed herself.

On one such occasion Sakka showed him great honour, falling at his feet, and the Buddha explained that this was because Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na kept his senses well guarded.</p><p>The Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.854) records a curious story in reference to Kacc\u00e1na.

The day arrived when he killed the cook himself and ate his flesh. Some time after he fell upon a brahmin traveling through the forest with a large retinue, and they gave chase to the king. As he ran an acacia splinter pierced his foot, causing him great pain. Seeing a banyan tree, he made a vow to bathe its trunk with the blood of one hundred and one princes if his foot were healed in seven days. The foot did heal within that time, and with the assistance of a Yakkha, who had been his friend in a previous birth, he managed to capture one hundred kings whom he hung on the tree by means of cords passed through their hands.</p>", "<p>The deity of the tree was alarmed and, on the advice of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')\">Sakka</a>, appeared before the man eater (who is called in the context Poris\u00e1da) and demanded that he should bring Sutasoma, Prince of Kuru, to complete the number of his victims. Sutasoma had been the man eater's friend and private tutor (pitth\u00e1cariya) at Takkasil\u00e1. Anxious to appease the deity, the man eater went to Sutasoma's park and there waited for him hidden in the pond, when Sutasoma came to take his ceremonial bath on the festival day of Phussa. On the way to the park, Sutasoma met a brahmin, <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda')\">Nanda</a>, who offered, for four thousand pieces, to teach him four verses learnt from Kassapa Buddha. Sutasoma promised to learn them on his return from the park, but there he was caught by the Poris\u00e1da. Promising to return to the Poris\u00e1da, Sutasoma obtained leave to keep his appointment with Nanda. This promise fulfilled, Sutasoma returned to the Poris\u00e1da and went with him to the banyan tree. There he told the Poris\u00e1da of the verses he had learnt from Nanda, reciting them to him, and discoursing on the virtues of Truth. The Poris\u00e1da was greatly pleased and offered Sutasoma four boons. Sutasoma chose as his first boon that the Poris\u00e1da should live for one hundred years; as his second that the captive kings should be released; as his third, that their kingdoms should be restored; and as his fourth that the Poris\u00e1da should give up his cannibalism. Only very reluctantly did the Poris\u00e1da agree to the fourth. Sutasoma then took him back to Benares, where he restored to him his kingdom, having first assured the people that the king would never return to his former vicious habits. Sutasoma then returned to Indapatta.

It is said (Sp.ii.474f.; referred to at DhSA.399) that when news arrived that the brigand Abhaya was coming to Cetiyagiri to pillage it, the patrons of the vih\u00e1ra informed Abhaya Thera of this. He asked them to collect various kinds of food and drink wherewith to entertain the brigand. The latter was greatly pleased, and, on learning that this hospitality was shown him at the instigation of Abhaya Thera, he visited the Elder and took upon himself the protection of the vih\u00e1ra from all danger. Later the monks questioned the right of the Elder to entertain a robber with what belonged to the vih\u00e1ra, but he convened an assembly of the monks and convinced them that he was guiltless, as his act had been solely for the protection of the belongings of the Sangha. This story shows that the Elder lived at Cetiyagiri.</p><p>On another occasion (MA.i.65f) Abhaya Thera preached the Mah\u00e1 Ariyavamsa patipad\u00e1, and the whole village (? Mah\u00e1g\u00e1ma) came to hear him. After the sermon he received great honour. An elderly monk was full of envy and abused him, saying that under guise of preaching he had filled the night with noise. The two monks had to travel along the same road for the distance of a g\u00e1vuta, and all the way the old monk abused Abhaya. When their roads separated, Abhaya worshipped the monk and took leave of him and said, when asked later, that he had heard none of the abuse because he had been all the time engaged in meditation. One day, a certain woman who had come all the way from Ullabha kolakannik\u00e1, a distance of five leagues, to hear", "Abhaya preach the Ariyavamsa, found that he was about to arise without finishing the sermon, and reminded him that he was omitting the most important part. The monk praised her and continued to preach till dawn, when the woman became a sot\u00e1panna (AA.i.386). It is said that once Abhaya wanted to know if a certain pindap\u00e1tika monk were a putthujjana or not. While this monk was bathing at the mouth of the Kaly\u00e1n\u00ed River, Abhaya told a novice to dive into the water and catch hold of his foot. The monk, thinking it was a crocodile, screamed with fear, and Abhaya knew that he was a puthujjana (MA.ii.869). Thieves once bound an Elder with creepers and made him lie down. A jungle fire spread to him, but before the creepers could be cut, he established insight and died an arahant. Abhaya, coming along with five hundred others, saw the body, cremated it, and had a shrine built over the remains (Vsm.36).</p><p>Abhaya's opinion was evidently greatly respected, and he is mentioned as having been consulted by Maha Dhammarakhita (VibhA.81) and Mallaka (Vsm.266) on problems connected with the Abhidhamma.</p><p>Abhaya is mentioned among those who could remember very early incidents in their lives. When he was only nine days old, his mother bent down to embrace him, but her hair became loose and the sumana-flowers she wore on her head fell on him, hurting him.

Moggall\u00e1na went to the hamlet of Kallav\u00e1la (for details see Pacala Sutta, A.iv.85f, where the village is called Kallav\u00e1lamutta) in Magadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness overcame him as he sat meditating.

The monks were offended that newcomers should be shown such great honour.

Moggall\u00e1na had been a householder, named Sirivaddha, and S\u00e1riputta a householder, called Sarada. Sarada gave away his immense wealth and became an ascetic. The Buddha visited him in his hermitage, where Sarada and his seventy four thousand pupils showed him great honour. Anomadass\u00ed's chief disciple, Nisabha, gave thanks, and Sarada made a vow that he would become the chief disciple of some future Buddha. Anomadass\u00ed saw that his wish would be fulfilled and told him so.</p><p>After the Buddha's departure, Sarada went to Sirivaddka, and, announcing the Buddha's prophecy, advised Sirivaddha to wish for the place of second disciple.

In the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saccavibhanga_sutta')\">Saccavibhanga Sutta</a> (M.iii.248) the Buddha thus distinguishes these \"twin brethren\" from the others: \"S\u00e1riputta is as she who brings forth and Moggall\u00e1na is as the nurse of what is brought forth; S\u00e1riputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggall\u00e1na trains in the highest good.

He could create a living shape innumerable times and could transfer himself into any shape at will. Thag.vs.1183; he is recorded as saying that he could crush <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/sineru')\">Sineru</a> like a kidney bean (DhA.iii.212), and, rolling the earth like a mat between his fingers, could make it rotate like a potter's wheel, or could place the earth on Sineru like an umbrella on its stand.

Once, at the Buddha's request, with his great toe he shook the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada')\">Mig\u00e1ram\u00e1tup\u00e1s\u00e1da</a>, and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper storey.

Again, Moggall\u00e1na is mentioned as visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance of Baka Brahm\u00e1. He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the Sudhamm\u00e1-Hall in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views were erroneous. Thag.vs.1198; ThagA.ii.185; S.i.144f. ; other visits of his to the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa Brahm\u00e1 (A.iii.331ff.; iv.75ff.; cp. Mtu.i.54ff.). </p><p>In the M\u00e1ratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.332ff) we are told how M\u00e1ra worried Moggall\u00e1na by entering into his belly, but Moggall\u00e1na ordered him out and told him how he himself had once been a M\u00e1ra named D\u00fas\u00ed whose sister", "K\u00e1l\u00ed was the mother of the present M\u00e1ra. D\u00fas\u00ed incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.</p><p>But, according to the Commentaries (E.g., ThagA.ii.188ff), Moggall\u00e1na's greatest exhibition of iddhi power was the subjugation of the N\u00e1ga Nandopananda. No other monk could have survived the ordeal because no other was able to enter so rapidly into the fourth jh\u00e1na; which was the reason why the Buddha would give permission to no other monk but Moggall\u00e1na to quell the N\u00e1ga's pride. Similar, in many ways, was his subjection of the N\u00e1ga who lived near the hermitage of Aggidatta (DhA.iii.242) (q.v.). Moggall\u00e1na could see, without entering into any special state of mind, petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye (See, e.g., DhA.ii.64; iii.60, 410f., 479; S.ii.254ff.; where he saw petas while in the company of Lakkhana; cp. Avad\u00e1nas i.246ff.). He would visit various worlds and bring back to the Buddha reports of their inhabitants (see also Mtu.i.4ff. regarding his visit to the Nirayas), which the Buddha used in illustration of his sermons. The Vim\u00e1navatthu (see also DhA.iii.291, re Nandiya, and iii.314) contains a collection of stories of such visits, and we are told (S.v.366f) that Moggall\u00e1na's visits to the deva worlds-  e.g., that to T\u00e1vatimsa   were very welcome to the devas.</p><p>Though Moggall\u00e1na's pre eminence was in iddhi power, yet in wisdom, too, he was second only to S\u00e1riputta. These two could answer questions within the range of no other disciple of the Buddha (DhA.iii.227). The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggall\u00e1na's powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the S\u00e1kyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggall\u00e1na, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary. And Moggall\u00e1na spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of", "them. At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly (S.iv.183ff). Mention is made elsewhere (S.iv.262-9) of eloquent sermons preached by him on the jh\u00e1nas, on qualities which lead to true emancipation (A.v.155ff), and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach. Other devas also went to hear him -  e.g., Candana, Suy\u00e1ma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti (S.iv. 269 80). He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta (E.g., S.iv.391ff), and Vappa (A.ii.196ff), eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha. When the Buddha went to preach the Abhidhamma in T\u00e1vatimsa, it was to Moggall\u00e1na that he entrusted the task of preaching to the people who were waiting for his return. Moggall\u00e1na, therefore, provided for these people spiritually, while An\u00e1thapindika looked after their bodily needs (DhA.iii.219). When the time drew near for the Buddha's return, Moggall\u00e1na, at the request of the people, went to T\u00e1vatimsa, diving into the earth and climbing Sineru, in full view of them all, in order to find out what the Buddha intended doing, so that the people might be kept informed (DhA.224; J.iv.265; cp. Dvy.375). No task, which he might be told by the Buddha to perform, seemed to Moggall\u00e1na too insignificant. Thus we find him employed by the Buddha as messenger to the arahant Uggasena, telling him that the Buddha wished to see him (Ibid., iv.62). He was also sent to Sakkhara, to Macchariya Kosiya, to check his miserliness and bring him to Jetavana (Ibid., i.369f.; J.i.347); and to S\u00edlav\u00e1, whom Aj\u00e1tasattu was plotting to kill (ThagA.i.536). When Visakh\u00e1 was building the Mig\u00e1ram\u00e1tup\u00e1s\u00e1da and the Buddha was away on one of his journeys, Moggall\u00e1na, because of his iddhi power, and five hundred monks were left to supervise the work, which was carried through without difficulty (DhA.i.414f). The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief", "disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure. There is one instance recorded of Moggall\u00e1na seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door (A.iv.204ff.). Once, when a monk charged S\u00e1riputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggall\u00e1na and Ananda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear S\u00e1riputta vindicate himself (Vin.ii.236; A.iv.374). </p><p>Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahm\u00e1 singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kok\u00e1lika monk (Kokalika had a great hatred of them -  e.g., A.v.170ff.; SN., p. 231ff.; SNA.ii.473ff). When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gay\u00e1s\u00edsa, the Buddha sent S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na to bring them back. They were successful in this mission (DhA.i.143ff.; see also DhA.ii.109f., where they were sent to admonish the Assajipunabbasuk\u00e1). Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggall\u00e1na and later born in a huge manomayak\u00e1ya, had warned Moggall\u00e1na of Devadatta's intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggall\u00e1na (Vin.ii.185; A.iii.122ff). When R\u00e1hula, the Buddha's son, was ordained, S\u00e1riputta was his preceptor and Moggall\u00e1na his teacher (J.i.161; see SNA.i.304f., where the account is slightly different. There Moggall\u00e1na is spoken of as R\u00e1hula's kammav\u00e1c\u00e1riya.). Moggall\u00e1na seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks\u2019 welfare. Among the verses, attributed to him in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1, are several containing exhortations to his colleagues (Thag.vss.1146-9, 1165f ); some of the colleagues are mentioned by name -  e.g., Tissa, Vaddham\u00e1na and Potthila (Ibid., 1162, 1163, 1174f). Elsewhere (S.i.194f) mention is made of his living at K\u00e1lasil\u00e1, with a company of five", "hundred monks, watching over them and discovering that all were arahants. Vang\u00edsa witnessed this and praised Moggall\u00e1na in verse before the Buddha.</p><p>The love existing between Moggall\u00e1na and S\u00e1riputta was mutual, as was the admiration. S\u00e1riputta's verses in praise of Moggall\u00e1na (Thag.vss.1178 81) are even more eloquent than those of Moggall\u00e1na in praise of S\u00e1riputta (Thag.vss.1176). Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye. E.g., S.ii.275ff.; Moggall\u00e1na elsewhere also (S.ii.273f.) tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers. For another discussion between S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na, see A.ii.154f. </p><p>In the Mah\u00e1gosinga Sutta (M.i.212) we find them staying in the Gosingas\u00e1lavana in the company of Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, Ananda, Revata and Anuruddha, engaged in friendly discussion, referring their conclusions to the Buddha for his opinion. S\u00e1riputta, Moggall\u00e1na, and Anuruddha are again mentioned (S.v.174f., 299) as staying in the Ketak\u00edvana in S\u00e1keta. Among discussions between Anuruddha and Moggall\u00e1na is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of the value of cultivating the four satipatth\u00e1nas (S.v.294f). It seems to have been usual for S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na, in their journeys, to travel together at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were anxious to include them in their invitations. Velukandaki in Dakkhinagiri (A.iii.336; iv.63); and Cittagahapati in Macchik\u00e1sanda (DhA.ii.74f.).</p><p>Moggall\u00e1na died before the Buddha, S\u00e1riputta dying before either. The Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 contains several verses attributed to Moggall\u00e1na regarding S\u00e1riputta's death (vs.1158 61). S\u00e1riputta died on the full moon day of", "Kattika and Moggall\u00e1na two weeks later, on the new moon day (SA.iii.181).  </p><p>According to the Commentaries (J.v.125ff) his death resulted from a plot of the Niganthas. Moggall\u00e1na used to visit various worlds and return with his report that he had discovered that those who followed the Buddha's teaching reached happy worlds, while the followers of the heretics were reborn in woeful conditions. These statements diminished the number of the heretics and they bribed brigands to kill Moggall\u00e1na. They surrounded the Elder's cell in K\u00e1lasil\u00e1, but he, aware of their intentions, escaped through the keyhole. On six successive days this happened; on the seventh, they caught him and beat him, crushing his bones and leaving him for dead. Having recovered consciousness, with a great effort of will, he dragged himself to the Buddha in order to take his leave, and there he died, to the sorrow of the deva worlds. This sad death is said to have been the result of a sin committed by him in a previous birth. Acting on the instigation of his wife, he had taken his blind parents into a forest, where, pretending that they were attacked by thieves, he had beaten them to death. For this deed he suffered in hell for innumerable years, and in his last birth lost his life by violence.</p><p>The account in DhA.iii.65ff. differs in several details. The thieves tried for two months before succeeding in their plot and, in the story of the past, when the blind parents were being beaten, they cried out to the supposed thieves to spare their son. Moggall\u00e1na, very touched by this, did not kill them. Before passing into Nibb\u00e1na, he preached to the Buddha, at his request, and performed many miracles, returning to K\u00e1lasil\u00e1 to die. According to the J\u00e1taka account his cremation was performed with much honour, and the Buddha had the relics collected and a Th\u00fapa erected in Veluvana.</p>", "<p>Moggall\u00e1na's body was of the colour of the blue lotus or the rain cloud (Bu.i.58).

One full moon night he consults his ministers as to how they shall amuse themselves. Al\u00e1ta suggests new conquests; Sun\u00e1ma suggests that they shall seek pleasure in dance, song and music; but Vijaya recommends that they shall visit some samana or brahmin. Angati falls in with the views of Vijaya, and in great state goes to Guna of the Kassapagotta, an ascetic who lives in the park near the city. Guna preaches to him that there is no fruit, good or evil, in the moral life; there is no other world than this, no strength, no courage; all beings are predestined and follow their course like the ship her stern. Al\u00e1ta approves of the views of Guna; he remembers how, in his past life, he was a wicked councillor called Pingala; from there he was born in the family of a general, and now he is a minister. A slave, B\u00edjaka, who is present, can remember his past life and says he was once Bhavasetthi in S\u00e1keta, virtuous and generous, but he is now the son of a prostitute. Even now he gives away half his food to any in need, but see how destitute he is!</p><p>Angati is convinced that Ginda's doctrine is correct, and resolves to find delight only in pleasure. He gives orders that he shall not be disturbed in his palace; Candaka, his minister, is deputed to look after the kingdom. Fourteen days pass in this manner. Then the king's only child, his beloved daughter Ruj\u00e1, comes to him arrayed in splendour, attended by her maidens, and asks for one thousand to be given the next day to mendicants. Angati protests; he will deny his daughter no pleasure or luxury, but has learnt too much to approve of her squandering money on charity or wasting her energy in", "keeping the fasts.</p><p>Ruj\u00e1 is at first amazed, then tells her father that his councillors are fools, they have not taken reckoning of the whole of their past, but remember only one birth or two; they cannot therefore judge. She herself remembers several births; in one she was a smith in R\u00e1jagaha and committed adultery, but that sin remained hidden, like fire covered with ashes, and she was born as a rich merchant's only son in Kosamb\u00ed. There she engaged in good works, but, because of previous deeds, she was born after death in the Roruva-niraya and then as a castrated goat in Bhenn\u00e1kata. In her next birth she was a monkey, and then an ox among the Dasannas; then a hermaphrodite among the Vajjians, and later a nymph in T\u00e1vatimsa. Once more her good deeds have come round, and hereafter she will be born only among gods and men. Seven births hence she will be a male god in T\u00e1vatimsa, and even now the god Java is gathering a garland for her.</p><p>All night she preaches in this way to her father, but he remains unconvinced. The Bodhisatta is a Brahm\u00e1, named N\u00e1rada Kassapa, and, surveying the world, sees Ruj\u00e1 and Angati engaged in conversation. He therefore appears in the guise of an ascetic, and Angati goes out to greet and consult him. The ascetic praises goodness, charity, and generosity, and speaks of other worlds. Angati laughs, and asks for a loan which, he says, he will repay twice over in the next world, as the ascetic seems so convinced that there is one. N\u00e1rada tells him of the horrors of the hell in which Angati will be reborn unless he mends his ways, and mentions to him the names of former kings who attained to happiness through good lives. The king at last sees his error and determines to choose new friends. N\u00e1rada Kassapa reveals his identity and leaves in all majesty.</p><p>The story was related in reference to the conversion of", "<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa')\">Uruvela Kassapa</a>. He came, after his conversion, with the Buddha to Latthivana, and the people wondered if he had really become a follower of the Buddha. He dispelled their doubts by describing the folly of the sacrifices which he had earlier practised, and, laying his head on the Buddha's feet did obeisance. Then he rose seven times into the air, and, after having worshipped the Buddha, sat on one side. The people marvelled at the Buddha's powers of conversion, which, the Buddha said, were not surprising since he possessed them already as a Bodhisatta.</p><p>Angati is identified with Uruvela Kassapa, Al\u00e1ta with Devadatta, Sun\u00e1ma with Bhaddiya, Vijaya with S\u00e1riputta, B\u00edjaka with Moggall\u00e1na, Guna with the Licchavi Sunakkhatta, and Ruj\u00e1 with Ananda.

As a title the word Deva is attributed to any being regarded, in certain respects, as being above the human level. Thus it is used for a king. In a late classification (CNid.307; KhA.123, etc.) there are three kinds of Devil: sammutidev\u00e1 (conventional gods - e.g., kings and princes); visuddhidev\u00e1 (beings who are divine by the purity of their great religious merit - arahants and Buddhas); and uppattidev\u00e1 (beings who are born divine). Under the third category various groups are enumerated, the commonest number being seven: C\u00e1tummah\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1, T\u00e1vatims\u00e1, Y\u00e1m\u00e1, Tusit\u00e1, Nimm\u00e1narat\u00ed, Paranimmitavasavatt\u00ed and Brahmak\u00e1yik\u00e1 (E.g., D.i.216; A.i.210, etc.). The longest list is that of the Majjhima Nik\u00e1ya (i.289; iii.100. The Divy\u00e1vad\u00e1na p.266 contains a list of twenty-two), which contains the names of twenty-five groups. The popular etymology of the word connects it with the root div in the sense of playing, sporting, or amusing oneself, sometimes also of shining: dibbant\u00ed ti dev\u00e1, pa\u00f1cahi k\u00e1magunehi k\u00edlanti, attano v\u00e1 siriy\u00e1 jotant\u00ed ti attho (KhA.123). The word implies possession of splendour and power of moving at will, beauty, goodness and effulgence of body, and, as such, is opposed to the dark powers of mischief and destruction - such as the Asuras, Petas and Nerayikas. The Devas are generally regarded as sharing kinship and continuity of life with humans; all Devas have been men and may again be born among men. They take interest in the doings of men, especially the C\u00e1tummah\u00e1r\u00e1jik\u00e1 and the gods of T\u00e1vatimsa. They come to earth to worship the Buddha and to show reverence to good men. Sakka (q.v.) is usually spoken of as chief of the gods - dev\u00e1nam indo. All Devas are themselves in sams\u00e1ra, needing salvation. They are subject to death, their life-spans varying according to the", "merit of each individual deva. They are born in the full flower of youth and are free from illness till the moment of their death. Devas die from one of the following causes: exhaustion of life, merit or food; failing, through forgetfulness, to eat; and jealousy at the glory of another, which leads to anger. (DhA.l.173. For other particulars regarding devas see the article in the NPD). When a deva is about to die five signs appear on him: his clothes get soiled, flowers worn by him fade, sweat exudes from his armpits, his body loses its colour and he becomes restless on his seat.

The   Dulva (Rockhill, p.13) calls him the son of Amitodana and brother of Ananda.   This is supported by Mtu. (ii.69), which says that after the Buddha's   renunciation, Devadatta tried to tempt Bhaddakacc\u00e1n\u00e1. In one passage in the   Vinaya (ii.189), Devadatta is spoken of as Godhiputta. Does this mean that his   mother's name was Godh\u00ed? The Sanskrit books (e.g., Mtu) give several stories   of his youth which show his malice. When Siddhattha was about to show his   skill in the arts, a white elephant was being brought for him, and Devadatta,   out of envy, killed it. The carcase blocked the city gates till Siddhattha   threw it outside. The P\u00e1li Commentaries (e.g., SA.i.62) say that Devadatta had   the strength of five elephants. On another occasion he quarrelled with   Siddhattha, who protested against his shooting a goose.</p></blockquote><p>When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment and preached to the S\u00e1kiyans, Devadatta was converted together with his friends Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, and their barber, Up\u00e1li, and he sought the Buddha at Anupiy\u00e1 and entered the Order (Vin.ii.182). During the rainy season that followed, Devadatta acquired the power of iddhi possible to those who are yet of the world (puthujja-nika-iddhi) (Vin.ii.183; for particulars see Rockhill, p.85). For some time he seems to have enjoyed great honour in the Order, and in one passage he is mentioned in a list of eleven of the chief Elders of all of whom the Buddha speaks in praise. (Ud.i.5. Again in Vin.ii.189 S\u00e1riputta is mentioned as having gone about", "R\u00e1jagaha singing Devadatta's praises; see also DhA.i.64f). Devadatta was later suspected of evil wishes (E.g., S.ii.156). About eight years before the Buddha's death, Devadatta, eager for gain and favour and jealous of the Buddha's fame, attempted to win over Aj\u00e1tasattu. </p><p> </p><p>The following account is summarised from various passages in the books, chiefly Vin.ii.184ff; iii.171f; 174f; iv.71; DhA.i.112ff; iii.154; A.iii.123, 402; ii.73; iv.160; J.i.113, 142, 185, 490; iv.37, 158; v.333ff; vi.129f., etc.</p><p> </p><p>He assumed the form of a child having a girdle of snakes, and suddenly appeared on Aj\u00e1tasattu's lap, frightening him. He then resumed his own form, and Aj\u00e1tasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and sent him daily five hundred dishes of food. (According to J.i.186, 508, Aj\u00e1tasattu built for him a monastery at Gay\u00e1s\u00edsa and sent him, daily, five hundred pots of three-year-flavoured rice and the choicest dishes. These meals were so tempting that some of the Buddha's followers would go there to eat them and return stealthily). </p><p>This encouraged Devadatta in his schemes, and he conceived the idea of taking the Buddha's place as leader of the Sangha. As soon as this thought occurred to him, his iddhi-power disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>The Koliyan Kakudha, follower of Moggall\u00e1na, reborn as a manomaya-k\u00e1yikadeva, divined Devadatta's plan and informed Moggall\u00e1na. The latter repeated the matter to the Buddha, but the Buddha said it was unnecessary to discuss it as Devadatta would ultimately betray himself.</p><p> </p><p>Sometime later, Devadatta went to the Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to him in view of the Buddha's approaching old age. The Buddha scorned the", "suggestion, saying, \"Not even to S\u00e1riputta or Moggall\u00e1na would I hand over the Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?\" (Vin.ii.188. This incident is referred to in the Abhayar\u00e1jakum\u00e1ra Sutta, M.i.393). Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance. Thereupon, at the Buddha's suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Sangha that in anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, none but Devadatta was to be recognised.</p><p>It was at this time that Devadatta incited Aj\u00e1tasattu to kill his father, Bimbis\u00e1ra, while he himself prepared to kill the Buddha. (The Ap.ii.300f explains that all these plans of Devadatta to harm the Buddha were the result of the Buddha's previous evil deeds).</p><p>Aj\u00e1tasattu agreed, and provided Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha. These were placed on different paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale. But when the Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha's majesty, and his body became stiff. The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing away his weapons, confessed his intended crime. The Buddha thereupon preached to him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path. The other groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after the other. The different groups were led to the Buddha by his iddhi-power, and he preached to them and converted them. The first man returned to Devadatta saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great iddhi-power.</p><p>Devadatta then decided to kill the Buddha himself. One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhak\u00fata, he hurled down on him a great rock. Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby", "arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha's foot, causing the blood to flow. Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from there to J\u00edvaka's Ambavana, where J\u00edvaka attended him. After this event, the monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was impossible for anyone to deprive a Tath\u00e1gata of his life.</p><p> </p><p>Devadatta's next attempt on the Buddha's life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nal\u00e1giri (or Dhanap\u00e1la), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass. The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back. As the elephant advanced he pervaded it with love, and thus completely subdued it.</p><p>This outrage made Devadatta very unpopular, and even Aj\u00e1tasattu was compelled by the force of public opinion to withdraw his patronage from Devadatta, whose gain and honour decreased. (Sp.iv.811. At this time, Kok\u00e1lika was very useful to Devadatta, J. ii.438). Thereupon he decided, with the help of several others, Kok\u00e1lika, Katamoraka-tissa, Khandadeviy\u00e1putta and Samuddadatta, to bring about a schism in the Order. These five went accordingly to the Buddha and asked for the imposition of five rules on all members of the Sangha: </p><ul>  <li>  <p>(1) that monks should dwell all their   lives in the forest, </li>  <li>  <p>(2) that they should accept no   invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging,   </li>  <li>  <p>(3) that they should wear only robes   made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, </li>  <li>  <p>(4) that they should dwell at the foot   of a tree and not under a roof, </li>  <li>  <p>(5) that they should abstain", "completely from fish and flesh. </li></ul><p>The Buddha's reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules - except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season - but he refused to make the rules obligatory. This refusal delighted Devadatta, who went about with his party, declaring that the Buddha was prone to luxury and abundance. He was believed by the foolish, and in spite of the Buddha's warning against the dire sin of causing schism in the Order, Devadatta informed Amanda of his intention of holding an uposatha meeting without the Buddha, and, having persuaded five hundred newly ordained monks from Ves\u00e1li to join him, he went out to Gay\u00e1s\u00edsa. On this occasion he tried to imitate the Buddha, keeping two chief disciples beside him (DhA.i.122). Three suttas, the two Devadatta, and the Mah\u00e1s\u00e1ropama, were preached after this event.</p><p> </p><p>Among the followers of Devadatta were also some nuns, chief of whom was Thullanand\u00e1, who never tired of singing his praises (Vin.iv.66, 335). The mother of Kum\u00e1rakassapa (q.v.), also, first entered the Order under Devadatta, but when he denounced her, following the discovery of her pregnancy, she sought refuge with the Buddha. Some of the S\u00e1kiyans, too, seem to have preferred Devadatta to the Buddha - e.g., Dandap\u00e1ni (MA.i.298). </p><p> </p><p>The Buddha sent S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na to Gay\u00e1s\u00edsa to bring back the deluded ones. Devadatta, believing that they had come to join him, rejoiced, and, in spite of Kok\u00e1lika's warning, welcomed them. That night he preached very late to the monks, and, wishing for rest, asked S\u00e1riputta to address the assembly. S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na preached to such effect that they persuaded the five hundred monks to return with them. Kok\u00e1lika kicked Devadatta on the chest to awaken him and tell him the news. When", "Devadatta discovered what had happened, hot blood came from his mouth, and for nine months he lay grievously ill. (The Vinaya account omits the kicking, but it is mentioned in DhA.i.143 and in J.i.491). </p><p> </p><p>As his end drew near, he wished to see the Buddha, though the latter had declared that it would not be possible in this life. Devadatta, however, started the journey on a litter, but on reaching Jetavana, he stopped the litter on the banks of the pond and stepped out to wash. The earth opened and he was swallowed up in Av\u00edci, where, after suffering for one hundred thousand kappas, he would be reborn as a Pacceka Buddha called Atthissara. (The Saddharmapundarika (chap.xi.) says he will be a Buddha named Devar\u00e1ja). It is said (DhA.i.147; see also Mil.108) that at the moment of being swallowed by the earth, Devadatta uttered a stanza in which he declared that he had no refuge other than the Buddha. It is this last act of Devadatta's which the Buddha had in view when he agreed to ordain Devadatta. (He was one of five people who were swallowed by the earth in the Buddha's time. Mil.101). </p><p> </p><p>The Dhammapada Commentary contains a graphic account of the tortures of Devadatta in Av\u00edci. (DhA.i.147; also PSA.79. His body in bell is one hundred leagues long). In previous births, also, he had been swallowed by the earth, as King Kal\u00e1bu and as Mah\u00e1pat\u00e1pa. When the people heard of Devadatta's death, they held a great festival, as they had done of yore at the death of Pingala, who was an incarnation of Devadatta (DhA.i.126f).</p><p> </p><p>The J\u00e1taka Commentary contains numerous stories showing that Devadatta's enmity towards the Buddha was not confined to this life.

It is said that on the day of his birth all unjust laws disappeared from the law-books, hence his name. For eight thousand years he lived in the household, in three palaces - Araja, Viraja and Sudassana. His chief wife was Vicitol\u00ed and his son Pu\u00f1\u00f1avaddhana. He left the world travelling in his palace, accompanied by all his retinue. For seven days he practised austerities; his wife gave him a meal of milk-rice, and a yavap\u00e1laka, named Sirivaddha, gave grass for his seat; his bodhi-tree was a bimbij\u00e1la-tree. His first sermon was preached at Isipatana. Later he preached to King Sa\u00f1jaya of Tagara, and to Sakka, who was the Bodhisatta. The Buddha's half-brothers, Paduma and Phussadeva, became his chief disciples, and H\u00e1rita was chief of those who practised the dhutangas. The Buddha's personal attendant was Sunetta, his chief women disciples being Khem\u00e1 and Sabba-(Sacca)-dinn\u00e1.

Thus, we are told that B\u00e1var\u00ed had his hermitage in Dakkhin\u00e1patha territory, midway between the kingdoms of Assaka and Alaka (SN., vs.976). Elsewhere the name is coupled with Avanti as Avantidakkhin\u00e1patha and seems to refer, but more vaguely, to the same limited district. Vin.i.195, 196; ii.298. In J.v.133, however, Avanti is spoken of as a part of Dakkhin\u00e1patha (Dakkhin\u00fapathe Avantirattha), but see J.iii.463, where Avantidakkhin\u00e1patha is spoken of.</p><p>The Sutta Nip\u00e1ta Commentary (ii.580) seems to explain Dakkhin\u00e1patha as the road leading to the <b>Dakkhinajanapada</b>, while the Sumangala-Vil\u00e1sin\u00ed (DA.i.265) takes Dakkhin\u00e1patha to be synonymous with Dakkhinajanapada and says that it was the district (janapada) south of the Ganges (Gang\u00e1ya dakkhinato p\u00e1katajanapadam).</p><p>It is clear that, in the earlier literature at any rate, the word did not mean the whole country comprised in the modern word Dekkhan. It is possible that Dakkhin\u00e1patha was originally the name of the road which led southwards - the Aryan settlement at the end of the road, on the banks of the God\u00e1var\u00ed being also called by the same name - and that later the road lent its name to the whole region through which it passed. (For a detailed description see Law: Geog. of Early Buddhism, pp.60ff). In the Petavatthu Commentary (PvA., p.133) the Damila country (Damilavisaya) is included in the Dakkhin\u00e1patha.  </p><p>The Dakkhin\u00e1patha is famous in literature as the birthplace of strong bullocks (DhSA.141; NidA.16; DhA.iii.248, etc.). It held also a large number of ascetics (DA.i.265), and in the \"southern districts\" (Dakkhinesu", "janapadesu) people celebrated a feast called Dharana (A.v.216).

Tissa, maintaining that Pasenadi was ignorant of the arts of war, proceeded to describe in detail what Pasenadi should do if he wished for victory. Some courtiers, overhearing the conversation, reported it to Pasenadi, who, profiting by it, re-entered the battle and captured Aj\u00e1tasattu alive. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he related the Vaddhaki-s\u00fakara J\u00e1taka (q.v.) to show that in the past, too, Tissa had been skilled in the art of warfare (J.ii.403f).

The road from S\u00e1vatthi to R\u00e1jagaha lay through Dakkhin\u00e1giri, and the Buddha traversed it in the course of his periodical tours through Magadha, residing in the Dakkhin\u00e1giri-vih\u00e1ra in Ekan\u00e1l\u00e1 (S.i.172; SA.ii.133; Vin.i.80). It was during one of these tours that he converted Kas\u00ed-Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1ja and Dhammasava (q.v.) and his father. On another of these occasions the Buddha saw the Magadhakhetta, which gave him the idea of designing the robe of a monk to resemble a field (Vin.i.287). Ananda is also said to have travelled through Dakkhin\u00e1giri, gathering a large number of young men into the Order, who, however, do not appear to have been very serious in their intentions, as their behaviour earned for Ananda the censure of Mah\u00e1 Kassapa (S.ii.217f).

Dhammadinna Thera.-Also called Mah\u00e1dhammadinna. An arahant. He resided at Talanga-(Talangatissa-pabbata) (q.v.). He was one of the monks who partook of the meal of sour gruel given by Dutthag\u00e1man\u00ed when in dire distress for want of food. Dhammadinna distributed his share among ten thousand monks in Piyangud\u00edpa (Mhv.xxxii.52). He is also mentioned (MT.606) as having accepted a meal given by S\u00e1liya and his wife when they were blacksmiths in a previous birth. Dhammadinna had a nephew who became an arahant in the tonsure-hall. Dhammadinna read to him the three Pitakas, and he learnt them all on that occasion (VibhA.389). Dhammadinna's teacher was Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ga of Uccatalanka (v.l. Uccav\u00e1lika). Dhammadinna visited him in his old age, knowing that, though he himself thought he had attained arahantship, this was not the case. By a display of iddhi-power, Dhammadinna convinced Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ga of his error and gave him a subject of meditation. Almost immediately after, the Elder became an arahant (VibhA.489; Vsm.634f). Once, while preaching the Apannaka Sutta, at Tissamah\u00e1r\u00e1ma, Dhammadinna pointed his fan downwards, whereupon the earth opened to the depth of Av\u00edci, revealing all that was there. Similarly, he showed all things to the height of the Brahma-world. During his sermon he frightened the audience with the fear of hell and lured them with the bliss of heaven (Vsm.392).</p><p>The Majjhima Commentary records that soon after the ordination of Dhammadinna many monks, on his advice, became arahants. (MA.i.149ff. A variation of what is evidently the same story is found in AA.i.25). Hearing of this, the monks of Tissamah\u00e1r\u00e1ma sent a number of their colleagues to fetch him. He preached to them, and they attained arahantship and remained with him. Three times this happened. On the fourth occasion an aged", "monk was sent. He gave the message of the monks and Dhammadinna started at once to go to them. On the way, at Hankana (v.l. Tangana) and at Cittalapabbata, he persuaded two monks, who thought they were arahants, to display their iddhi-power, and, thereby convinced them of their error; thereupon he gave them topics of meditation. On his arrival at Tissamah\u00e1r\u00e1ma, the monks failed to pay him their respects. He thereupon made the earth tremble and returned to his own vih\u00e1ra. The Saddhammasangaha (p.88f) relates the story of a blind rat-snake who heard Dhammadinna recite the satipatth\u00e1nas and was later born as Tiss\u00e1macca, minister of Dutthag\u00e1mani.</p><hr><p> </p><p>2. Dhammadinna.-An eminent lay-follower of the Buddha. He once came with five hundred up\u00e1sakas to the Buddha at Isipatana and asked him to give them a lesson which might profit them, for, said he, it is difficult for a householder encumbered with a family and the luxuries of household life to comprehend the Buddha's teachings in their fullness. The Buddha answers that they should practise the four limbs of sot\u00e1patti: loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and the cultivation of \u00c1riyan virtues. Dhammadinna answers that they already possess these limbs. The Buddha then expresses his great satisfaction (S.v.406ff).</p><p>The Commentary (SA.iii.223) says that Dhammadinna was one of seven laymen with followings of five hundred - the others being Vis\u00e1kha, Ugga, Citta, Hatthaka \u00c1lavaka and C\u00fala- and Mah\u00e1-An\u00e1thapindika.</p><hr><p> </p><p>3. Dhammadinna. A monk of Tissamah\u00e1-vih\u00e1ra near Tala\u00f1garapabbata. Once, while on pilgrimage to N\u00e1gad\u00edpa with 500 others, he stopped at S\u00e1giri Vih\u00e1ra, and they were looked after by Bahulamassutissa Thera. The next day they went for alms to Punns\u00e1lakotthaka, where a resident entertained them to a meal with hare's flesh. Dhammadinna later asked why Tissa", "Thera did not admonish his follower on the evils of killing, seeing that there was a heap of bones outside the house. Tissa asked Dhammadinna to do so the next day. This was done; the devotee confessed that he had never killed a hare, but in his house there was never any want of hare's flesh, and he did not know why. Dhammadinna, with his divine eye, revealed to him that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had given alms with hare's flesh. Ras.ii.128f.</p><hr><hr>"]}]}}
