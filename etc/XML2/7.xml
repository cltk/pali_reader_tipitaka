<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gaggará (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Gaggará.&lt;/b&gt;-A lotus-pond at Campá.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is several times mentioned as staying on the banks of the pond. On one such occasion Pessa and Kandaraka visited him, and he preached to them the Kandaraka Sutta (M.i.339). Among others who visited him there are mentioned Báhuna (A.v.151), Vajjiyamáhita (A.v.189), and Kassapagotta (Vin.i.312). On one occasion, when the Buddha was staying there, Sáriputta approached him with a large number of the inhabitants of Campà and asked him questions concerning the efficacy of giving alms (A.iv.59ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another such occasion Sáriputta assembled the monks and preached to them the Dasuttara Sutta (D.iii.272ff). It was on the banks of the Gaggará that the Buddha preached the Karandava Sutta (q.v.) on the necessity of getting rid of evil-minded members of the Sangha lest they should corrupt the whole Order (A.iv.168f), and the pond-bank was also the scene of the preaching of the well-known Sonadanda Sutta (D.i.111f). Once, when the Buddha was at this spot with a large number of monks and lay-followers, Vangísa came up to him and praised him in a song, pointing out how the Buddha outshone them all (S.i.195; Thag.v.1252; ThagA.ii.210).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pond was called Gaggará because it owed its origin to a queen of that name. On its bank was a Campaka-grove where the Buddha stayed during his visits (MA.ii.565; DA.i.279f). Nearby was a monastery of titthiyas. (See A.v.189). The pond, together with that at Jetavana, is given as an example of a very beautiful lotus pond (E g., AA.i.264). Monks found it a convenient spot for meditation (SNA.i.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gandhabbá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of semi-divine beings who inhabit the Cátumma-hárájika-realm and are the lowest among the devas (D.ii.212). They are generally classed together with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura')"&gt;Asuras&lt;/a&gt; and the Nágas (E.g., A.iv.200, 204, 207). Beings are born among them as a result of having practised the lowest form of síla (D.ii.212, 271).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a disgrace for a monk to be born in the Gandhabba-world (D.ii.221, 251, 273f). The Gandhabbas are regarded as the heavenly musicians, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancasikha')"&gt;Pañcasikha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suriyavaccasaa')"&gt;Suriyavaccasá&lt;/a&gt; and her father &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/timbaru')"&gt;Timbarú&lt;/a&gt; are among their number (D.ii.264).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wait on such devas as Sakka, and the males among them form the masculine counterpart of the acchará, the nymphs. Their king is &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhatarattha')"&gt;Dhatarattha&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of the eastern quarter (D.ii.257). Other chieftains are also mentioned (D.ii.258): Panáda, Opamañña, Sakka's charioteer Mátalí, Cittasena, Nala and Janesabha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gandhabbas are sometimes described as vihangamá (going through the air) (A.ii.39; AA.ii.506). In the Átánátiya Sutta (D.iii.203, 204) the Gandhabbas are mentioned among those likely to trouble monks and nuns in their meditations in solitude. The Buddha says that beings are born among the Gandhabakáyiká devá because they wish to be so; they are described as dwelling in the fragrance of root-wood, of bark and sap, and in that of flowers and scents (S.iii.250f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often stated that the Gandhabbas preside over conception; this is due to an erroneous translation of the word gandhabba in passages (E.g., M.i.157, 265f) dealing </data>
<data>with the circumstances necessary for conception (mátápitaro ca sannipatitá honti, mátá ca utuní hoti, gandhabbo ca paccupatthito hoti).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.481f ) explain that here gandhabba means tatrúpakasatta - tasmim okáse nibbattanako satto - meaning a being fit and ready to be born to the parents concerned. The Tíká says that the word stands for gantabba. See also Gandhabbarájá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Girimánanda Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of King Bimbisára's chaplain and, having seen the might of the Buddha when the Buddha entered Rájagaha, joined the Order. He lived in a village studying, but one day, when he came to Rájagaha to visit the Buddha, the king asked him to remain, promising to look after him. The king, however, forgot his promise, and Girimánanda had to live in the open. The gods, fearing to wet him, stopped rain from falling. The king, observing the drought and discovering the reason for it, built him a hermitage wherein the Thera put forth effort and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a householder, and when his wife and children died he fled into the forest in grief. There the Buddha consoled him, and he offered flowers to the Buddha and sang his praises (Thag.vv.325-9; ThagA.i.409ff; Ap.i.330f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Giri Sutta was preached in reference to Girimánanda, when he lay grievously ill.

Ádásamukha became king at the age of seven, having successfully solved the problems set him by his courtiers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janasandha had a servant named Gámani-Canda who, being old, retired when Ádásamukha came to the throne. But various mishaps befell Gámani-Canda, and he was charged on various counts by different people. As he was being brought to the king to receive punishment, he was asked by several persons to convey messages to the king, and to find out from him solutions for their troubles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king listened to the charges brought against Gámani and to his explanation of them. Convinced of Gámani's innocence, he passed sentences which ultimately brought gain to Gámani. The king then proceeded to solve the problems contained in the messages brought by Gámani. He gave to Gámani the village in which he lived, free from all taxes, and there Gámani lived happily to the end of his days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told by the Buddha to certain monks who had been discussing his wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gámani-Canda is identified with Ananda. In the story he is referred to also as Gámani, Canda-Gámani and Canda. J.ii.297-310.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gavampati (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Gavampati Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant. He was a son of a setthi in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the four lay companions of the Thera &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa')"&gt;Yasa&lt;/a&gt;, who, when they heard of Yasa's renunciation, imitated him and won arahant-ship. Later, Gavampati lived in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana_vana')"&gt;Añjanavana&lt;/a&gt; at Sáketa. One day, when the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; visited the Añjanavana, some of the monks accompanying him slept on the sandbanks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhu')"&gt;Sarabhú&lt;/a&gt;. The river rose in the night and there was great dismay. The Buddha sent Gavampati to stem the flood, which he did by his iddhi-power. The water stopped afar off, looking like a mountain peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sikhii')"&gt;Sikhí&lt;/a&gt; Buddha he was a huntsman and seeing the Buddha offered him flowers. Later he built a parasol and a railing for the thúpa of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/konaagamana')"&gt;Konágamana&lt;/a&gt;. In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddha he was a rich house holder possessed of many cattle. One day he saw an arahant eating his meal in the sun for lack of shade, and built for him a shelter and planted in front of it a sirísa-tree. As a result he was born in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Cátummahárájika&lt;/a&gt; world, and his palace was known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/serissaka')"&gt;Serissaka&lt;/a&gt;. (Vin.i.18f.; Thag.v.38; ThagA.i.103f; VvA.331f; DA.iii.814 gives a slightly different version of the origin of the Serissaka-vimána).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavampati was the teacher of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanaga')"&gt;Mahánága&lt;/a&gt;, </data>
<data>son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/m1_mag')"&gt;Madhu-Vásettha&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.443). It is said that the Serissaka-vimána, occupied by Gavampati, remained in the Cátummahárajika world even after he had left it. (D.ii.356f; DA.iii.814 says he went there because he found the &quot;climate&quot; (utu) more agreeable. SNA.i.347 says it was because he, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pindola')"&gt;Pindola-bháradvája&lt;/a&gt;, loved his old haunts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There Gavampati often spent his siesta and held conversations with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/payasi')"&gt;Páyási&lt;/a&gt;, who sent through him a message to the inhabitants of the earth, that they should profit by the example of him (Páyási) and discriminate in the bestowal of their gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dulvá mentions (Rockhill, p.149f) that after the Buddha's death, when Mahá Kassapa wished to hold a Convocation of the chief monks, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punna')"&gt;Punna&lt;/a&gt; was sent as a special messenger to summon Gavampati, who was then in the Serissaka-vimána. But Gavampati did not attend, his death being imminent. Instead he sent his bowl and three robes as a gift to the Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately afterwards he died, and Punna carried out his funeral rites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavampati is evidently identical with Girinelapújaka of the Apadána (ii.457). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Gavampati Sutta below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gavampati.-&lt;/b&gt;The Sásanavamsa (p.36f) speaks of a Thera by this name, at whose request the Buddha went to Sudhammapura in the Rámañña country to establish his religion. In a previous life Gavampati was born of an egg laid by a Nága maiden who had relations with a vijjá-dhara. The egg was hatched and a child was born, but it died at the age of ten and was reborn at Mithilá as Gavampati. He joined the Order at the age of seven and </data>
<data>became an arahant. Later he visited Sudhamma-pura to preach to his mother, and there King Síha asked him to invite the Buddha to his country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gavampati Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Preached by Gavampati at Sahajáti in the Ceti country. A number of the senior monks were talking of dukkha, and Gavampati tells them that he knows from the Buddha's own self that whosoever understands dukkha knows all its aspects - its nature, its arising, its cessation and the path thereto.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Godha or Mahánáma Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahánáma visits Godha the Sákiyan at Kapilavatthu and asks him what qualities, possessed by a  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;, will secure for him ultimate enlightenment. There are three, answers Godha-unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. When Godha, in his turn, asks the same question of Mahánáma, the latter answers that there are four, and adds the possession of Áriyan virtues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two seek the Buddha to ask his opinion. Mahánáma declares to the Buddha that he would accept the Buddha's decision in face of the opinion of everyone else in the universe. In answer to a question of the Buddha, Godha answers that of a person who holds such a view he has nothing but good to say, the conclusion evidently being that he accepts Mahánáma's opinion in preference to his own.

The Bodhisatta, not knowing this, went to work as usual on the fast day, but, on discovering that no one else was working and the reason for their abstention, he refused to take any food, and as a result of his fasting died in the night. He was reborn as son of the king of Benares, and later became king under the name of Udaya. On meeting Addhamásaka (q.v.), Udaya shared the kingdom with him, but one day Addhamásaka, discovering that he harboured a desire to kill Udaya, renounced his kingdom and became an ascetic. When Udaya heard of this he uttered a stanza, referring to his own past life, but no one could understand the meaning of it. The queen, anxious to learn the meaning, told the king's barber Gangamála how he might win the king's favour, and when the king offered him a boon, Gangamála chose to have the stanza explained to him. When he learnt how Udaya had won a kingdom as a result of having kept the fast for half a day, Gangamála renounced the world and, developing asceticism, became a Pacceka Buddha. Later he visited King Udaya and preached to him and his retinue, addressing the king by name. The queen-mother took offence at this and abused Gangamála, but the king begged him to forgive her. Gangamála returned to Gandhamádana, though urged by Udaya to stay in the royal park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was Addhamásaka, and Ráhulamátá was the queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related by the Buddha to some lay-followers to en-courage them in their observance of the Uposatha (J.iii.444ff). Gangamála is mentioned as an example of a man who realised the evils of tanhá and renounced desire. E.g., J.iv.174.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

Moggallána says that the brahmanical training is a thoroughly graduated system (anupub-basikkhá anupubbakiriyá). Can the Buddha say the same of his teaching? The Buddha says he can and proceeds to explain. It is true that not all the Buddha's disciples attain to the goal, but the fault is theirs; the Buddha accepts no responsibility, he only indicates the way.

One day, Mahá Kaccána and seven others visited the village, and she sold her hair for eight kahápanas, that she might provide the visitors with a meal. It is said that she recovered her hair immediately on seeing Mahá Kaccána.

All his attempts having failed, he promises a potter one thousand pieces if he will kill the boy. Ghosita is sent to the potter with a message; on the way he meets his foster-brother, and gives him the message, promising to win for him a game of marbles. The foster-brother goes to the potter and is killed. The Treasurer then sends Ghosaka to the superintendent of his hundred villages with a letter ordering that he be killed. The letter is fastened to the boy's garment. On the way he stops for a meal at the house of a country-treasurer whose beautiful daughter falls in love with him. Discovering the letter, she substitutes another to the effect that Ghosaka should be married to her with great festivity and that a two-storied house should be built for them. The superintendent carries out these orders and the Treasurer falls ill on receiving the news. He is visited on his death-bed by Ghosaka and his wife, and while trying with his dying breath to say &quot;I do not give him my wealth,&quot; by a slip of the tongue he says &quot;I do.&quot; Ghosaka becomes a very pious man and is made the Treasurer of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;.

On the way he cast off the child on account of its being too heavy, but rescued it later in answer to his wife's importunities. It was as a result of that act that he was cast away in this birth. Later he was born as a dog and then as Ghosakadevaputta (DhA.i.169ff; PsA.504ff) (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghosaka had two colleagues in Kosambí, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kukkuta')"&gt;Kukkuta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pavarika')"&gt;Paváriya&lt;/a&gt;. For a number of years they entertained five hundred ascetics from Himavá, during the rainy season, until one year the ascetics, hearing from a tree-sprite, who had been one of Anáthapindika's labourers, of the arising of the Buddha, informed Ghosaka and his friends of their determination to see the Buddha at Sávatthi. The ascetics went on ahead, followed by Ghosaka and the others, bearing all kinds of gifts. They all heard the Buddha preach, became &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápannas&lt;/a&gt;, and invited the Buddha to Kosambí.

Udena describes to him the four types of individuals - those who torture themselves, those who torture others, those who torture both and those who torture neither, the last being those who live beyond appetites, consummate, unfevered and blissful. They want none of the things after which men hanker, but discarding them all go forth to homelessness. Ghotamukha admits that such are Righteous Recluses.

The Bodhisatta, born as the divinity of a gandatindu-tree, becoming aware of this, appears in the king's bedchamber and urges him to give up his evil ways and find out for himself the condition of his subjects. The king, taking this advice, travels about in disguise with his chaplain. Everywhere he finds men, women and even the beasts cursing his very name. He returns to the capital and devotes himself to good works (J.v.98ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introductory story is given in the Rájováda Játaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Garudá, Garulá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of mythical birds generally mentioned in company with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga')"&gt;Nágas&lt;/a&gt; (E.g., J.iv.181, 202). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They live in Simbali-groves (E.g., J.i.202) and are usually huge in size, sometimes one hundred and fifty leagues from wing to wing (J.iii.397). The flapping of their wings can raise a storm, known as the Garuda-wind (J.v.77). This wind can plunge a whole city in darkness and cause houses to fall through its violence (J.iii.188). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Garula has strength great enough to carry off a whole banyan tree, tearing it up from its roots (J.vi.177). The Garulas are the eternal enemies of the Nágas (J.ii.13; iii.103) and live in places, such as the Seruma Island (J.iii.187), where Nágas are to be found. The greatest happiness of the Nágas is to be free from the attacks of the Garulas (J.iv.463). A Garula's plumage is so thick that a man - e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/n2_ny')"&gt;Natakuvera&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.91) - could hide in it, unnoticed by the bird. Sometimes Garulas assume human form; two Garula kings are said to have played dice with kings of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and to have fallen in love with their queens, whom they took to the Garula city - one of the queens being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sussondii_jat_360')"&gt;Sussondí&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.187) and the other &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaakaatii_jat_327')"&gt;Kákátí&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.91). In each case the queen, being found unfaithful to her Garula lover, was returned to her husband. The Garulas know the Álambáyana spell, which no Nága can resist (J.vi.178, 184). It is said that in olden days the Garulas did not know how to seize Nágas effectively; they caught them by the bead, and the Nágas who had swallowed big stones were too heavy to be lifted from the </data>
<data>ground; consequently the Garulas died of exhaustion in trying to carry them. Later the Garulas learnt this secret through the treachery of the ascetic &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/karambiya')"&gt;Karambiya&lt;/a&gt;, as related in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pandara_jat_518')"&gt;Pandara Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.175f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garulas are mentioned as sometimes leading virtuous lives, keeping the fast and observing the precepts. One such was the Garula king mentioned in the Pandara Játaka, and another, the son of Vináta, who visited the park of Dhanañjaya Koravya and gave a golden garland as present after hearing Vidhurapandita preach (J.vi.261f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Garula's body was evidently considered to be specially formed for quick flight, for the ancient proto-type of the aeroplane was based on the Garula (DhA.iii.135). One of the five guards appointed by Sakka to protect Távatimsa from the Asuras was formed of Garulas (J.i.204). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.187) and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.400) were both, on different occasions, born as Garula kings. The Simbalí is the special tree of the Garula-world (Vsm.i.206). The Garula is often represented in art as a winged Man. (See Fergusson: Tree and Serpent Worship, pl.xxvi.1; xxviii.1. etc.; also Gründwedel: Buddhistische Kunst, pp.47-50). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Garulas are sometimes called &lt;b&gt;Supannas&lt;/b&gt; (Suvannas).

To show his gratitude the Lion took the Jackal and his wife home with him, and the two animals and their wives lived together, the Lion and the Jackal going out together hunting. Later on, the Lioness grew jealous of the she-Jackal and tried to frighten her away in the absence of their husbands. When the Lion heard of this, he told his wife how the Jackal had befriended him in his hour of danger, and thenceforth they all lived happily together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jackal is identified with Ananda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a gift made by Ananda. Once, when he had been preaching to the women of Pasenadi's palace, they gave him five hundred new garments which the king had just presented to them. The king hearing of this was at first annoyed, but on questioning Ananda he was satisfied that no gift presented to the Sangha could ever be wasted. Delighted with this discovery, the king himself gave five hundred robes to Ananda, all of which Ananda presented to a young monk who was very useful and helpful to him. The monk, in his turn, distributed them among his fellow celibates, who wondered why Ananda should have singled out one monk as the recipient of his gifts. When the matter was related to the Buddha, he assured the monks that the gift was offered to the monk by Ananda only in return for numerous services (J.ii.23ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka is also called Síha Játaka, and probably also the Sigála Játaka. E.g., in J.ii.314.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A monk asks the Buddha whether there is any body or anything at all that is permanent and stable. The Buddha takes a pellet of cow dung in his hand and tells him that the personality in any one span of life (attabháva) even as small as that pellet is unstable. The Buddha then tells the monk of the great luxuries he had enjoyed as king (Mahá-Sudassana) of Kusávati, and of how they all perished (S.iii.143f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta was preached by Mahinda at the Nandana grove, on the sixth day after his arrival in Ceylon.

This journey is called Gangárohana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta mentioned is probably, therefore, the Ratana Sutta (q.v.) which the Buddha preached at Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gotama&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last of the twenty-five Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No comprehensive account of Gotama Buddha is as yet possible. The details given in this article are those generally accepted by orthodox Theravádins and contained in their books, chiefly the Páli Commentaries, more especially the Nidánakathá of the Játaka and the Buddhavamsa Commentary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biographical details are also found in the Mahá Vagga and the Culla Vagga of the Vinaya Pitaka, the Buddhavamsa and in various scattered passages of the Nikayas of the Sutta Pitaka. References to these are given where considered useful. Controversy exists with regard to many of the matters mentioned; for discussion of the varying views regarding these, reference should be made to the works of Oldenberg, Rhys Davids (both Professor and Mrs. Rhys Davids), Kern, E. J. Thomas and other scholars. Further particulars of persons and places mentioned can be obtained by reference to the articles under the respective names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a Sákiyan (the Sákiyans were evidently subjects of the Kosala king; the Buddha calls himself a Kosalan, M.ii.124), son of Suddhodana (all Páli Commentaries and Sanskrit works represent the Buddha as the son of a king, descendant of a long line of famous ancestors), chief ruler of Kapilavatthu, and of Mahá Máyá, Suddhodana's chief consort, and he belonged to the Gotama-gotta. Before his conception he was in the Tusita heaven, waiting for the due time for his birth in his last existence. Then, having made the &quot;five investigations&quot; (pañcavilolcanáni) (see Buddha), he took leave of his companions and descended to earth. (According to the Lalitavistara he appointed the Bodhisatta Maitreya as king of Tusita in his place). Many </data>
<data>wondrous and marvellous events attended his conception and birth. (Given in the Acchariyabbhutadhamma Sutta, M.iii.118f; also D.ii.12f. A more detailed account is found in J.i.47ff; both the Lai. and the Mtu.ii.14ff differ as to the details given here of the conception and the birth). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conception takes place on the full-moon day of Ásálha, with the moon in Uttarásálha, and Maya has no relations with her husband. She has a marvellous dream in which the Bodhisatta, as a white elephant, enters her womb through her side. When the dream is mentioned to the brahmins, they foretell the birth of a son who will be either a universal monarch or a Buddha. An earthquake takes place and thirty-two signs appear, presaging the birth of a great being. The first of these signs is a boundless, great light, flooding every corner of the ten thousand worlds; everyone beholds its glory, even the fires in all hells being extinguished. Ten months after the conception, in the month of Visákha, Máyá wishes to visit her parents in Devadaha. On the way thither from Kapilavatthu she passes the beautiful Lumbini grove, in which she desires to wander; she goes to a great sála-tree and seizes a branch in her hand; labour pains start immediately, and, when the courtiers retire, having drawn a curtain round her, even while standing, she is delivered of the child. It is the day of the full moon of Visákha; four Mahábrahmas receive the babe in a golden net, and streams of water descend from the sky to wash him. The boy stands on the earth, takes seven steps north-wards and utters his lion-roar, &quot;I am the chief in the world.&quot; On the same day seven other beings were born: the Bodhi-tree, Ráhula's mother (Ráhulamátá, his future wife), the four Treasure-Troves (described at DA.i.284), his elephant, his horse Kanthaka, his charioteer Channa, and Káludáyí. The babe is escorted back to Kapilavatthu </data>
<data>on the day of his birth and his mother dies seven days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The isi Asita (or Káladevala), meditating in the Himálaya, learns from the Távatimsa gods of the birth of the Buddha, visits Suddhodana the same day and sees the boy, whom they both worship. Asita weeps for sorrow that he will not live to see the boy's Buddhahood, but he instructs his nephew Nálaka (v.l. Naradatta) to prepare himself for that great day. On the fifth day after the birth is the ceremony of name-giving. One hundred and eight brahmins are invited to the festival at the palace; eight of them - Ráma, Dhaja, Lakkhana, Manti, Kondañña, Bhoja, Suyáma and Sudatta - are interpreters of bodily marks, and all except Kondañña prophesy two possibilities for the boy; but Kondañña, the youngest, says, quite decisively, that he will be a Buddha. The name given to the boy at this ceremony is not actually mentioned, but from other passages it is inferred that it was Siddhattha (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other incidents recounted of the Buddha's boyhood is that of his attaining the first jhána under a jambu-tree. One day he is taken to the state ploughing of the king where Suddhodana himself, with his golden plough, ploughs with the farmers. The nurses, attracted by the festivities, leave the child under a jambu-tree. They return to find him seated, cross-legged, in a trance, the shadow of the tree remaining still, in order to protect him. The king is informed and, for the second time, does reverence to his son. J.i.57f; MA.i.466f; the incident is alluded to in the Mahá Saccaka Sutta (M.i.246); the corresponding incident recounted in Mtu. (ii.45f.) takes place in a park, and the, details differ completely. The Lai. has two versions, one in prose and one in verse and both resemble the Mtu.; but in these the Buddha is represented as being much older. The Divy (391) and the Tibetan </data>
<data>versions (e.g., Rockhill, p.22) put the incident very much later in the Buddha's life. Other incidents are given in Lai. and Mtu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta is reported to have lived in the household for twenty-nine years a life of great luxury and excessive ease, surrounded by all imaginable comforts. He owns three palaces - Ramma, Suramma and Subha - for the three seasons. Mention is made of his luxurious life in A.i.145; also in M.i.504; further details are given in AA.i.378f.; J.i.58. See also Mtu.ii.115; cf. Vin.i.15; D.ii.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Bodhisatta is sixteen years old, Suddhodana sends messengers to the Sákyans asking that his son be allowed to seek a wife from among their daughters; but the Sákyans are reluctant to send them, for, they say, though the young man is hand-some, he knows no art; how, then, can he support a wife? When this is reported to the prince, he summons an assembly of the Sákyans and performs various feats, chief of these being twelve feats with a bow which needs the strength of one thousand men. (The feats with the bow are described in the Sarabhanga Játaka, J.v.129f ). The Sákyans are so impressed that each sends him a daughter, the total number so sent being forty thousand. The Bodhisatta appoints as his chief wife the daughter of Suppabuddha, who, later, comes to be called Ráhulamátá. She is known under various names: Bhaddakaccá (or Kaccáná), Yasodhará. Bimbá, Bimbasundarí and Gopá. For a discussion see Ráhulamátá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the generally accepted account, Gotama is twenty-nine when the incidents occur which lead to final renunciation. Following the prophecy of the eight brahmins, his father had taken every precaution that his son should see no sign of old age, sickness or death. But the gods decide that the time is come for the Enlightenment, and instil into </data>
<data>Gotama's heart a desire to go into the park. On the way, the gods put before him a man showing signs of extreme age, and the Bodhisatta returns, filled with desire for renunciation. The king, learning this, surrounds him with even greater attractions, but on two other days Gotama goes to the park and the gods put before him a sick man and a corpse. (According to some accounts, e.g. that of the Díghabhánakas, the four omens were all seen on the same day, J.i.59)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the full-moon day of Ásálha, the day appointed for the Great Renunciation, Gotama sees a monk and hears from his charioteer praise of the ascetic life. Feeling very happy, he goes to the park to enjoy himself. Sakka sends Vissakamma himself to bathe and adorn him, and as Gotama returns to the city in all his majesty, he receives news of the birth of his son. Foreseeing in this news a bond, he decides to call the babe Ráhula (q.v.). Kisá Gotamí (q.v.) sees Gotama on the way to the palace and, filled with longing for him, sings to him a song containing the word nibbuta. The significance of the word (=extinguished, at peace) thrills him, and he sends to Kisá his priceless gold necklace which she, however, accepts as a token of love. Gotama enters the palace and sleeps. He wakes in the middle of the night to find his female musicians sleeping in attitudes which fill him with disgust and with loathing for the worldly life, and he decides to leave it. (In some versions the Renunciation takes place seven days after the birth of Ráhula, J.i.62). He orders Channa to saddle Kanthaka, and enters his wife's room for a last look at her and their son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He leaves the city on his horse Kanthaka, with Channa clinging to its tail. The devas muffle the sound of the horse's hoofs and of his neighing and open the city gates for Gotama to pass. Mára </data>
<data>appears before Gotama and seeks to stay him with a promise that he shall be universal monarch within seven days. On his offer being refused, Mára threatens to shadow him always. Outside the city, at the spot where later was erected the Kanthakanivattana-cetiya, Gotama turns his horse round to take a last look at Kapilavatthu. It is said that the earth actually turned, to make it easy for him to do so. Then, accompanied by the gods, he rides thirty leagues through three kingdoms - those of the Sákyans, the Koliyans and the Mallas - and his horse crosses the river Anomá in one leap. On the other side, he gives all his ornaments to Channa, and with his sword cuts off hair and beard, throwing them up into the air, where Sakka takes them and enshrines them in the Cúlámani-cetiya in Távatimsa. The Brahmá Ghatikára offers Gotama the eight requisites of a monk, which he accepts and adopts. He then sends Channa and Kanthaka back to his father, but Kanthaka, broken-hearted, dies on the spot and is reborn as Kanthaka-devaputta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account given here is taken mainly from the Nidánakathá (J.i.59ff) and evidently embodies later tradition; cp. D.ii.21ff. From passages found in the Pitakas (e.g., A.i.145; M.i.163, 240; M.ii.212f.) it would appear that the events leading up to the Renunciation were not so dramatic as given here, the process being more gradual. I do not, however, agree with Thomas (op. cit., 58) that, according to these accounts, the Bodhisatta left the world when &quot;quite a boy.&quot; I think the word dahara is used merely to indicate &quot;the prime of youth,&quot; and not necessarily &quot;boyhood.&quot; The description of the Renunciation in the Lal. is very much more elaborate and adds numerous incidents, no account of which is found in the Páli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Anomá the Bodhisatta goes to the </data>
<data>mango-grove of Anupiya, and after spending seven days there walks to Rájagaha (a distance of thirty leagues) in one day, and there starts his alms rounds. Bimbisára's men, noticing him, report the matter to the king, who sends messengers to enquire who this ascetic is. The men follow Gotama to the foot of the Pandavapabbata, where he eats his meal, and they then go and report to the king. Bimbisára visits Gotama, and, pleased with his hearing, offers him the sovereignty. On learning the nature of Gotama's quest, he wins from him a promise to visit Rájagaha first after the Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This incident is also mentioned in the Pabbajjá Sutta (SN.vv.405-24), but there it is the king who first sees Gotama. It is significant that, when asked his identity, Gotama does not say he is a king's son. The Pali version of tile sutta contains nothing of Gotama's promise to visit Rájagaha, but the Mtu. version (ii.198-200), which places the visit later, has two verses, one of which contains the request and the other the acceptance; and the SNA. (ii.385f.), too, mentions the promise and tells that Bimbisára was informed of the prophecy concerning Gotama. There is another version of the Mtu. (ii.117-20) which says that Gotama went straight to Vaisáli after leaving home, joining Álára, and later visited Uddaka at Rájagaha. Here no mention is made of Bimbisára. We are told in the Mhv. (ii.25ff) that Bimbisára and Gotama (Siddhattha) had been playmates, Bimbisára being the younger by five years. Bimbisára's father (Bhátí) and Suddhodana were friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journeying from Rájagaha, Gotama in due course becomes a disciple of Álára-Káláma. Having learnt and practised all that Álára has to teach, he finds it unsatisfying and joins Uddaka-Rámaputta; but Uddaka's doctrine leaves him still unconvinced and he abandons it. He then goes </data>
<data>to Senánígáma in Uruvelá and there, during six years, practises all manner of severe austerities, such as no man had previously undertaken. Once he falls fainting and a deva informs Suddhodana that Gotama is dead. But Suddhodana, relying on the prophecy of Káladevala, refuses to believe the news. Gotama's mother, now born as a devaputta in Távatimsa, comes to him to encourage him. At Uruvelá, the Pañcavaggiya monks are his companions, but now, having realised the folly of extreme asceticism, he decides to abandon it, and starts again to take normal food; thereupon the Pañcavaggiyas, disappointed, leave him and go to Isipatana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;J.i.66f. The Therígáthá Commentary   (p.2) mentions another teacher of Gotama, named Bhaggava, whom Gotama visited   before Álára. Lal. (330 [264]) contains a very elaborate account of Gotama's   visits to teachers; he goes first to two brahmin women, Sákí and Padmá, then   to Raivata and Rajaka, son of Trimandika, and finally (as far as this chapter   is concerned) to Álára at Vaisáli. A poem containing an account of the meeting   of Gotama with Bimbisára is inserted into this account. The next chapter tells   of Uddaka. An account of Gotama's visits to teachers and of the details of his   austerities is also given in the Mahá Saccaka Sutta, already referred to   (M.i.240ff); the Mahá Síhanáda Sutta (M.i.77ff) contains a long and detailed   account of his extreme asceticisms. See also M.i.163ff; ii.93f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama's desire for normal food is satisfied by an offering brought by Sujátá to the Ajapála banyan tree under which he is seated. She had made a vow to the tree, and her wish having been granted, she takes her slave-girl, Punná, and goes to the tree prepared to fulfil her promise. They take Gotama to be the Tree-god, come in person to </data>
<data>accept her offering of milk-rice; the offering is made in a golden bowl and he takes it joyfully. Five dreams he had the night before convince Gotama that he will that day become the Buddha. (The dreams are, recounted in A.iii.240 and in Mtu.ii.136f). It is the full-moon day of Visákha; he bathes at Suppatittha in the Nerañjará, eats the food and launches the bowl up stream, where it sinks to the abode of the Nága king, Kála (Mahákála).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama spends the rest of the day in a sála-grove and, in the evening, goes to the foot of the Bodhi-tree, accompanied by various divinities; there the grass-cutter Sotthiya gives him eight handfuls of grass; these, after investigation, Gotama spreads on the eastern side of the tree, where it becomes a seat fourteen hands long, on which he sits cross-legged, determined not to rise before attaining Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.i.69. The Pitakas know nothing of Sujátá's offering or of Sotthiya's gift. Lal. (334-7 [267-70]) mentions ten girls in all who provide him with food during his austerities. Divy (392) mentions two, Nandá and Nandabalá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mára, lord of the world of passion, is determined to prevent this fulfilment, and attacks Gotama with all the strength at his command. His army extends twelve leagues to the front, right, and left of him, to the end of the Cakkavála behind him, and nine leagues into the sky above him. Mára himself carries numerous weapons and rides the elephant Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height. At the sight of him all the divinities gathered at the Bodhi-tree to do honour to Gotama - the great Brahmá, Sakka, the Nága-king Mahákála - disappear in a flash, and Gotama is left alone with the ten páramí, long practised by him, as his sole protection. All Mára's attempts to frighten him by means of storms and terrifying apparitions fail, and, in the </data>
<data>end, Mára hurls at him the Cakkávudha. It remains as a canopy poised over Gotama. The very earth bears witness to Gotama's fitness to be the Enlightened One, and Girimekhala kneels before him. Mára is vanquished and flees headlong with his vast army. The various divinities who had fled at the approach of Mára now return to Gotama and exult in his triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole story of the contest with Mára is, obviously, a mythological development. It is significant that in the Majjhima passages referred to earlier there is no mention of Mára, of a temptation, or even of a Bodhi-tree; but see D.ii.4 and Thomas (op. cit., n.1). According to the Kálingabodhi Játaka, which, very probably, embodies an old tradition, the bodhi-tree was worshipped even in the Buddha's life-time. The Mára legend is, however, to be found in the Canonical Padhána Sutta of the Sutta Nipáta. This perhaps contains the first suggestion of the legend. For a discussion see Mára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama spends that night in deep meditation. In the first watch he gains remembrance of his former existences; in the middle watch he attains the divine eye (dibbacakkhu); in the last watch he revolves in his mind the Chain of Causation (paticcasamuppáda). As he masters this, the earth trembles and, with the dawn, comes Enlightenment. He is now the supreme Buddha, and he breaks forth into a paean of joy (udána).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is great doubt as to which were these Udána verses. The Nidánakathá and the Commentaries generally quote two verses (153, 154) included in the Dhammapada collection (anekajáti samsáram, etc.). The Vinaya (i.2) quotes three different verses (as does also DhsA.17), and says that one verse was repeated at the end of each watch, all the watches being occupied with meditation on the paticcasamuppáda. Mtu. (ii.286) gives a completely different Udána, and in another place (ii.416) mentions a different </data>
<data>verse as the first Udána. The Tibetan Vinaya is, again, quite different (Rockhill, p.33). For a discussion see Thomas, op. cit., 75ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first week the Buddha remains under the Bodhi-tree, meditating on the Paticcasamuppáda; the second week he spends at the Ajapálanigrodha, where the &quot;Huhuhka&quot; Brahmin accosts him (Mara now comes again and asks the Buddha to die at once; D.ii.112) and where Mara's daughters, Tanhá, Aratí and Rágá, appear before the Buddha and make a last attempt to shake his resolution (J.i.78; S.i.124; Lal.490 (378)); the third week he spends under the hood of the nága-king Mucalinda (Vin.i.3); the fourth week is spent in meditation under the Rájáyatana tree*; at the end of this period takes place the conversion of Tapussa and Bhallika. They take refuge in the Buddha and the Dhamma, though the Buddha does not give them any instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*This is the Vinaya account   (Vin.i.1ff); but the Játaka (i.77ff, extends this period to seven weeks, the   additional weeks being inserted between the first and second. The Buddha   spends one week each at the Animisa-cetiya, the Ratanacankama and the   Ratanaghara, and this last is where he thinks out the Abhidhamma Pitaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubts now assail the Buddha as to whether he shall proclaim to the world his doctrine, so recondite, so hard to understand. The Brahma Sahampati (according to J.i.81, with the gods of the thousand worlds, including Sakka, Suyáma, Santusita, Sunimmita, Vasavatti, etc.) appears before him and assures him there are many prepared to listen to him and to profit by his teaching, and so entreats him to teach the Dhamma. The Buddha accedes to his request and, after consideration, decides to teach the Dhamma first to the Pañcavaggiyas at Isipatana. On the way to </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; he meets the Ájívaka Upaka and tells him that he (the Buddha) is Jina. On his arrival at Isipatana the Pañcavaggiyas are, at first, reluctant to acknowledge his claim to be the Tathágata, but they let themselves be won over and, on the full-moon day of Ásálha, the Buddha preaches to them the sermon which came to be known as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. (Vin.i.4ff; M.i.118ff; cp. D.ii.36ff. Regarding the claim of this sutta to be the Buddha's first sermon, see Thomas, op. cit., p.86; see also Pañcavaggiyá). At the end of the sermon Kondañña becomes a sotápanna and they all become monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sermon is followed five days later by the Anattalakkhana Sutta, at the conclusion of which all five become arahants. The following day the Buddha meets Yasa, whom he converts. Yasa's father, who comes seeking him, is the first to take the threefold formula of Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasa becomes an arahant and is ordained. The Buddha accepts a meal at his house, and Yasa's mother and one of his former wives are the first two lay-women to become the Buddha's disciples. Then four friends of Yasa and, afterwards, fifty more, enter the Order and become arahants. There are now sixty arahants besides the Buddha, and they are sent in different directions to preach the Dhamma. They return with many candidates for admission to the Order, and the Buddha, who up till now had ordained men with the &quot;ehi bhikkhu&quot; formula, now allows the monks themselves to perform the ceremony of ordination (Vin.i.15ff; J.i.81f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending the rainy season at Benares (about this time Mára twice tries to tempt the Buddha, once after he had sent the disciples out to preach and once after the Retreat, S.i.105, 111; Vin.i.21, 22), the Buddha returns to Senánigáma in Uruvela, on the way </data>
<data>converting and ordaining the thirty Bhaddavaggiyá. At Uruvela, after a long and protracted exercise of magical powers, consisting in all of three thousand five hundred miracles, the Buddha wins over the three Kassapa brothers, the Tebhátika Jatilá, with their thousand followers, and ordains them. They become arahants after listening to the Ádittapariyáya Sutta preached at Gayásísa; with these followers he visits Rájagaha, where King Seniya Bimbisára comes to see him at the Latthivanuyyána. The following day the Buddha and the monks visit the palace, preceded by Sakka disguised as a youth and singing the praises of the Buddha. After the meal, the king gifts Veluvana to the Buddha and the Order. The Buddha stays for two months at Rájagaha (BuA.4), and it is during this time that Sáriputta and Moggallána join the Order, through the instrumentality of Assaji (Vin.i.23ff). It was probably during this year, at the beginning of the rainy season, that the Buddha visited Vesáli at the request of the Licchavis, conveyed through Maháli. The city was suffering from pestilence and famine. The Buddha went, preached the Ratana Sutta and dispelled all dangers (DhA.iii.436ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of converts now rapidly increases and the people of Magadha, alarmed by the prospect of childlessness, widow-hood, etc., blame the Buddha and his monks. The Buddha, however, refutes their charges (Vin.i.42f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account of the first twenty years of the Buddha's ministry is summarised from various sources, chiefly from Thomas's admirable account in his Life and Legend of the Buddha (pp.97ff). The necessary references are to be found under the names mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the full-moon day of Phagguna (February-March) the Buddha, accompanied by twenty thousand monks, sets out for Kapilavatthu at the express request of his father, conveyed through Káludáyí. </data>
<data>(This visit is not mentioned in the Canon; but see Thag.527-36; AA.i.107, 167; J.i.87; DhA.i.96f; ThagA.i.997ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By slow stages he arrives at the city, where he stays at the Nigrodháráma, and, in order to convince his proud kinsmen of his power, performs the Yamakapátihárjya and then relates the Vessantara Játaka. The next day, receiving no invitation to a meal, the Buddha begs in the streets of the city; this deeply grieves Suddhodana, but later, learning that it is the custom of all Buddhas, he becomes a sotápanna and conducts the Buddha and his monks to meal at the palace. There all the women of the palace, excepting only Ráhulamátá, come and do reverence to the Buddha. Mahá Pajápatí becomes a sotápanna and Suddhodana a sakadágámi. The Buddha visits Ráhulamátá in her own apartments and utters her praises in the Candakinnara Játaka. The following day the Buddha persuades his half-brother, Nanda, to come to the monastery, where he ordains him and, on the seventh day, he does the same with Ráhula. This is too great a blow for Suddhodana, and at his request the Buddha rules that no person shall be ordained without the consent of his parents. The next day the Buddha preaches to Suddhodana, who becomes an anágámí. During the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu, eighty thousand Sákyans join the Order, one from each family. With these he returns to Rájagaha, stopping on the way at Anupiya, where Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila and Devadatta, together with their barber, Upáli, visit him and seek ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his return to Rájagaha the Buddha resides in the Sítavana. (J.i.92, the story is also told in the Vinaya ii.154, but no date is indicated). There Sudatta, later known as Anáthapindika, visits him, is converted, and invites him to Sávatthi. The Buddha accepts the </data>
<data>invitation and journeys through Vesáli to Sávatthi, there to pass the rainy season. (Vin.ii.158; but see BuA.3, where the Buddha is mentioned as having spent the vassa in Rájagaha). Anáthapindika gifts Jetavana, provided with every necessity, for the residence of the Buddha and his monks. Probably to this period belongs the conversion of Migára, father-in-law of Visákhá, and the construction, by Visákhá, of the Pubbáráma at Sávatthi. The vassa of the fourth year the Buddha spends at Veluvana, where he converts Uggasena. (DhA.iv.59f). In the fifth year Suddhodana dies, having realised arahant-ship, and the Buddha flies through the air, from the Kútágárasálá in Vesáli where he was staying, to preach to his father on his death-bed. According to one account it is at this time that the quarrel breaks out between the Sákyans and the Koliyans regarding the irrigation of the river Rohiní. (AA.i.186; SNA.i.357; ThigA.141; details of the quarrel are given in J.v.412ff). The Buddha persuades them to make peace, and takes up his abode in the Nigrodháráma. Mahá Pajápatí Gotamí, with other Sákiyan women, visits him there and asks that women may be allowed to join the Order. Three times the request is made, three times refused, the Buddha then returning to Vesáli. The women cut off their hair, don yellow robes and follow him thither. Ananda intercedes on their behalf and their request is granted. (Vin.ii.253ff; A.iv.274f.; for details see Mahá Pajápati).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sixth year the Buddha again performs the Yamakapátiháriya, this time at the foot of the Gandamba tree in Sávatthi. Prior to this, the Buddha had forbidden any display of magic powers, but makes an exception in his own case (DhA.iii.199f.; J.iv.265, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spends the vassa at Mankulapabbata. After the performance of the miracle he follows the custom of all Buddhas and </data>
<data>ascends to Távatimsa in three strides to preach the Abhidhamma to his mother who is born there as a deva, and there he keeps the seventh vassa. The multitude, gathered at Sávatthi at the Yamakapátiháriya, refuse to go away until they have seen him. For three months, therefore, Moggallána expounds to them the Dhamma, while Culla Anáthapindika provides them with food. During the preaching of the Abhidhamma, Sáriputta visits the Buddha daily and learns from him all that has been recited the previous day. At the end of the vassa, the Buddha descends a jewelled staircase and comes to earth at Sankassa, thirty leagues from Sávatthi. (For details see Devorohana). It was about this time, when the Buddha's fame was at its height, that the notorious Ciñcá-mánaviká was persuaded by members of some hostile sect to bring a vile accusation against the Buddha. A similar story, told in connection with a paribbájiká named Sundarí, probably refers to a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eighth year the Buddha spends in the country of the Bhaggas and there, while residing in Bhesakalávana near Sumsumáragiri, he meets Nakulapitá and his wife, who had been his parents in five hundred former births (A.A.i.217). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is told of another old couple in Sáketa. See the Sáketa Játaka. The Buddha evidently stayed again at Sumsumáragiri many years later. It was during his second visit that Bodhirájakumára (q.v.) invited him to a meal at his new palace in order that the Buddha might consecrate the building by his presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ninth year the Buddha is at Kosambí. While on a visit to the Kuru country he is offered in marriage Mágandiyá, the beautiful daughter of the brahmin Mágandiyá. The refusal of the offer, accompanied by insulting remarks about physical beauty, arouses the enmity of Mágandiyá who, thenceforward, cherishes hatred against the Buddha.</data>
<data>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SN., pp.163ff; SNA.ii.542ff; DhA.i.199ff Thomas (op. cit., 109) assigns the Mágandiyá incident to the ninth year. I am not sure if this is correct, for the Commentaries say the Buddha was then living at Sávatthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tenth year there arises among the monks at Kosambí a schism which threatens the very existence of the Order. The Buddha, failing in his attempts to reconcile the disputants, retires in disgust to the Párileyyaka forest, passing on his way through Bálakalonakáragáma and Pácínavamsadáya. In the forest he is protected and waited upon by a friendly elephant who has left the herd. The Buddha spends the rainy season there and returns to Sávatthi. By this time the Kosambí monks have recovered their senses and ask the Buddha's pardon. This is granted and the dispute settled. (Vin.i.337ff; J.iii.486f; DhA.i.44ff; but see Ud.iv.5; s.v. Párileyyaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the eleventh year the Buddha resides at the brahmin village of Ekanálá and converts Kasi-Bháradvája (SN., p.12f.; S.i.172f). The twelfth year he spends at Verañjá, keeping the vassa there at the request of the brahmin Verañja. But Verañja forgets his obligations; there is a famine, and five hundred horse-merchants supply the monks with food. Moggallána's offer to obtain food by means of magic power is discouraged (Vin.iii.1ff; J.iii.494f; DhA.ii.153). The thirteenth Retreat is kept at Cálikapabbata, where Meghiya is the Buddha's personal attendant (A.iv.354; Ud.iv.1). The fourteenth year is spent at Sávatthi, and there Ráhula receives the upasampadá ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fifteenth year the Buddha revisits Kapilavatthu, and there his father-in-law, Suppabuddha, in a drunken fit, refuses to let the Buddha pass through the streets. Seven days later he is swallowed up by the earth at the foot of his palace (DhA.iii.44).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The chief event of the sixteenth year, which the Buddha spent at Álaví, is the conversion of the yakkha Álavaka. In the seventeenth year the Buddha is back at Sávatthi, but he visits Álaví again out of compassion for a poor farmer who becomes a sotápanna after hearing him preach (DhA.iii.262ff). He spends the rainy season at Rájagaha. In the next year he again comes to Álaví from Jetavana for the sake of a poor weaver's daughter. She had heard him preach, three years earlier, on the desirability of meditating upon death. She alone gave heed to his admonition and, when the Buddha knows of her imminent death, he journeys thirty leagues to preach to her and establish her in the sotápattiphala (DhA.iii.170ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Retreat of this year and also that of the nineteenth are spent at Cálikapabbata. In the twentieth year takes place the miraculous conversion of the robber Angulimála. He becomes an arahant and dies shortly after. It is in the same year that Ananda is appointed permanent attendant on the Buddha, a position which he holds to the end of the Buddha's life, twenty-five years later (For details see Ananda). The twentieth Retreat is spent at Rájagaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our present knowledge it is impossible to evolve any kind of chronology for the remaining twenty-five years of the Buddha's life. The Commentaries state that they were spent at Sávatthi in the monasteries of Jetavana and Pubbáráma. (E.g., BuA.3; SNA. p.336f, says that when the Buddha was at Sávatthi, he spent the day at the Migáramátupásáda in the Pubbáráma, and the night at Jetavana or vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, probably, only implies that the Retreats were kept there and that they were made the head quarters of the Buddha. From there, during the dry season, he went every year on tour in various </data>
<data>districts. Among the places visited by him during these tours are the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aggálavacetiya, Anotatta, Andhakavinda,   Ambapálivana, Ambalatthiká, Ambasandá, Assapura, Ápana, Icchánangala, Ukkatthá   (Subhagavana), Ukkácelá, Ugganagara, Ujuññá (Kannakatthaka deer-park), Uttara   in Koliya, Uttaraká, Uttarakuru, Uruvelakappa, Ulumpa, Ekanálá, Opasáda,   Kakkarapatta, Kajangalá (Mukheluvana), Kammássadhamma, Kalandakanivápa (near   Benares), Kimbilá, Kítágiri, Kundadhánavana (near Kundakoli), Kesaputta,   Kotigáma, Kosambí (Ghositáráma and Badarikáráma), Khánumata, Khomadussa,   Gosingasálavana, Candalakappa, Campá (Gaggará), Cátuma, Cetiyagiri in Vesáli,   Jívakambavana (in Rájagaha), Tapodáráma, Tindukkhánu (paribbájakáráma),   Todeyya, Thullakotthita, Dakkhinágiri, Dandakappa, Devadaha, Desaka in the   Sumbha country, Nagaraka, Nagaravinda, Nádiká (Giñjakávasatha), Nálandá (Pávárika   mango-grove), Nálakapána (Palásavana), Pankadhá, Pañcasalá, Pátikáráma, Beluva,   the Brahma world, Bhaddavatí, Bhaddiya (Játiyávana), Bhaganagara (Anandacetiya),   Maninálakacetiya, Mana-sákata, Mátulá, Mithilá (Makhádeva mango-grove),   Medatalumpa, Moranivápa, Rammaka's hermitage, Latthivana, Videha,   Vedhañña-ambavana, Venágapura, Verañjá, Veludvára, Vesáli (also various   shrines there, Udenacetiya, Gotamacetiya, Cápalacetiya, Bahuputta-kacetiya,   Sattambacetiya, Sárandadacetiya), Sakkara, Sajjanela, Salalágáraka in   Sávatthi, Sáketa (Añjanavana), Sámagáma, Sálavatiká, Sálá, Simsapávana,   Silávatí, Sítavana, Súkarakhatalena, Setavyá, Hatthigáma, Halidavassana and   the region of the Himálaya.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a more or less continuous account of the last year of the Buddha's life. This is contained in three suttas: the Mahá Parinibbána, the Mahá Sudassana and the Janavasabha. These are not </data>
<data>separate discourses but are intimately connected with each other. The only event prior to the incidents recounted in these suttas, which can be fixed with any certainty, is the death of the Buddha's pious patron and supporter, Bimbisára, which took place eight years before the Buddha's Parinibbána (Mhv.ii.32). It was at this time that Devadatta tried to obtain for himself a post of supremacy in the Order, and, failing in this effort, became the open enemy of the Buddha. Devadatta's desire to deprive the Buddha of the leadership of the Sangha seems to have been conceived by him, according to the Vinaya account (Vin.ii.184), almost immediately after he joined the Order, and the Buddha was warned of this by the devaputta Kakudha. This account lends point to the statement contained especially in the Northern books, that even in their lay life Devadatta had always been Gotama's rival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enlisting the support of Ajátasattu, he tried in many ways to kill the Buddha. Royal archers were bribed to shoot the Buddha, but they were won over by his personality and confessed their intentions. Then Devadatta hurled a great rock down Gijjhakúta on to the Buddha as he was walking in the shade of the hill; the hurtling rock was stopped by two peaks, but splinters struck the Buddha's foot and caused blood to flow; he suffered great pain and had to be taken to the Maddakucchi garden, where his injuries were dressed by the physician Jívaka (S.i.27). The monks wished to provide a guard, but the Buddha reminded them that no man had the power to deprive a Tathágata of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta next bribed the royal elephant keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nálágiri, intoxicated with toddy, on the road along which the Buddha would go, begging for alms. The Buddha was warned of this but disregarded the warning, and when the elephant appeared, Ananda, </data>
<data>against the strict orders of the Buddha, threw himself in its path, and only by an exercise of iddhi-power, including the folding up of the earth, could the Buddha come ahead of him. As the elephant approached, the Buddha addressed it, pervading it with his boundless love, until it became quite gentle. (This incident, with great wealth of detail, is related in several places - e.g., in J.v.333ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These attempts to encompass the Buddha's death having failed, Devadatta, with three others, decides to create a schism in the Order and asks the Buddha that five rules should be laid down, whereby the monks would be compelled to lead a far more austere life than hitherto. When this request is refused, Devadatta persuades five hundred recently ordained monks to leave Vesáli with him and take up their residence at Gayásísa, where he would set up an organisation similar to that of the Buddha. But, at the Buddha's request, Sáriputta and Moggallána visit the renegade monks; Sáriputta preaches to them and they are persuaded to return. When Devadatta discovers this, he vomits hot blood and lies ill for nine months. When his end approaches, he wishes to see the Buddha, but he dies on the way to Jetavana - whither he is being conveyed in a litter - and is born in Avíci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Gijjhakúta, near Rájagaha, the Buddha starts on his last journey. Just before his departure he is visited by Vassákára, and the talk is of the Vajjians; the Buddha preaches to Vassákára and the monks on the conditions that lead to prosperity. The Buddha proceeds with a large concourse of monks to Ambalatthiká and thence to Nálandá, where Sáriputta utters his lion-roar (síhanáda) regarding his faith in the Buddha. The Buddha then goes to Pátaligáma, where he talks to the villagers on the evil consequences of immorality and the advantages of morality. He utters a prophecy </data>
<data>regarding the future greatness of Pátaliputta and then, leaving by the Gotamadvára, he crosses the river Ganges at Gotamatittha. He proceeds to Kotigáma and thence to Ñátika, where he gives to Ananda the formula of the Dhammádása, whereby the rebirth of disciples could be ascertained. From Ñátika he goes to Vesáli, staying in the park of the courtesan Ambapáli. The following day he accepts a meal from Ambapáli, refusing a similar offer from the Licchavis; Ambapáli makes a gift of her park to the Buddha and his monks. The Buddha journeys on to Beluva, where he spends the rainy season, his monks remaining in Vesáli. At Beluva he falls dangerously ill but, with great determination, fights against his sickness. He tells Ananda that his mission is finished, that when he is dead the Order must maintain itself, taking the Dhamma alone as its refuge, and he concludes by propounding the four subjects of mindfulness (D.ii.100). The next day he begs in Vesáli and, with Ananda, visits the Cápála-cetiya. There he gives to Ananda the opportunity of asking him to live until the end of the kappa, but Ananda fails to take the hint. Soon afterwards Mára visits the Buddha and obtains the assurance that the Buddha's nibbána will take place in three months. There is an earthquake, and, in answer to Ananda's questions, the Buddha explains to him the eight causes of earthquakes. This is followed by lists of the eight assemblies, the eight stages of mastery and the eight stages of release. The Buddha then repeats to Ananda his conversation with Mára, and Ananda now makes his request to the Buddha to prolong his life, but is told that it is now too late; several opportunities he has had, of which he has failed to avail himself. The monks are assembled in Vesáli, in the Service Hall, and the Buddha exhorts them to practise the doctrines he has taught, in order that the religious life may last long. He then </data>
<data>announces his impending death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.549), after the rainy season spent at Beluva, the Buddha goes back to Jetavana, where he is visited by Sáriputta, who is preparing for his own Parinibbána at Nálakagáma. From Jetavana the Buddha went to Rájagaha, where Mahá-Moggallána died. Thence he proceeded to Ukkácelá, where he spoke in praise of the two chief disciples. From Ukkácelá he proceeded to Vesáli and thence to Bhandagáma. Ráhula, too, predeceased the Buddha (DA.ii.549).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, returning from Vesáli, he looks round at the city for the last time and goes on to Bhandagáma; there he preaches on the four things the comprehension of which destroys rebirth-noble conduct, earnestness in meditation, wisdom and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then passes through the villages of Hatthigáma, Ambagáma and Jambugama, and stays at Bhoganagara at the Ananda-cetiya. There he addresses the monks on the Four Great Authorities (Mahápadesá), by reference to which the true doctrine may be determined (Cf. A.ii.167ff). From Bhoganagara the Buddha goes to Pává and stays in the mango-grove of Cunda, the smith. Cunda serves him with a meal which includes súkaramaddava. (There is much dispute concerning this word. See Thomas, op. cit., 149, n.3). The Buddha alone partakes of the súkaramaddava, the remains being buried. This is the Buddha's last meal; sharp sickness arises in him, with flow of blood and violent, deadly pains, but the Buddha controls them and sets out for Kusinárá. On the way he has to sit down at the foot of a tree. Ananda fetches him water to drink from the stream Kakutthá, over which five hundred carts had just passed; but, through the power of the Buddha, the water is quite clear. Here the Buddha is visited by Pukkusa, the Mallan, who is converted and presents the Buddha with a pair of </data>
<data>gold-coloured robes. The Buddha puts them on and Ananda notices the marvellous brightness and clearness of the Buddha's body. The Buddha tells him that the body of a Buddha takes on this hue on the night before his Enlightenment and on the night of his passing away, and that he will die that night at Kusinárá. He goes to the Kákutthá, bathes and drinks there and rests in a mango-grove. There he instructs Ananda that steps must be taken to dispel any remorse that Cunda may feel regarding the meal he gave to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Kakutthá the Buddha crosses the Hiraññavatí to the Upavattana sála-grove in Kusinárá. There Ananda prepares for him a bed with the head to the north. All the trees break forth into blossom and flowers cover the body of the Buddha. Divine mandárava-flowers and sandalwood powder fall from the sky, and divine music and singing sound through the air. But the Buddha says that the greater honour to him would be to follow his teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gods of the ten thousand world systems assemble to pay their last homage to the Buddha, and Upavána, who stands fanning him, is asked to move away as he obstructs their view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda asks for instruction on several points, including how the funeral rites should be performed; he then goes out and abandons himself to a fit of weeping; the Buddha sends for him, consoles him and speaks his praises. Ananda tries to persuade the Buddha not to die in a mud-and-wattle village, such as is Kusinárá, but the Buddha tells him how it was once the mighty Kusávatí, capital of Mahásudassana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mallas of Kusinára are informed that the Buddha will pass away in the third watch of the night, and they come with their families to pay their respects. The ascetic Subhadda comes to see the </data>
<data>Buddha and is refused admission by Ananda, but the Buddha, overhearing, calls him in and converts him. Several minor rules of discipline are delivered, including the order for the excommunication of Channa. The Buddha finally asks the assembled monks to speak out any doubts they may have. All are silent and Ananda expresses his astonishment, but the Buddha tells him it is natural that the monks should have no doubts. Then, addressing the monks for the last time, he admonishes them in these words: &quot;Decay is inherent in all component things; work out your salvation with diligence.&quot; These were the Buddha's last words. Passing backwards and forwards through various stages of trance, he attains Parinibbána. There is a great earthquake and terrifying thunder, and the Brahmá Sahampati, Sakka king of the gods, Anuruddha and Ananda utter stanzas, each proclaiming the feeling uppermost in his mind. It is the full-moon day of the month of Visákha and the Buddha is in his eightieth year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day Ananda informs the Mallas of Kusinárá of the Buddha's death, and for seven days they hold a great celebration. On the seventh day, following Ananda's instructions, they prepare the body for cremation, taking it in procession by the eastern gate to the Makutabandhana shrine, thus altering their proposed route, in order to satisfy the wishes of the gods, as communicated to them by Anuruddha. The whole town is covered knee-deep with mandárava-flowers, which fall from the sky. When, however, four of the chief Mallas try to light the pyre, their attempt is unsuccessful and they must wait until Mahá Kassapa, coming with a company of five hundred monks, has saluted it. The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.603) add that Mahá Kassapa greatly desired that the Buddha's feet should rest on his head when he worshipped the pyre. The wish was granted: the feet appeared through the </data>
<data>pyre, and when Kassapa had worshipped them, the pyre closed together. The pyre burns completely away, leaving no cinders nor soot. Streams of water fall from the sky to extinguish it and the Mallas pour on it scented water. They then place a fence of spears around it and continue their celebrations for seven days. At the end of that period there appear several claimants for the Buddha's relics: Ajátasattu, the Licchavis of Vesáli, the Sákiyans of Kapilavatthu, the Bulis of Allakappa, the Koliyas of Rámagáma, a brahmin of Vethadípa and the Mallas of Pává. But the Mallas of Kusinárá refusing to share the relics with the others, there is danger of war. Then the brahmin Dona counsels concord and divides the relics into eight equal parts for the eight claimants. Dona takes for himself the measuring vessel and the Moriyas of Pipphalivana, who arrive late, carry off the ashes. Thúpas were built over these remains and feasts held in honour of the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concluding passage of the Mahá-Parinibbána Sutta (D.ii.167) states that the Buddha's relics were eight measures, seven of which were honoured in Jambudípa and the remaining one in the Nága realm in Rámagáma. One tooth was in heaven, one in Gandhára, a third in Kálinga (later taken to Ceylon), and a fourth in the Nága world. Ajátasattu's share was deposited in a thúpa and forgotten. It was later discovered by Asoka (with the help of Sakka) and distributed among his eighty-four thousand monasteries. Asoka also recorded the finding of all the other relics except those deposited in Rámagáma. These were later deposited in the Mahácetiya at Anurádhapura (Mhv.xxxi.17ff). Other relics are also mentioned, such as the Buddha's collar-bone, his alms bowl, etc. (Mhv.xvii.9ff; Mhv.i.37, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (E.g., DA.iii.899) that just </data>
<data>before the Buddha's Sásana disappears completely from the world, all the relics will gather together at the Mahácetiya, and travelling from there to Nágadípa and the Ratanacetiya, assemble at the Mahábodhi, together with the relics from other parts. There they will reform the Buddha's golden hued body, emitting the six-coloured aura. The body will then catch fire and completely disappear, amid the lamentations of the ten thousand world-systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ceylon Chronicles (Mhv.i.12ff; Dpv.i.45ff; ii.1ff etc.) record that the Buddha visited the Island on three separate occasions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(The Burmese claim that the Buddha   visited their land and went to the Lohitacandana Vihára, presented by the   brothers Mahápunna and Cúlapunna of Vánijagáma (Ind. Antiq.xxii., and   Sás.36f.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first was while he was dwelling at Uruvelá, awaiting the moment for the conversion of the Tebhátika Jatilas, in the ninth month after the Enlightenment, on the full-moon day of Phussa (Dec.-Jan.). He came to the Mahánága garden, and stood in the air over an assembly of yakkhas then being held. He struck terror into their hearts and, at his suggestion, they left Ceylon and went in a body to Giridípa, hard by. The Buddha gave a handful of his hair to the deva Mahásumana of the Sumanakúta mountain, who built a thúpa which was later enlarged into the Mahiyangana Thúpa. The Buddha again visited Ceylon in the fifth year, on the new-moon day of Citta (March-April), to check an imminent battle between two Nága chiefs in Nágadípa; the combatants were Mahodara and Cúlodara, uncle and nephew, and the object of the quarrel was a gem-set throne. The Buddha appeared before them, accompanied by the deva Samiddhi-Sumana, carrying a Rájayatana tree from Jetavana, settled their quarrel </data>
<data>and received, as a gift, the throne, the cause of the trouble. He left behind him both the throne and the Rájayatana tree for the worship of the Nágás and accepted an invitation from the Nága king, Maniakkhika of Kalyáni, to pay another visit to Ceylon. Three years later Maniakkhika repeated the invitation and the Buddha came to Kalyáni with five hundred monks, on the second day of Vesákha. Having preached to the Nágas, he went to Sumanakúta, on the summit of which mountain he left the imprint of his foot (Legend has it that other footprints were left by the Buddha, on the bank of the river Nammadá, on the Saccabaddha mountain and in Yonakapura). He then stayed at Díghavápí and from there visited Mahámeghavana, where he consecrated various spots by virtue of his presence, and proceeded to the site of the later Silácetiya. From there he returned to Jetavana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very little information as to the personality of the Buddha is available. We are told that he was golden-hued (E.g., Sp.iii.689), that his voice had the eight qualities of the Brahmassára (E.g., D.ii.211; M.ii.166f. It is said that while an ordinary person spoke one word, Ananda could speak eight; but the Buddha could speak sixteen to the eight of Ananda, MA.i.283) - fluency, intelligibility, sweetness, audibility, continuity, distinctness, depth and resonance - that he had a fascinating personality - he was described by his opponents as seductive (E.g., M.i.269, 275) - that he was handsome, perfect alike in complexion and stature and noble of presence (E.g., M.ii.167). He had a unique reputation as a teacher and trainer of the human heart. He was endowed with the thirty-two marks of the Mahápurisa. (For details of these, see Buddha). There is a legend that Mahá Kassapa, though slightly shorter, resembled the Buddha in appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Attempts made, however, to measure the Buddha always failed; two such attempts are generally mentioned - one by a brahmin of Rájagaha and the other by Ráhu, chief of the Asuras (DA.i.284f). The Buddha had the physical strength of many millions of elephants (e.g., VibhA.397), but his strength quickly ebbed away after his last meal and he had to stop at twenty-five places while travelling three gávutas from Pává to Kusinára (DA.ii.573).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is often made of the Buddha's love of quiet and peace, and even the heretics respected his wishes in this matter, silencing their discussions at his approach (E.g., D.i.178f; iii.39; even his disciples had a similar reputation, e.g., D.iii.37). Examples are given of the Buddha refusing to allow noisy monks to live near him. (E.g., M.i.456; see also M.ii.122, where a monk was jogged by his neighbour because he coughed when the Buddha was speaking). He loved solitude and often spent long periods away from the haunts of men, allowing only one monk to bring him his meals. E.g., S.v.12, 320; but this very love of solitude was sometimes brought against him. By intercourse with whom does he attain to lucidity in wisdom? they asked. His insight, they said, was ruined by his habit of seclusion (D.iii.38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one account (A.i.181), it was his practice to spend part of the day in seclusion, but he was always ready to see anyone who urgently desired his spiritual counsel (E.g., A.iv.438).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahá Govinda Sutta (D.ii.222f ) Sakka is represented as having uttered &quot;eight true praises&quot; of the Buddha. Perhaps the most predominant characteristics of the Buddha were his boundless love and his eagerness to help all who sought him. His fondness for children is seen in such stories as those of the two Sopákas, of Kumára-Kassapa, of Cúla </data>
<data>Panthaka and Dabba-Mallaputta and also of the novices Pandita and Sukha. His kindness to animals appears, for instance, in the introductory story of the Maccha Játaka and his interference on behalf of Udena's aged elephant, Bhaddavatiká (q.v.). The Buddha was extremely devoted to his disciples and encouraged them in every way in their difficult life. The Theragáthá and the Therígáthá are full of stories indicating that he watched, with great care, the spiritual growth and development of his disciples, understood their problems and was ready with timely interference to help them to win their aims. Such incidents as those mentioned in the Bhaddáli Sutta (M.i.445), the introduction to the Tittha Játaka and the Kañcakkhandha Játaka, seem to indicate that he took a personal and abiding interest in all who came under him. It was his unvarying custom to greet with a smile all those who visited him, inquiring after their welfare and thus putting them at their ease (Vin.i.313). When anyone sought permission to question him, he made no conditions as to the topic of discussion. This is called sabbaññupavárana. E.g., M.i.230. When the Buddha himself asked a question of any of his interrogators, they could not remain silent, but were bound to answer; a yakkha called Vajirapáni was always present to frighten those who did not wish to do so (e.g., M.i.231). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha was not over-anxious to get converts, and when his visitors declared themselves his followers he would urge them to take time to consider the matter - e.g., in the case of Acela Kassapa and Upáligahapati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was staying in a monastery, he paid daily visits to the sick ward to talk to the inmates and to comfort them (See, e.g., Kutágárasálá). The charming story of Pútigata-Tissa shows that he sometimes attended on the sick himself, thus setting an example to his </data>
<data>followers. In return for his devotion, his disciples adored him, but even among those who immediately surrounded him there were a few who refused to obey him implicitly - e.g., Láludáyí, the companions of Assaji and Punabbasuka, the Chabbaggiyas, the Sattarasavaggiyas and others, not to mention Devadatta and his associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha seems to have shown a special regard for Sáriputta, Ananda and Mahá Kassapa among the monks, and for Anáthapindika, Malliká, Visakhá, Bimbisára and Pasenadi among the laity. He seems to have been secretly amused by the very human qualities of Pasenadi and by his failure to appreciate the real superiority of Malliká, his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha always declared that he was among the happy ones of this earth, that he was far happier, for instance, than Bimbisára (E.g., M.i.94), and he remained unmoved by opposition or abuse. E.g., in the case of the organised conspiracy of Mágandiyá (DhA.iv.1f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milindapañha (p.134) mentions several illnesses of the Buddha: the injury to his foot has already been referred to; once when the humours of his body were disturbed Jívaka administered a purge (Vin.i.279); on another occasion he suffered from some stomach trouble which was cured by hot water, or, according to some, by hot gruel (Vin.i.210f.; Thag.185). The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.232; ThagA.i.311f) mentions another disorder of the humours cured by hot water obtained from the brahmin Devahita, through Upavána. The Commentaries mention that he suffered, in his old age, from constant backache, owing to the severe austerities practised by him during the six years preceding his Enlightenment, and the unsuitable meals taken during that period were responsible for a dyspepsia which persisted throughout the rest of his life (SA.i.200), </data>
<data>culminating in his last serious illness of dysentery. MA.i.465; DA.iii.974; see also D.iii.209, when he was preaching to the Mallas of Pává.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána (Ap.i.299f) contains a set of verses called Pubbakammapiloti; these verses mention certain acts done by the Buddha in the past, which resulted in his having to suffer in various ways in his last birth. He was once a drunkard named Munáli and he abused the Pacceka Buddha Surabhi. On another occasion he was a learned brahmin, teacher of five hundred pupils. One day, seeing the Pacceka Buddha Isigana, he spoke ill of him to his pupils, calling him &quot;sensualist.&quot; The result of this act was the calumny against him by Sundariká in this life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another life he reviled a disciple of a Buddha, named Nanda; for this he suffered in hell for twelve thousand years and, in his last life, was disgraced by Ciñcá. Once, greedy for wealth, he killed his step-brothers, hurling them down a precipice; as a result, Devadatta attempted to kill him by hurling down a rock. Once, as a boy, while playing on the highway, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and threw a stone at him, and as a result, was shot at by Devadatta's hired archers. In another life he was a mahout, and seeing a Pacceka Buddha on the road, drove his elephant against him; hence the attack by Nálágiri. Once, as a king, he sentenced seventy persons to death, the reward for which he reaped when a splinter pierced his foot. Because once, as a fisherman's son, he took delight in watching fish being caught, he suffered from a grievous headache when Vidúdabha slaughtered the Sákiyans. In the time of Phussa Buddha he asked the monks to eat barley instead of rice and, as a result, had to eat barley for three months at Verañja. (According to the Dhammapada Commentary [iii.257], the Buddha actually had to starve one day at Pañcasálá, </data>
<data>because none of the inhabitants were willing to give him alms.) Because he once killed a wrestler, he suffered from cramp in the back. Once, when a physician, he caused discomfort to a merchant by purging him, hence his last illness of dysentery. As Jotipála, he spoke disparagingly of the Enlightenment of Kassapa Buddha, and in consequence had to spend six years following various paths before becoming the Buddha. He was one of the most short-lived Buddhas, but because of those six years his Sásana will last longer (Sp.i.190f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha was generally addressed by his own disciples as Bhagavá. He spoke of himself as Tathágata, while non-Buddhists referred to him as Gotama or Mahásamana. Other names used are Mahámuni, Sákyamuni, Jina, Sakka (e.g., Sn.vs.345) and Brahma (Sn.vs.91; SnA.ii.418), also Yakkha (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikáya (A.i.23ff) gives a list of the Buddha's most eminent disciples, both among members of the Order and among the laity. Each one in the list is mentioned as having possessed pre-eminence in some particular respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who visited the Buddha for discussion or had interviews with him or received instruction and guidance direct from him, the following may be included in addition to those already mentioned (this list does not pretend to be complete; some of the names have already been mentioned in this monograph in various connections): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ankura, Aggidatta, Acela-Kassapa,   Ajátasattu, Ajita the Paribbájaka, Ajita the Licchavi general, Attadattha,   Anitthigandhakumára, Anuráddha, Anuruddha, Annabhára, Abhaya-rájakumára,   Abhayá, Abhiñjaka, Abhibhúta, Abhirúpa-Nandá, Ambattha, the monk Arittha,   Ariya the fisherman, Asama, Asibandhaputta, Assaji, Assaláyana, Ákotaka,   Ámagandha, the yakkhas Álavaka and Indaka, Ugga of Vesáli, Ugga the minister, </data>

On this occasion of his coming he preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aadittapariyaaya_s')"&gt;Adittapariyáya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.34f; S.iv.19f; J.i.82; AA.i.57, etc.; PvA.21; Ud.i.9; DhA.i.72).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; managed to win over five hundred of the monks to his side, it was to Gayásísa that he retired with them, and there it was that the Buddha's Chief Disciples had to go to reclaim them (Vin.ii.199; DhA.i.121; J.i.142, 425, 490f; iv.180). It is said (J.i.185, 508; ii.38f) that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt; built a special monastery for Devadatta at Gayásísa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (SA.iii.4; UdA.74) say that the hill was so called because it was composed of a flat stone and was shaped like an elephant's head (gaja-sísa-sadisa-pitthipásáno). There was room on the rock for one thousand monks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hill stands about one mile to the south-west of Gayá and is now called Brahmayoni. To the south-east of the hill &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt; saw the three thúpas of the Tebhátika Jatilá (CAGI.524f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="gayaa_s')"&gt;Gayá Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha stayed there on various occasions during his visits to Nádiká. It was during one of these visits that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambapaalii')"&gt;Ambapáli&lt;/a&gt; presented her park to the Buddha and the Order (Vin.i.232).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Giñjakávasatha the Buddha preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_gosinga_s')"&gt;Cúlagosinga Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.205), the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/janavasabha')"&gt;Janavasabha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.200) and several discourses on marana-sati (E.g., A.iii.303f; 306f; 391f; iv.320f); also the sermons to the Elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sandha')"&gt;Sandha&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaccaana')"&gt;Kaccánagotta&lt;/a&gt; (A.v.322f) and the Elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaccaayana')"&gt;Kaccáyana&lt;/a&gt; (S.ii.153f; see also S.ii.74; iv.90).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both in the Janavasabha Sutta and the &lt;a href="ginjakaavasatha_s')"&gt;Giñjakávasatha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.356f), which was preached at the same place, the Buddha is represented as having answered questions regarding the destiny and the rebirth of several residents of Nádiká. Does this perhaps mean that the people of Nádiká were more interested in this problem than the people of other places? It was by way of finding a permanent solution to these questions that the Buddha preached to Ananda at Giñjakávasatha the Dhammá-dása (Mirror of Truth) on his last visit to Nádiká, as described in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaparinibbana_s')"&gt;Mahá Parinibbána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.91ff; see also S.v.357).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.424) state that once the Buddha arrived at Nádiká while travelling in the Vajji country, and the people there built for him a residence entirely made of bricks (giñjaká), </data>
<data>hence its name. Later, residences were also built for the monks, complete with all requirements. The bricks were evidently a special architectural feature, and this con-firms the belief that buildings were generally of wood. The &quot;Brick Hall&quot; was, however, not designed for the Buddha and his monks alone, for we find mention of members of other sects staying there - e.g., the Paribbájaka &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya')"&gt;Sabhiya Kaccána&lt;/a&gt; (S.iv.401). The building was probably a resting place for all travellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha answers that he should be asked to take comfort in his loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and in his possession of the Ariyan virtues. He should be shown the futility of longing for parents, children and sensual pleasures, and should be persuaded, if possible, to aspire not after rebirth, but after emancipation.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gadrabhapañha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems set by King Vedeha to Mahosadha, in order to test him, at the instigation of the king's ministers. The king sent word to Mahosadha that while he was on his way to see him his horse had broken its leg; would Mahosadha therefore, send him a more excellent horse? Mahosadha, understanding the significance of the message, went to the palace, sending his father on before him. When Mahosadha entered he found his father seated, but, as had been prearranged, he obliged his father to get up and offer him his seat. On this there was a great uproar, all saying that he had slighted his father. But Mahosadha convinced the king that he was a more excellent man than his father, giving proof of this by producing before the king an ass which he had brought with him, and making the king acknowledge that a colt born of the ass through a Sindh mare would be far more valuable than the colt's sire (J.vi.342f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is also given as a separate Játaka (No.111).

The king grew fond of him, and the monkey learnt the ways of men. The king set him free, and when his fellows saw him they insisted on hearing from him how men lived. He told them of men's greed for possessions, and how in each house there were two masters, one of them beardless, with long breasts and plaited hair. The monkeys, hearing of this folly, stopped their ears and went elsewhere, saying they could not bear to live in a place where they had heard such unseemly things! That place came thereafter to be called the Garahitapitthi-pásána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a discontented monk. J.ii.184.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He warned his men that they should not eat anything found in the forest without first consulting him. On the way they came across leaves strewn in the forest, covered with honeycomb. These had been placed there by a yakkha, named Gumbiya, who had put poison in the honey. Some of the men ate the honey, while others remembered the warning of the Bodhisatta as soon as they had tasted it. Those who ate died, the others were given emetics and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a monk who, fascinated by a woman's charm, wished to become a layman. Sensuous pleasures are like honey sprinkled with deadly poison, said the Buddha. The monk became a sotápanna. J.iii.200f.; cp. Kimpakka Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once, when Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila were living there, they were visited by the Buddha, who came from Giñjakávasatha. The result of the visit was the preaching of the Cúlagosinga Sutta (q.v.)

On another occasion, when the Buddha was staying there with many eminent monks, among whom were Sáriputta, Moggallána and others, their conversation led to the preaching of the Mahágosinga Sutta (q.v.)

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gangátíriya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He was a householder named Datta of Sávatthi. On discovering that he had, though unwittingly, committed incest with both his mother and sister, he was overcome with anguish and left the world. He adopted a course of austerity, dwelling in a hut of palm leaves on the bank of the Ganges, hence his name. For a whole year he kept silence; in the second year he spoke but once to a woman who, in filling his bowl, spilt the milk, wishing to discover if he were dumb. In the third year he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a householder, and supplied drinks to monks (Thag.v.127-8; ThagA.i.248f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (ThagA.195f.; Thig.224f) that after Gangátiriya's conception his mother was driven out of her house in the absence of her husband, her mother-in-law suspecting her of infidelity. The child was born in a travellers' rest-house in Rájagaha, whither she had gone in search of her husband, and was taken away by a caravan leader who happened to see it when its mother was away bathing. Later the woman was carried away by a robber chief, by whom she had a daughter. One day, in a quarrel with her husband, she threw her daughter on the bed, wounding her on the head, and fearing her husband's wrath she fled to Rájagaha, where she became a courtesan and later mistress of Gangátiriya, who was unaware of his relationship to her. Some time afterwards he took to wife the robber's daughter as well. One day, while looking at the young wife's head, the older one saw the wound, and as a result of her questions learnt the truth. Filled with dismay, both mother and daughter became nuns, and Gangátiriya left the world as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gangátiriya is perhaps to be identified with Udakadáyaka of the Apadána.

Having seen Yamakapátiháriya, he entered the Order and lived in a spot called Gahvaratíra - hence his name - and there in due course became an arahant. On his return to Sávatthi, his relations held a great almsgiving in his honour and requested him to live near them. But be refused this request and returned to the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a hunter in the time of Sikhí Buddha, and was delighted by the sound of the Buddha's voice as he preached (Thag.v.31; ThagA.i.91).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Ghosasaññaka of the Apadána (Ap.ii.451), but the same verses are also attributed to Dhammika.

It is said that Mahásíva was explaining to him the Mahá Saccaka Sutta, and that when he came to the passage where the Buddha charges Saccaka with not understanding the training of the body, much less that of the mind, Gonaraviya laid aside his fan and walked away, saying that the Buddha could not have said such a thing; but Mahásíva persuaded him that it was so. v.l.

To him comes also the confidence that he is free from birth in a Niraya, among beasts or petas or in unhappy states, and that he is a sotápanna. A.iii.211f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the son of Mahánága of Nitthulavitthika and owed his name to his dwarfish stature. He pulled up imbara-trees from a forest clearing, thus demonstrating his enormous strength. Kákavannatissa, hearing of this, sent for him to the court (Mhv.xxiii.49ff; the Rasaváhini ii.28, says he subdued a yakkha named Jayasena). He took a prominent part in the attack on Vijitapura, using a coconut-palm as weapon (Mhv.xxv.27, 32, 44f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MT.452) that in the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave daily milk rice to the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Ras.ii.87f, which says that he was so called because he was short, but that according to the Uttara-vihára monks he was given the name because, when he went hunting, he killed animals by dashing them on kotthayimbara-trees. Once when he was holding a feast in his house, after defeating the Damilas, a Yakkha, named Jayasena of Aritthapabbata, happened to pass by, and, entering the house, fell in love with G.'s wife. G. challenged him to a fight and defeated him. He celebrated the victory for seven days and went to the palace drunk. Being refused admission, he swam across to Kávírapattana, and, having gone as far as the Himálaya in search of holy monks, was about to kill himself in despair when an arahant Thera appeared before him and ordained him. He later attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Gandha.&lt;/b&gt;-A setthi of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. On realising that his ancestors had died leaving immense wealth, which they had failed to enjoy, he started to spend large sums of money on luxuries, and one full-moon day he decorated the city and invited the people to watch him taking a meal. Among the assembled multitude was a villager, who felt that he would die unless he could obtain a morsel of Gandha's rice. When this was told to Gandha he suggested that the man should work for him for three years, taking in payment a bowl of his rice. The villager agreed and henceforth became known as Bhattabhatika. At the end of the three years Gandha kept his promise and gave orders that Bhattabhatika should enjoy all his master's own splendours for one day, and asked all the members of his household, except his wife Cintámaní, to wait on him. When Bhattabhatika sat down to eat, a Pacceka Buddha appeared before him; Bhattabhatika gave his food to the Pacceka Buddha who, in sight of all those that had gathered to watch Bhattabhatika's splendour, went through the air to Gandhamádana. When Gandha heard of what bad happened, he gave one-half of all his possessions to Bhattabhatika in return for a share of the merit he had gained.

He was unmarried and supported his blind parents. He had as pupil Músila from Ujjeni, and to him Guttila taught all he knew. Later, Guttila introduced Músila at the king's court where, as soon as he had the ear of the king, he arranged for a competition with his master, that the king might decide who should be the court musician. Guttila, fearing a contest in his old age, fled into the forest where Sakka appeared before him and promised to help him to victory. The contest was held, and when Guttila played according to Sakka's instructions, the sound of his music filled the city and heavenly nymphs descended to earth to dance. Músila was defeated and stoned to death by the enraged crowd. Later, Sakka sent Mátali to fetch Guttila to Távatimsa in his chariot, and as a return for his music Guttila was allowed to discover to what good deeds the inhabitants of Távatimsa owed their birth there. On returning to earth after seven days, he told the people what he had seen and exhorted them to do good (J.ii.248ff; VvA.137ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that once Guttila sent a thousand to a woman, wishing to win her favour, but she would not grant it. He decked himself, and in the evening sang and played his lute outside her house. She was so enthralled by his music that she opened her window and, thinking it was a door, walked out and was killed by the fall (AA.i.16f; is this perhaps a different person?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guttila is mentioned (Mil.115, 291) as one of the four human beings who went to Távatimsa even in their human body, the others being Sádhína, Nimi and Mandhátá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha turned off the main road and, when be came to the spot which had once been Vehalinga, he smiled. Being asked by Ananda the reason for his smile, the Buddha related to him and to the monks the story of Ghatíkára, the potter of Vehalinga, as given above (M.ii.45ff). It is said (MA.ii.717) that the Buddha wished to make known to the monks the great piety of Ghatíkára. The sutta was repeated at a shrine near Todeyya, which was being worshipped by the people without their knowing its significance. The Buddha related the sutta and explained that the shrine was the thúpa of Kassapa Buddha. DhA.iii.251.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

They came to a sála-grove and there the Buddha smiled; when asked the reason for his smile, he replied that the grove was the scene of Gavesí's practice of the religious life.

One day, when on his way with his wife to visit her parents, they came to a stream, and, while they were hesitating before crossing, a man named Díghapitthi came along and offered to take them across, because, he said, he was well known to the denizens of the river. He took Díghatálá first, with the sweetmeats intended for her relations, and persuaded her to come with him, leaving her husband. When Golakála realised what had happened, he jumped into the stream in desperation, easily crossing it - because it was really very shallow - and claimed his wife. In the course of the quarrel between the two men they came to where Mahosadha held court, and be, having heard their respective stories, decided, with the approval of the assembled populace, in favour of Golakála.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said Golakála was so called because he was dwarfish, like a ball (gola), and black (kála).

(It was so even in times gone by, see, e.g., J.ii.55). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been attracted by its solitude, and is mentioned as having visited it on several occasions, sometimes even in the dark, in drizzling rain, while &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara')"&gt;Mára&lt;/a&gt; made unsuccessful attempts to frighten him (S.i.109).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on the slopes of Gijjhakúta, where the Buddha was wandering about, that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; hurled at him a mighty stone to kill him, but only a splinter injured his foot (Vin.ii.193, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was there also that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jiivaka')"&gt;Jívaka Komára-bhacca&lt;/a&gt; administered a purgative to the Buddha (AA.i.216). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who visited the Buddha on Gijjhakúta are mentioned: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sahampati')"&gt;Sahampati&lt;/a&gt; (S.i.153), &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the youth &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagha')"&gt;Mágha&lt;/a&gt; (Sn., p.86), &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Yakkha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/inda')"&gt;Inda&lt;/a&gt; (S.i.206), &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; (S.i.233; iv.102), &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Paribbájaka &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s2_sal')"&gt;Sajjha&lt;/a&gt; (A.iv.371), &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapagotta')"&gt;Kassapagotta&lt;/a&gt; monk (A.i.237), &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;</data>

<data>test his capabilities (Vin.ii.76; DhA.iii.321f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made of several eminent monks who stayed at Gijjhakúta from time to time - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.263; A.iii.300; S.ii.155), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.383), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punna')"&gt;Punna Mantániputta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaali')"&gt;Upáli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;  Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; (S.ii.155),&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda')"&gt;Cunda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt; (S.iv.55). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channa fell ill there, and ultimately committed suicide. (Another monk is mentioned as having thrown himself down from Gijjhakúta because he was discontented with his life, Vin.iii.82. According to one account, AA.i.146f, Vakkali, too, committed suicide by throwing himself from Gijjhakúta; but see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vakkali')"&gt;Vakkali&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lakkhana')"&gt;Lakkhana&lt;/a&gt; are reported to have stayed there, and to have seen many inhabitants of Rájagaha reborn in Gijjhakúta as petas (S.ii.254; Vin.iii.104; for Moggallána see also A.iv.75).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mettiyabhummajaka')"&gt;Mettiya-bhummajakas&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.iii.167) and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chabbaggiyaa')"&gt;Chabbaggiyas&lt;/a&gt; (ibid., 82) were also in the habit of visiting the hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several places are mentioned as having </data>
<data>been visited by the Buddha during his sojourns on Gijjhakúta, and it may be inferred from accounts given of these visits that these places were within easy reach of the hill. Such, for example, are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Patibhánakúta (S.v.448),  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sitavana')"&gt;Sítavana&lt;/a&gt;, where the Buddha went to visit &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sona')"&gt;Sona&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.374),  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the river &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sappini')"&gt;Sappiní&lt;/a&gt;, on the banks of which lived various &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paribbajaka')"&gt;Paribbájakas&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabha')"&gt;Sarabha&lt;/a&gt; (A.i.185; ii.29, 176),  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Paribbájakárama of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udumbarikaa')"&gt;Udumbariká&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigrodha')"&gt;Nigrodha&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/moranivapa')"&gt;Moranivápa&lt;/a&gt; on the bank of the lake &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumaagadhaa')"&gt;Sumágadhá&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.39), and  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the park &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maddakucci')"&gt;Maddakucchi&lt;/a&gt;, where the Buddha was removed after the injury to his foot (DhA.ii.164).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suukarakhatalena')"&gt;Súkara-khatalena&lt;/a&gt; was on the slope of Gijjhakúta, and there the Buddha was once visited by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighanakha')"&gt;Díghanakha&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.233; M.i.497).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jiivaka')"&gt;Jívaka's&lt;/a&gt; mango-grove lay between Gijjhakúta and the walls of Rájagaha (DA.i.150).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gijjhakúta was so called, either </data>
<data>because its peak was like a vulture's beak, or because it was the resort of many vultures (SNA.ii.417; AA.i.412; MA.i.291, etc). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunningham (CAGI.534), on the authority of both Fa Hien and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt;, identifies Gijjhakúta with the modern Sailagiri, about two and a half miles to the north-east of the old town. It is also called Giriyek Hill. Gijjhakúta is sometimes referred to as Gijjhapabbata (J.ii.50; iii.255, 484) and as Gijjha. J.vi.204, 212.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Gayá.-&lt;/b&gt;A pond in which people bathed, that their sins might be washed away (J.v.388f). Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.145) it was a circular pond in which was a bathing ghat (mandavápisanthánam tittham). But see below, Gayá (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gayá.&lt;/b&gt;-A town in India. It lay on the road between the Bodhi-tree and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, and was three gávutas from the Bodhi-tree and fifteen yojanas from Benares. (MA.i.387f; Fa Hien says the distance from the Bodhi-tree to Gayá, was twenty li, or about 3 1/3 miles). It was between the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhimanda')"&gt;Bodhimanda&lt;/a&gt; and Gayá that the Buddha, on his way to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt;, met &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka')"&gt;Upaka&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.8).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha stayed at Gayá on several occasions: once at &lt;a href="gayaasiisa')"&gt;Gayásísa&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.34; S.iv.19; A.iv.302), and also near the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tankitamanca')"&gt;Tankitamañca&lt;/a&gt; (Sn. p.47; S.i.207, etc.), the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suciloma')"&gt;Suciloma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; says that Gayá was the name given both to the village and a bathing ghat near to it (also called Gayápokkharaní). Dhamma-pála (UdA.74, 75; cp. SNA.i.301), on the other hand, speaks of a Gayánadí and a Gayápokkharaní as being two distinct bathing ghats, both commonly called Gayátittha, and both considered to possess the power of washing away sins. People went there, offered sacrifices to the gods, recited the Vedas, and immersed themselves in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere (ThagA.i.388f, 418; Thag.v.287) it is stated that every year, in the earlier half of the month of </data>
<data>Phagguna (March), people held a bathing festival at the bathing ghat at Gayá, the festival being called Gayáphagguní. It was at one of these festivals that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/senaka')"&gt;Senaka Thera&lt;/a&gt; was converted by the Buddha. This explanation of Gayáphaggu is, perhaps, not quite correct, for, according to some, the river (Nerañjará) which ran by Gayá was itself called Phaggu (Skt. Phaggu). E.g., Cunningham: AGI.524; Böthlinck and Roth's Dict. s.v. Phalgu; Neumann (Majh. N. Trans.i.271) says that the village of Gayá itself was called Phaggu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town of Gayá is often called Brahmagayá to distinguish it from Buddhagayá (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On coming to visit &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, he saw Udena there in Khemiyambavana and had a conversation with him, recorded in the Ghotamukha Sutta. At the conclusion of the talk he declared himself converted and wished to offer to Udena the daily allowance of five hundred kahápanas which he regularly received from the king of Anga. Udena suggested that the money might be utilised to build an assembly-hall for the Order at Pátaliputta. The suggestion was agreed to and the assembly-hall, when built, was called Ghotamukhí (M.ii.157ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (MA.ii.786f) adds that Ghotamukha held the view that one should seek self-glorification, even by the slaughter of one's parents, and that he was the only person born in heaven, in spite of having held that view. After his birth in heaven, having discovered the cause of his good fortune, be came to earth in disguise and, after revealing his identity to his only remaining sister, told her where his treasures were hidden and instructed her to spend some of the money on renovating an old refectory which the monks were trying to restore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

But, seeing no one worthy of such honour and respect, he decided that the Dhamma should be his teacher. Thereupon Sahampati appeared before him and reminded him that in this decision he was acting as all Buddhas acted. S.i.138f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Gokanna.-A locality in Ceylon and a vihára founded by Mahásena, on the site of a Hindu temple (Mhv.xxxvii.41). According to the Mahávamsa Tíká (p.685), it was on the east coast of Ceylon. Elsewhere (p.269), the Tíká speaks of a Gokannatittha in the neighbourhood of the estuary of the Mahákandara-nadí, and the Cúlavamsa (lxxi.18) mentions Gokanna as the last of a series of fords in Rohana, important from a strategic point of view, along the Mahá-válkaugangá, from &quot;Sarogámatittha to Gokanna.&quot; In another passage (Cv.xli.79), Gokanna(ka) is spoken of as mahannava (the ocean). These facts support Geiger's conjecture (Cv. Trs.i.59, 4; n.316, n.2) that Gokanna refers to the Trincomalee (Koddiyar) Bay at the estuary of the Maháválukagangá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gokanna(ka) is twice described as the scene of magic rites, once in the case of Mahánága (Cv.xli.79) and again in that of Mánavamma (Cv.lvii.5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggabodhi V. built a padhánaghara for the Gokanna-vihára.

At a meeting between him and Parakkamabáhu at Buddhagáma, the latter won him over to his side. An amusing story is told of a dream he had after his promise of help to Parakkamabáhu (Cv.lxvi.47ff). He fled, therefore, to Kálavápi and, on various occasions, offered battle to the forces of Parakkamabáhu, but everywhere he was defeated, the worst reverse being at Nílagala by the general Máyágeha.

The last we hear of him is of his incitement of Mánábharana to seize the throne (Cv.lxiii.34; lxvi.35ff, 62; lxx.68, 71, 83, 257). Geiger thinks (Cv. Trs i.255, n.3) that Gokanna is </data>

The latter was a follower of the Buddha, and the former of the Niganthas. Instigated by the Niganthas, Garahadinna constantly blamed his friend for his allegiance to the Buddha, until one day, in exasperation, Sirigutta invited the Niganthas to his house in order to prove that their claim to omniscience was false. To this end he had a ditch dug and filled with filth, ropes stretched longitudinally over the ditch, and the seats so arranged that the moment the Niganthas sat down they would be tipped over and flung into the ditch. The Niganthas arrived, and everything happened as Sirigutta had arranged. Garahadinna, filled with desire for revenge, hid his resentment and invited the Buddha and his disciples with the intention of humiliating them. He employed the same stratagem as his friend, except that the ditch was filled with glowing coals instead of with filth. The Buddha came, knowing all that had happened, and by an exercise of iddhi-power caused large lotus flowers to spring up from the bed of coals. Sitting thereon, he created an abundant supply of food and preached the Dhamma. Garahadinna, Sirigutta, and many others became sotápannas (DhA.i.434f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this occasion was also preached the Khadirangára Játaka. (But see the introductory Story of the Játaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mil.350) that when the Buddha preached at Garahadinna's house, eighty-four thousand beings realised the Truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Godhika Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of a Malla chief in Pává. He went to Kapilavatthu with his friends, Subáhu, Valliya and Uttiya, and there he saw the Twin Miracle and joined the Order, later attaining arahantship. (But see below.) At Rájagaha, Bimbisára built a hut for him but forgot the roof. The gods prevented rain from falling till this error was rectified. Godhika and his friends had been companions in good deeds in the past, especially in the time of Siddhattha Buddha and of Kassapa Buddha. Eighty-seven kappas ago Godhika was seven times king, under the name of Mahásena (Thag.vs.51; ThagA.i.123f; Ap.i.140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta (S.i.120f; SA.i.144f; also DhA.i.431f ) account, Godhika lived on the Kálasilá in Isigilipassa. There he made various vain attempts to win arahantship (the DhA.i.431f adds that he suffered from a disease brought about by hard work), achieving only temporary emancipation of mind, from which he then fell away. Six times this happened and then he decided to commit suicide by cutting his throat. Mára saw this and reported it to the Buddha, but when the Buddha arrived it was too late and Godhika lay &quot;supine on his couch with his shoulders twisted around.&quot; The Buddha, however, declared that Godhika had attained Nibbána. The Commentary states that, after cutting his throat, Godhika so checked his final agony that he won arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Gandhára- or Gandhárí-vijjá&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A charm whereby one could become invisible and multiform, pass through all obstacles, through earth and water, and touch the sun and moon (D.i.213). Elsewhere (J.iv.498) the charm is mentioned as being only useful for the purpose of making oneself invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá Commentary (I.51f) distinguishes a Lesser and a Greater. Pilinda-vaccha knew the former and thought that the Buddha would teach him the other. The charm enabled him to travel through the air and read the thoughts of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa (DA ii.389) explains that the charm was so called, either because it was invented by a sage named Gandhára, or because it originated in Gandhára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

M.iii.69; ApA.i.106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gandhára.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the sixteen&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada')"&gt;Mahájanapadas&lt;/a&gt; (countries) (A.i.213; iv.252, etc.; in the Niddesa and Mahávastu lists Gandhára is omitted and others substituted). Its capital was Takkasilá, famous for its university; its king in the time of the Buddha was Pukkusáti. There was friendly intercourse between him and Bimbisára of Magadha. Merchants and visitors from one country to another were lodged and fed at the expense of the country's king, and no tariffs were levied on their merchandise. There was constant exchange of goods and valuables, and on one occasion Bimbisára, wishing to send his friend a gift of particular value, despatched to him a letter containing news of the appearance in the world of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. When Pukkusáti read the letter he decided to become a follower of the Buddha, and ordained himself as a monk; then, leaving his kingdom, he travelled all the way to Sávatthi to see the Buddha (MA.ii.979ff). This conversion of Gandhára's' king, however, does not seem to have had the effect of converting the rest of its people to the Buddha's faith. The memory of Pukkusáti was evidently soon forgotten, for we find Moggaliputta Tissa, at the conclusion of the Third Council, sending the Thera Majjhantika to convert Gandhára (Mhv.xii.3ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa's account, Pukkusáti's kingdom was over one hundred leagues in extent (MA.ii.988), and the distance from Takkasilá to Sávatthi was one hundred and ninety-two leagues (MA.ii.987; from Benares it was one hundred and twenty leagues, vísamyo-janasata; J.i.395; ii.47). There was evidently a </data>
<data>well-known caravan route linking the two countries, although Gandhára was regarded as a paccantima janapada. (MA.ii.982; there was also constant trade between Gandhára and Videha, J.iii.365ff. It would appear from the Mahá Niddesa i.154 that Takkasilá was a regular centre of trade).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of Majjhantika's visit, the people of Gandhára were being harassed by the Nága-king Aravála, and the chronicles contain details of his conversion by the monk. The Nága-king, together with his retinue, the yakkha Pandaka and his wife Háritá, became devout followers of the Buddha. Majjhantika preached the Ásívisúpama Sutta, and many thousands joined the Order. (Mhv.xii.9ff; Smp.i.64f; Dpv.viii.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gandhára appears to have included Kasmíra, the two countries being always mentioned together as Kasmíra-Gandhára. They occupied the sites of the modern districts of Peshawar and Rawalpindi in the northern Punjab (PHAI. p.93). In the time of Asoka the country formed part of his empire, and is mentioned as such in Rock Edict V. Before that it was subject to the Achaemenid kings. Gandhára was always famous for its red woollen shawls (kambala) (SNA.ii.487; J.vi.501).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another king of Takkasilá besides Pukkusáti is mentioned - namely, Naggaji, who was a contemporary of Nimi, king of Videha. (J.iii.377; cf. Ait. Bráhmana vii.34; Sat. Bráhmana viii.1, 4, 10; see also Gandhárarájá).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the eye teeth of the Buddha was deposited in Gandhára (Bu.xxviii.6; D.ii.167).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When his colleagues blamed him, the Buddha interceded on his behalf and suggested that he be given absolution for his offences, in view of his insanity.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gokuliká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secondary division of the Vajjiputtaká, their immediate parent-body being the Mahásanghikas. Later, from the Gokulikas, sprang two other schools - the Paññattivádins and the Báhulikas (or Bahussutikas) (Dpv.v.40; Mhv.v.4f.; Mbv., p.96). Their most important heresy seems to have been that they considered all sankháras, without qualification, no better than a heap of embers (kukkula) whence the flames have died out as from an inferno of ashes. They based this view on the Buddha's declaration made in the Adittapariyáya Sutta (&quot;All is on fire, bhikkhus&quot;) (Kvu.ii.7, p.208, and Points of Controversy, 127f). This view was probably responsible for their other name of (Kukkulikas or Kukkutikas) (Rockhill, 186ff). It may be that Kukkulika was their earlier name, of which Gokuliká was either a corruption or a derivation from the name of one of their teachers.

Godha Játaka (No.138).-The Bodhisatta was once born as a lizard and paid homage to a good ascetic living near the ant-hill where he dwelt. The good ascetic left and was replaced by a wicked one, to whom the Bodhisatta paid like homage. One day, the villagers brought a dish of lizard's flesh to the ascetic. Being attracted by its flavour, he planned to kill the Bodhisatta, that he might have more of the flesh. But the Bodhisatta discovered his intention just in time, and, making good his escape, denounced the hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a wicked monk. J.i.480f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Godha Játaka (No.141).-The Bodhisatta was born once as an iguana, leader of many others. His son became intimate with a young chameleon, whom he used to clip and embrace. The Bodhisatta warned his son against this unnatural intimacy, but, finding his advice of no avail, and knowing that danger would come to them through the chameleon, he prepared a way of escape, should the need arise. The chameleon, growing tired of the friendship with the iguana, showed a trapper the home of the iguanas. The trapper made a fire round the hole and killed many of the iguanas as they tried to escape, but the Bodhisatta reached safety through the hole he had provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told about a treacherous monk, identified with the young iguana (J.i.487f). For details see the Mahilámukha Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Godha Játaka (No.325).-The story of the past is very similar to No.1 above, except that there is only mention of one ascetic and he is a hypocrite. The young lizard threatened to expose the ascetic's hypocrisy and compelled him to leave the hermitage. The story was related in reference to a monk who was a cheat and a rogue (J.iii.84f).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Cf. the Kuhakabráhmana Vatthu (DhA.iv.154f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Godha Játaka (No.333).-A prince and his wife, returning after a long journey, were greatly distressed by hunger, and some hunters, seeing them, gave them a roasted lizard. The wife carried it in her hand, hanging it from a creeper. Arriving at a lake, they sat down at the foot of a tree, and while his wife was away fetching water the prince ate the whole lizard. When his wife came back, he told her that the lizard had run away, leaving only the tail in his hand. Later, the prince became king, but his wife, though appointed queen consort, received no real honour. The Bodhisatta, who was the king's minister, wishing to see justice done to the queen, contrived that the king should be reminded of his ingratitude by allusion being made to the incident of the roast lizard. The king thereupon realised his neglect of his dutiful wife, and conferred on her supreme power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a couple who had been given a roast lizard, when returning from a journey undertaken to collect debts. The husband ate the whole lizard when his wife was away. She said nothing and drank some water to appease her hunger, but when they visited the Buddha, and be asked her if her husband were good and affectionate, she replied in the negative. The Buddha then told her the story of the past. J.iii.106f.; cf. Succaja Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ghositáráma&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Kosambí, built by Ghosita (Ghosaka, q.v.) for the use of the Buddha and the monks. The Buddha often stayed there during his visits to Kosambí and numerous incidents are mentioned in the books in connection with the monastery. It was because of a dispute between two monks of the Ghositáráma, one expert in the Vinaya and one in the Dhamma, that the first schism arose in the Order, driving the Buddha himself to seek quiet in the Párileyyaka forest. Vin.i.337f; M.i.320; DhA.i.44ff; the Kosambí monks were evidently somewhat peculiar (see Vin.iv.197).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even at other times the Buddha seems to have sought solitude in this forest during his sojourns at the Ghositáráma (See, e.g., S.iii.96f). It was here that the Buddha decreed the ukkhepaniyakamma for Channa, who refused to acknowledge and atone for his offences (Vin.ii.21f), and here that he laid down the procedure in that connection to be followed. Devadatta was at Ghositáráma when he first conceived the idea of using Ajátasattu for his own ends (Vin.ii.184f). The Buddha was there at the time and it is said that the devaputta Kakudha appeared before Mahá-Moggallána to warn him of Devadatta's schemes. The information was reported to the Buddha, who warned Moggallána not to pass it on to others. The Buddha then proceeded to tell Moggallána of the five kinds of teachers which appear in the world (A.iii.122f). Ananda is several times spoken of as staying in the Ghositáráma, sometimes with the Buddha, sometimes alone. On one such occasion he asks the Buddha why women should suffer from certain disabilities as compared with men (A.ii.82). And again (A.iii.132f), what are the circumstances which conduce to ease (phásuvihára) in the case of monks? Could it be said of a follower of the Buddha that his </data>
<data>attainments depend on the length of time during which he has observed the Buddha's teachings? Once Ananda visits (A.iv.37f), at her request, a nun living near by reported to be ill and enamoured of him. The mere sight of him causes her recovery, but he preaches to her on the impermanent nature of the body and makes her realise the truth (A.ii.144f). Among those who visit Ananda at the Ghositáráma and discuss various matters with him are mentioned: Ghosita (S.iv.113), Unnábha (S.v.271f.), a householder, follower of the Ajivikas (A.i.217f.), and Bhaddaji (A.iii.202). Udáyí twice visits him there, once to ask for a description of consciousness (S.iv.169f.), and again to quote a verse uttered by Pañcálacanda devaputta and to ask Ananda to explain it (A.iv.449). We find him also joining in a discussion which ensued on a sermon to the monks by Ananda (A.iv.426f.). Udáyí preached to large audiences at the Ghositáráma and was evidently appreciated, for we find Ananda reporting it to the Buddha and being told that it is no easy matter to preach to a large assembly with acceptance (A.iii.184f.). The Yuganaddha Sutta is a discourse preached by Ananda to the monks at the Ghositáráma of his own accord (A.ii.156f.). Channa is several times mentioned in connection with incidents taking place at the Ghositáráma. Mention has already been made of the ukkhepa-niyakamma declared on him. A devoted householder, wishing to build a vihára for him, asked him for a site. Vin.iii.155f; mention is made of other misdemeanours which he committed in order to have a fine vihára (Vin.iv.47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channa started cutting down trees and other things, in order to clear the site, and this led to great uproar. On another occasion he is reported to the Buddha for refusing to listen to his colleagues and the Buddha chides him (Vin.iii.77, also iv.35f, 113. See also S.iii.132f). It was when Channa was at the Ghositáráma that Ananda came, at the </data>
<data>bidding of the monks, to inflict on him the brahmadanda (Vin.ii.292).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among others mentioned as staying at the Ghositáráma are Músila, Savittha, Nárada, in the company of Ananda (S.ii.115), Pindola Bháradvája - who converts Udena when the latter comes to see him (S.iv.110f.) and earns the Buddha's praises for his attainments (S.v.224) - Sáriputta and Upavána (S.v.76), and Báhiya and Anuruddha (A.ii.239). Anuruddha is there at the time of the schism of the Kosambí monks but refuses to intervene. He indulges, instead, in his powers of clairvoyance and mention is made of a visit paid to him by the Manápakáyika-devas (A.iv.262f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dásaka and a number of other monks were once staying in the Ghositáráma; on learning that Khemaka lies ill in the Badarikáráma, one gávuta away, the others send Dásaka several times to and fro to ask various questions of Khemaka. In the end, Khemaka himself comes to them to solve their difficulties (S.iii.126f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Kosambiya Sutta, Jáliya Sutta, Sandaka Sutta, Upakkilesa Sutta and Sekha Sutta, Dalhadhamma Játaka, Kosambí Játaka and Suripána Játaka, all preached while the Buddha was staying at the Ghositáráma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty thousand monks from the Ghositáráma, under the leadership of Urudhammarakkhita, were present at the foundation of the Mahá Thúpa at Anurádhapura.

A householder, in a village near Sávatthi, built a vihára for a monk who visited his house. Other monks arrived, and the incumbent, envious of them, spoke ill of them to the householder who abused them all. As a result, he was born a peta in the cesspit of the same monastery and came under the notice of Mahá Moggallána. Pv.iv.18; PvA.266f; cp. ThagA.i.386f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

Gelañña Sutta.-The Buddha, staying at the Kútágárasálá in Vesáli, visits the sick ward in the evening and talks to the sick monks. A monk, he tells them, should meet his end collected and composed. He should put away the dejection arising from craving. In whatever he does, he should act composedly. So composed and collected, he becomes free from bondage. When his body breaks up, he understands the matter and is prepared for it, for it is like a lamp which goes out when oil and wick are exhausted. S.iv.210f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gelañña Sutta.-The topic is the same as in the above, but the wording differs. S.iv.213f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gayá-Kassapa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the three Kassapa brothers, the Tebhátika-Jatilá (q.v.). On leaving the world with his brothers and becoming an ascetic, he gathered round him a company of two hundred other ascetics. They all lived at Gayásísa, hence his name (Gayásíse pabbajito ti Gayá Kassapo náma játo). When Uruvela-Kassapa was converted, Gayá-Kassapa, with his followers, joined the Order, and at the conclusion of the Adittapariyáya Sutta they all became arahants (Vin.i.33f.; AA.i.165). Gayá-Kassapa is reported (Thag.v.345f) to have said that he used to bathe three times a day at Gayátittha, in order to wash away his sins during the festival of Gayáphaggu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhí Buddha he was a householder, and later became a forest-dwelling hermit. One day he saw the Buddha walking alone in the forest and offered him a kola-fruit (ThagA.i.417f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Koladáyaka of the Apadána.

The Buddha describes to the monks some of the stages through which he passed before reaching Enlightenment. At first he could only sec the light from the bodies of the devas; later, through conscious striving, he could distinguish their forms, talk with them, discover how they came to be born in their different spheres; then he was able to read their past births, and at last he attained to supreme knowledge.

Once the king, on his way from Anurádhapura to Cetiyapabbata, came to the Kadamba river and found that his horse would not cross it. When the trainer was blamed, he explained that the horse did not wish to have his tail wet, in case the king's dress should be spoilt. The king held up the horse's tail, and he immediately crossed the stream (MA.ii.653f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to illustrate the good qualities of a well-trained horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

An elephant who came up smelt the dung and went away in disgust. The beetle, thinking the elephant was frightened of him, called after him and challenged him to a fight. The elephant returned, dropped some dung on him and, making water over him, killed him on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who quelled the pride of a rowdy; the latter used to molest monks who went for alms to a village near Jetavana, asking them questions and insulting them so much that the monks were reluctant to go there. One day a monk, stronger than the rest, enticed the man out of the village, felled him with one blow, and threatened to teach him another lesson if he did not cease pestering the monks. After that the man decamped at the sight of a monk. J.ii.209ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Godatta Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-He belonged to a family of caravan-leaders and, on the death of his father, travelled about himself with five hundred carts, engaged in trade. One day, one of his oxen fell on the road, and seeing that his men could not get it up, Godatta went up and smote it. The ox, incensed by this cruelty, assumed a human voice and, chiding him for his base ingratitude, cursed him. Godatta, much moved, renounced all his property and joined the Order, in due course attaining arahantship (ThagA.i.555f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá (vs.659-72) contains several stanzas attributed to him, wherein he discoursed to &quot;Ariyan&quot; groups, both lay and religious, on lokadhammá (the nature of things?), illustrating his meaning with a wealth of simile. He is probably the Godatta of the Godatta Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Godatta Thera&lt;/b&gt;.-His full name was Abhidhammika Godatta, showing that he was considered expert in Abhidhamma. He was evidently a well-known Abhidhamma commentator and is quoted in the Visuddhi Magga (p.138), but it is said that his explanation was rejected in the Commentaries because it was only the Elder's personal view.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samantapásádika (ii.307, also 478; iii.588), however, relates a story showing that the Elder was recognised as an authority on the Vinaya. A monk of Antarasamudda made a drinking bowl out of a coco-nut shell and, leaving it in the monastery, went to Cetiyagiri. Another monk, fancying the bowl, stole it and also went to Cetiyagiri, where he met the owner and was charged with theft. Unable to settle the dispute where they were, they went to the Mahávihára. There, by beating of drums, the monks were assembled near the Mahácetiya, and convicted the accused </data>
<data>of theft, holding him guilty of a párájiká offence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Godatta, being interviewed, pointed out that the value of the bowl was only a penny or two and that the Buddha had nowhere laid down that the theft of such an insignificant object could be held a párájiká offence. His decision was greeted with applause, and when the report thereof reached the reigning king, Bhátiya, he decreed that, henceforth, in all their disputes, his subjects should abide by the decision of Godatta. v.l. Godha, Godhaka, Goda, Gotta, Godanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Godatta Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An incumbent of Kalyáni-mahávihára in Ceylon. He would procure his food when the shadow of the sun was two inches long and eat it when it was but one inch. Even when no sun was to be seen, he knew the time exactly. The people discovered this by watching him and set their &quot;clocks&quot; by his movements. MA.i.100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sáriputta proceeds to talk to the other monks of the duties of a bhikkhu who, coming from the wilds, starts to live in the confraternity; he should show respect and consideration to others, be correct in the matter of seats, observe certain rules in begging for alms, and keep watch over his faculties while studying the higher Dhamma and Vinaya. Moggallána asks whether these duties are incumbent only on those monks who come from the wilds, and is told that they are still more so on monks living in villages.

Gothakábhaya, Gothábhaya.-A king of the Rohana dynasty; son of Yatthálayakatissa and father of Kákavannatissa (Mhv.xv.170; xxii.11). He is sometimes called Abhaya. E.g., Mhv.xxiii.10, 56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gothakábhaya.-King of Ceylon (302-15 A.C.). He was a Lambakanna of Mahiyangana, and having gone to Anurádhapura with Sanghatissa and Sanghabodhi, he, with their help, slew the reigning king, Vijaya, and they reigned in succession (Mhv.xxxvi.58). Gothakábhaya became Sanghabodhi's treasurer but, seeing the king's weakness, he led a rebellion against him and captured the throne (vv.91, 98-117; for details see Sanghabodhi). In addition to other religious works, he built the Meghavannábhaya-Vihára. He banished from Abhayagiri sixty monks who had accepted the Vetulla heresy, but a Cola monk, Sanghamitta, defeated in discussion the thera Gothábhaya, the king's uncle, and became the king's favourite, obtaining the position of tutor to the king's two sons, Jetthatissa and Mahásena. The king was also known as Meghavannábhaya (v.98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Gotama Thera.-He belonged to a brahmin family of Rájagaha and was initiated at the age of seven. When he was seventeen, he fell into bad company, gave all he had to a courtesan and broke his vow of celibacy. He was then filled with remorse at the thought of what he had done, but the Buddha appeared before him and he entered the Order, becoming an arahant in the tonsure-hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been a householder in the time of Vipassí Buddha and had given to the Buddha an ámoda-fruit (Thag.137f.; ThagA.i.256f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Amodaphaliya of the Apadána. Ap.ii.447.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gotama Thera. He belonged to the Sákiyan clan and came to be known only by his gotta-name. He entered the Order when the Buddha visited his kinsfolk and, in due course, became an arahant. In the time of Sikhí Buddha he had offered eight campaka-flowers at the Buddha's thúpa (Thag.258-60; ThagA.i.374f). He is evidently identical with Citapújaka of the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apadána. Ap.ii.407.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gotama Thera.-Also called Aparagotama. He was older than the Buddha and belonged to an Udicca-brahmin family of Sávatthi. He was learned in the Vedas and was an unrivalled orator. When the Buddha came to Sávatthi for the dedication of Jetavana, he heard the Buddha preach and entered the Order, attaining arahantship in the tonsure-hall. When he returned to Sávatthi, after a long residence in the Kosala country, many of his relations, eminent brahmins, came to him and counselled him as to the various gospels (suddhivádá) current among the people; he told them of the Buddha's teaching. Thag.587-96; ThagA.i.529f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Gotama Thera.-An arahant, living in Piyangudípa. He was the teacher of Dutthagámani (Mhv.xx.69). When the latter, </data>
<data>during his flight from his brother, wished to give alms to a monk before eating, Gotama knew his desire and sent a monk named Tissa to accept the alms. When the food was brought to Piyangudípa, Gotama offered morsels of it to five hundred monks (twelve thousand, according to Mhv.xxxii.65) and, refilling the bowl with scraps of food, sent it back by air to the prince (Mhv.xxiv.24, 30; MT.465).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Gotama.-The name of the clan to which the Buddha and the Sákiyans belonged. The members of the clan, though khattiyas, claimed descent from a brahmin isi, Gotama (For an explanation of this see Thomas, op. cit., 22f). Gotama and Angiras are both enumerated in the Pravara ceremony as the ancestors of the Gotama clan (Asvaláyana, Srauta-sútra, 12, 11, 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late Buddhists appear to have forgotten the Vedic rsi, for, according to an ancient legend, Okkáka, the immediate ancestor of the Sákiyans, was born of an egg formed of the coagulated blood and semen of an ascetic Gotama, as he lay impaled for the alleged murder of a courtesan. The egg was hatched by the sun (Mtu.i.338ff; Rockhill, Buddha, 9f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama is the name by which the Buddha is addressed by brahmins and others who are not his followers. In one place, at least, the Buddha is represented as addressing the Sákiyans as &quot;Gotamá.&quot; (S.iv.183). The Gotama-gotta is classed among the higher gottas, together with such gottas as Moggallána, Kaccáyana and Vásettha (Vin.iv.6; DA.i.246f, uccákula-paridípanam). According to the Theragáthá Commentary (ii.204; also AA.i.395; Gotama-buddhassa sávako pi Gotamo), the Buddha's disciples (e.g., in the case of Vangisa) were also called Gotama, even when they did not naturally belong to that clan. See also Sakyá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Gotama.-A brahmin sage, his full name being Angirasa Gotama. See Angirasa (7).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Gotama.-The name of the brahmin chaplain in the Bhikkháparampara Játaka. The scholiast adds that it was his gotta-name (J.iv.371, 372).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Gotama.-A mountain near Himavá (Ap.i.162).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Gotama.-A thera in Ceylon who wrote a Sinhalese paraphrase to the Sambandhacintá. He belonged to the Araññavásí sect and was a pupil of Vanaratana Ananda (P.L.C.199, 220).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Gotama.-See Álavi-Gotama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gotama')"&gt;11. Gotama.-The last of the twenty-five Buddhas.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

S.iv.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Gilána Sutta.-The Buddha visits Mahá Kassapa lying ill in the Pippalíguhá, and talks to him of the seven bojjhangas. Delighted with the talk, Kassapa recovers. S.v.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Gilána Sutta.-Describes a similar visit to Mahá Moggallána at Gijjhakúta. S.iv.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Gilána Sutta.-The Buddha lies ill in the Kalandakanivápa in Veluvana; Mahá Cunda visits him, and they talk of the seven bojjhangas. The Buddha immediately recovers. S.v.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Gilána Sutta.-Once, shortly before his death, the Buddha spent the rainy season in Beluva, where he became </data>
<data>seriously ill. By great effort of will he overcame the sickness. Ananda expresses his admiration for the Buddha's strength of mind, but adds his conviction that the Buddha would not die without having made some pronouncement concerning the Order. Then follows the Buddha's famous injunction to his followers that they should take no other guide or refuge but the Dhamma and their own selves. S.v.152f.; the sutta is found almost verbatim in D.ii.98f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Gilána Sutta.-The Buddha visits the sick ward in the Kútágárasála in Vesáli and talks to a sick monk, telling him that by practising five things during illness one can be sure of the speedy destruction of the ásavas, these things being asubhánupassaná, áhárepatikúlasaññá, sabba-loke anabhiratasaññá, sabbasankháresu aniccánupassaná and marana-saññá.

Does deva-dhammiká in Ap.ii.358 (vs.11) qualify Gotamá?) Rhys Davids thinks they were almost certainly the followers of some other member of the Sákiyan clan, as distinct from the Buddha, and suggests that it might have been Devadatta or possibly a brahmin of the Gotamagotta. (Dial.i.222; but see his article on Buddhist Law in ERE.; see also Brethren 265, n.3). The Lalita-vistara (p.492), however, speaks of the Gautamas in a list of nine such sects; the Gotamakas and the Gautamas are evidently identical, as several of the other classes correspond with the Páli. According to the Lalita-vistara, these sects existed even before the Buddha, for they are represented as meeting and addressing him in the sixth week after the Enlightenment, on his way to the Ajapála-tree. We hear no more of them in subsequent history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gotamaka.-A yakkba. See Gotamakacetiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.

Dutthagámaní lived there before being crowned at Mahágáma (Mhv.xxiv.17). Guttasála was thirty to thirty-five miles to the north of Mahágáma, where the high road crossed the Mánikagañga, and lay on the main route which spread from Mahágáma to Mutiyangana, and from there along the Maháválukagangá to Pulatthipura; hence its strategic importance. It was the centre of several campaigns at different periods. (E.g., of Mahinda, Cv.li.109, 117; Vijayabáhu I., Cv.lxviii.34; Jayabáhu I., Cv.lxi.12; Parakkamabáhu I., Cv.lxxiv.165f.; lxxv.15. See Cv.Trs.i.158, n.4). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atthasáliní (DhsA.398f) records the story of a nun of Guttasála; she was an arahant, and when the village was destroyed by bandits she left it with a young nun carrying her baggage. At the village gate of Nakulanagara she met Mahánága of Kálavallimandapa, who offered her a meal in his own bowl, as she had none of her own. She ate the meal, washed the bowl and returned it, telling him that from the next day he would get alms without exertion; and so he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It is crowned with a tableland, is green in colour (muggavanna), and covered with various medicinal plants. It shines from afar &quot;like a glowing fire on a new-moon night.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the range is an inclined slope (pabbhára) named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandamulapabbhara')"&gt;Nandamúlaka&lt;/a&gt; containing three caves, Suvanna-, Mani- and Rajata-guhá, which are the abodes of Pacceka Buddhas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the entrance to Maniguhá is a tree named Mañjúsaka, one league in height and in girth; on this tree bloom all the flowers that grow both on land and in water, and especially do they bloom on the occasions of the Pacceka Buddhas' visits; round the tree is the Sabbara-tanamála.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There the Sammajjanakaváta sweeps the ground, the Samakaranaváta levels the sand, and the Siñcanakaváta sprinkles water from Anotatta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sugandhakaranaváta brings all the perfumes of Himavá, the Ocinakaváta plucks flowers, and the Santharanakaváta spreads them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mála seats are always ready for the Pacceka Buddhas, who on fast days and on their own birthdays assemble there. When a new Pacceka Buddha arises in the world, he goes first to Gandha-mádana and other Pacceka Buddhas, who may be in the world, assemble there to greet him, and they all sit rapt in </data>
<data>samádhi. Then the senior among them asks the new-comer to describe how he came to be a Pacceka Buddha (SNA.i.52, 66f; ii.437; AA.ii.759; UdA.300, etc.; MA.ii.585).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pacceka Buddhas who live on Gandhamádana will often enter into samádhi for seven days, and at the end of that period seek alms from someone on whom they wish to bestow a special favour, that he may thereby obtain merit (E.g., DhA.iii.368f; iv.121, 199f; J.iv.16). These Buddhas will sometimes leave the mountain, and, having admonished those whom they wish to help, return again (E.g., J.iii.453).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Pacceka Buddhas, others are also mentioned as having resided in Gandhamádana - e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naarada')"&gt;Nárada&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.393), &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/n1_nan')"&gt;Naliniká&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.186), &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/b')"&gt;Bahusodarí&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.83); also the deva king &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagadatta')"&gt;Nágadatta&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.138), and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara')"&gt;Vessantara&lt;/a&gt;, with his family, after he renounced his kingdom (J.vi.528f.). It is also said that Kinnaras (J.iv.438) and Nágas (Rockhill, 169) lived on the slopes of Gandhamádana. It was among the places visited by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata')"&gt;Khadira-vaniya Revata&lt;/a&gt; (AA.i.139).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not explicitly mentioned that all Pacceka Buddhas die in Gandhamádana, but the inference seems to be such. Thus, once, five hundred Pacceka Buddhas led by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapaduma')"&gt;Mahápaduma&lt;/a&gt; died there, and their bodies were cremated (ThagA.ii.141).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka Commentary (vi.79) explains Gandhamádana as gandhena mada-karo pabbato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fragrant tree Bhujaka grows only in heaven and in Gandhamádana (VvA.162).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the Buddha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metteyya')"&gt;Metteya&lt;/a&gt; will </data>

The Nága king of the lake, Canda, enraged by the dropping of the birds' dung into the water, caused flames to dart up from the water to the tree, and the Bodhisatta, perceiving the danger, flew away with his flock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk whose but was burnt by fire. The villagers undertook to build him another, but there was a delay of three months, during which the monk with no shelter could not proceed in his meditation. The Buddha chided him for not seeking another shelter. J.i.471f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gangá &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gangá (Modern Ganges).-One of the five great rivers (Mahánadí) that water Jambudípa, the others being Yamuná, Aciravatí, Sarabhú, and Mahí (E.g., Vin.ii.237; S.ii.135; v.401; A.iv.101; v.22; Mil.114 mentions ten). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., SNA.ii.438f; AA.ii.761ff; MA.ii.586; UdA.301) give a long description of their origin. From the Anotatta lake flow four rivers: that from the south circles the lake three times under the name of Avattagangá, then as Kanhagangá flows straight for sixty leagues along the surface of a rock, comes into violent contact with a vertical rock, and is thrown upwards as a column of water three gávutas in circumference; this column, known as Akásagangá, flows through the air for sixty leagues, falls on to the rock Tiyaggala, excavating it to a depth of fifty leagues, thus forming a lake which is called Tiyaggalapokkharaní; then the river, under the name of Bahalagangá, flows through a chasm in the rock for sixty leagues, then, under the name of Ummaggagangá, through a tunnel for a further sixty leagues, and finally coming upon the oblique rock Vijjha, divides into five streams, forming the five rivers above mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among places mentioned as being on the banks of the Gangá are Benáres, Campá, Ayojjha, Kimbhilá, Ukkávelá, Payága, Pátaliputta, and Sankassa. The Gangá formed one of the most important means of communication and trade for the districts through which it flowed - e.g., from Rájagaha to Vesáli. The district to the north of the river and bordering on the kingdom of Anga was called Anguttarápa (SNA.ii.439). The river was five hundred leagues in length (SA.ii.119).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the Gangá appears again and </data>
<data>again in similes and metaphors in the Páli books: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;its sands are immeasurable (S.iv.376);  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;its waters cannot be made bracken by   adding to them a grain of salt (A.i.250); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;it is full of foam, and yet its foam   is empty (S.iii.140); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;it were folly to wish to hold up the   course of its waters with one's fist (S.iv.298); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;as the river finds repose only in the   ocean, so do the followers of the Buddha find repose only in nibbána   (M.i.493);&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;some things are as inevitable as that   the Gangá should flow into the sea (S.iv.179); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;there is no such thing as the Gangá   apart from its sand, its water, and its banks; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;to be cast on the other side of the   Gangá (páragangáya) is great misfortune (see, e.g., S.i.207, SnA.i.228).  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Gangá flows from west to east (pácínaninná,   S.iv.191); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;during the rains it is so full of   water that even a crow could drink water from its bank (Vin.i.230);   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;sometimes the banks would be flooded   and the buildings on them destroyed (SA.i.164), and people would find   difficulty in crossing; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;at others it was shallow and could be   crossed by means of a reed bridge (SnA.i.18); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;cattle could easily be driven from one   bank to another (M.i.225). &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At various spots were ferries where   boatmen plied for hire (e.g., J.iii.230). &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On its banks, on the higher reaches,   were numerous snakes and parrots (J.ii.145, iii.491), &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;and all along the banks were   hermitages (e.g., J.iii.476, v.191, etc.). &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Men always bathed in the river, and on   festival days even women of very good family came for water-sports, sometimes   spending the whole day in the river; kings also came with their retinues   (e.g., J.i.295; MA.ii.604; DhA.iii.199). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference is also made to a Gangámahíkílá, (Smp. on Vin.i.191, and again, ii.276). Buddhaghosa says that Mahí here refers to the earth, but Rhys Davids (VT.ii.25, n.3) thinks it refers to the river of that name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The junction of the Gangá and the Yamuná is frequently referred to, and is used as a simile for perfect union (e.g., J.vi.412, 415). A tributary of the Gangá is mentioned which flows from Himavá, its name being Migasammatá (J.vi.72). The ford at Pátaliputta, where the Buddha crossed on his way from Rájagaha to Vesáli, was called Gotamatittha (Vin.i.230); its distance from Rájagaha was five leagues, and from Vesáli three (KhpA.162-3). When the Buddha, after curing the plague at Vesáli, returned to Rájagaha, great festivities marked the event, and the celebration was known as the Gangárohana. The devas and the nágas vied with each other to do honour to the Teacher, and there was a great assembly of all classes of beings, comparable to those on the occasions of the Twin Miracle and the Descent from Tusita (DhA.iii.444). Among the nágas who dwelt in the Gangá is mentioned Eraka (DhA.iii.231).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water of the Gangá was considered holy and was used for the consecration of kings, not only of India but also of Ceylon (Mhv.xi.30; MT.305).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people on the northern bank were rough and coarse, while those on the south were pious and generous, believers in the Buddha (DA.i.160).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The upper reaches of the river were called Uddhagangá (J.ii.283, vi.427) or Uparigangá (J.iv.230), and the lower reaches Adhogangá (J.ii.283, 329, v.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Kosikí, Bhagírathí, Mahágangá, and Páragangá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gangá.-See Maháválukagangá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gangá.-A lake, the residence of the Nága king Dona. BuA.153.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The subject of his talk was consummate energy (áraddhaviriya). Sáriputta declares that, in comparison with Moggallána, he himself is like a mound of gravel set up alongside the Himálaya. Moggallána returns the compliment by saying that, beside Sáriputta, he is like a pinch of salt set up alongside a large jar of salt, and recalls the high praise bestowed on Sáriputta by the Buddha himself.

One day the Gandhára king saw an eclipse of the moon and, being stirred in his mind, left his kingdom and became an ascetic in Himavá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Videha king, hearing of this, did likewise. They met in Himavá, but failed to recognise each other until, seeing another eclipse of the moon, they exchanged reminiscences. They went out begging together, and the Videha ascetic, having once been given a large quantity of salt, stored up some of it for a saltless day. The Gandhára ascetic, finding this out, blamed his friend for his greediness, and the latter begged his forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Videha ascetic is identified with Ananda. The story was told in reference to the occasion of the passing of the rule forbidding monks to store medicine for more than seven days. J.iii.363ff; the introductory story is given in Vin.i.206ff; see also Pilindavaccha; the Játaka story is given in MA.i.534f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Noticing that the king was slothful, the Bodhisatta took a tortoise as an object lesson, showing him how the indolent came to misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who was slothful regarding his duties.

The king, awakening, went in search of them, and was angry when he discovered their where-abouts. He questioned Pindola as to the solitude which he professed to seek in the park, but Pindola refusing to answer, the king threatened to set red ants at him. Thereupon Pindola went through the air to the Buddha's &lt;a href="gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt; and related the story. The Buddha was reclining on his bed and, in that position, preached this sutta to the Elder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man who clings to the body and to the pleasures of the senses, lives in constant fear. One should therefore cast off greed and cross the flood, unstained by the world (SN.vv.772-9; SNA.ii.514ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta probably derives its name from the fact that, in the first verse, the body is spoken of as a guhá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is commented on in the Mahá Niddesa pp.23ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

But Vanka was seized by a burning sensation, and he ordered the release of Ghata and the restoration of his kingdom. J.iii.168f; cf. Ekarája.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

When a son of his brother, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasudeva')"&gt;Vásudeva&lt;/a&gt;, died, Vásudeva lamented beyond all measure, and Ghata, wishing to cure him, feigned madness and went about Dváravatí asking for the hare in the moon. When Vásudeva heard of this from his courtier Rohineyya, he hastened to Ghata and argued with him about the ridiculousness of his quest. The plan succeeded and Vásudeva was cured of his grief.

Godávari).-A river in Dakkhinápatha, of which it forms the southern boundary. During the Buddha's time, the Alaka (or Mulaka) king and the Assaka king (both Andhakas) had settlements on its northern bank, and Bávarí's hermitage lay in the territory between their dominions (SN.vs.977). The Commeutary (SNA.ii.581) says that near this spot the Godhávarí divided into two branches, forming an island three leagues in extent, and the island was a dense forest, known as the Kapitthavana. Bávarí's hermitage occupied a region of five leagues. In the past this region had been the abode of various sages, such as Sarabhanga (J.v.132, 136; Mtu.i.363). According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.182), Bávarí's hermitage was on a bend of the river (Godhávarívanke). The Godhávarí is one of the holiest rivers in Southern India, rising in Brahmagiri near the village of Triyanvaka and sanctified by its connection with Ráma and various saints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

Carpets were laid from the Kadambanadí to the mountain, in order that people might approach the mountain with clean feet; the road was decorated and illuminated, shops were erected and largesse distributed. There were mimes, songs and music. Lamps were lit throughout the island and even on the sea for one yojana round (Mhv.xxxiv.75ff; AA.i.13). It is said (Vsm.376; Vsm.Trs.ii.436, n.4) that on the day of the festival Mára, wishing to spoil it, rained down a shower of coal, but an Elder created earth in the sky, thus preventing the coal from falling. The most costly offerings given during this feast to any monk - namely, a pair of garments - fell to the lot of a young novice, Lonagirivásí Tissa, in spite of the efforts of the king's ministers to get them into the hands of the older monks. It was because the novice had practised the sáráníya-dhammá (DA.ii.535; AA.ii.653f; MA.i.545f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The festival was probably connected with the Giribhanda-vihára, in which case that was the reason for the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha ate it immediately, and gave the seed to Ananda to be planted by the gardener at the city-gate. A tree of one hundred cubits sprouted forth at once, covered with fruit and flowers. At the foot of this tree Vissakamma, by the order of Sakka, built a pavilion of the seven kinds of precious things. J.iv.264f; J.i.88; DhA.iii.206ff; Mil.349.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day during their travels father and son were obliged to take lodging in a hall haunted by a yakkha. In the case of persons occupying this hall, if one of them should happen to sneeze and the other failed, thereupon, to wish him long life, the yakkha was allowed to eat them. This boon had been granted him in return for twelve years' services to Vessavana. The two travellers from Kási took up their abode in the hall for one night, during which the father sneezed. The son, knowing nothing of his danger, said nothing, but on seeing the yakkha preparing to eat him, he guessed the reason and hastened to wish his father long life. The father acted likewise, and the yakkha was foiled in his attempt on their lives. The Bodhisatta, having heard the yakkha's story, established him in the five precepts. The story became known, and the Bodhisatta was given the post of general, while the yakkha was made tax-gatherer. In the story the Bodhisatta addresses his father as Gagga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when the Buddha was preaching, he sneezed, and all around him shouted &quot;Long Life,&quot; thus interrupting his sermon. The Buddha told them that the custom was superstitious, and forbade them to follow it. On their obeying him, the common people blamed them for their lack of good manners. The Buddha, thereupon, withdrew the injunction and related this story to account for the origin of the custom. (J.ii.15f.; the introductory story is found in Vin.ii.140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gagga is identified with Mahá Kassapa. J.ii.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ghatíkára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the great Brahmá. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a potter of Vehalinga, looking after his blind parents. He was a very pious and devoted follower of the Buddha, ministering to him better than anyone else, and the Buddha accepted his invitation in preference to that of the king of Benares. It is said that when the Buddha was in need of anything he would go to Ghatíkára's house and take it, whether he were at home or not, so great was his confidence in Ghatíkára's piety. Once, when Ghatíkára was absent, the people, at the Buddha's suggestion, took away the thatch from his house to roof the hut of Tathágata. For three months Ghatíkára's house remained open to the sky, but no rain fell on it, so great was his faith (Mil.223f). According to the Nalapána Játaka (J.i.172), no rain will ever fall on the site of Ghatíkára's' house as long as this kappa lasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, who at the time of Ghatíkára was a young brahmin named Jotipála, was the friend of Ghatíkára but had no faith in the Buddha, and Ghatíkára, having failed to persuade him to visit the Buddha, in the end took him by force. Jotipála was converted and joined the Order, but Ghatíkára, as the only support of his parents, could not renounce the world. Kikí, king of Benares, having heard of his virtues from Kassapa Buddha, sent him five hundred cartloads of the choicest rice, etc., but Ghatíkára returned the gifts, saying that he had plenty for himself (M.ii.46ff; S.i.35f; Bu.xxv.41; SnA.i.152).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death, Ghatíkára was born as a Mahábrahmá in the Avihá Brahma-world, and an anágámí. He was evidently already a Sakadágámi before his death (see DhA.i.380), but he did not wish his attainments to be known (AA.i.44).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;He provided the Buddha with the eight requisites of a monk when the Buddha, having left the world, decided to lead the life of a bhikkhu (J.i.65; SnA.ii.382; BuA.236; VvA.314). The begging bowl, then provided by him, vanished when the Buddha was given a bowl of milk rice by Sujátá (J.i.69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.35f; 60), Ghatíkára visited the Buddha some time after the Enlightenment and the Buddha reminded him of their former friendship. Ghatíkára, on that occasion, speaks of several others (besides Jotipála) who had been his friends in Vehalinga - Upaka, Phalaganda, Pukkusáti, Bhaddiya, Khandadeva, Báhuraggi and Pingiya. They had listened to the Buddha's teaching and, after death, were born in the Avihá-world, where he himself was. In this context the Buddha addresses him as Bhaggava (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Gajabáhu, Gajabhuja&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (1137-1153). He was the son of Vikkamabáhu II. and succeeded his father to the throne (Cv.lx.88, according to the Dimbulágala Inscription, his mother was Sundarí). Thus he was the grandson of Vijayabáhu I and of Tilokasundarí, and came, therefore, of Kálinga stock. When he saw the increasing power of the Prince Parakkamabáhu (afterwards Parakkamabáhu I.), Gajabáhu sent for him with many marks of favour and welcomed him at his court. In order to win the king's confidence Parakkama gave his sister Bhaddavati to be his queen, but when he saw that Gajabáhu was becoming suspicious of his power he left Pulatthipura and made preparations to wage war against him. In the campaign that followed, Gajabáhu suffered many reverses and, in the end, fell into the hands of Parakkama's forces. With great difficulty Parakkama saved him from death, but in the meantime Mánábharana managed to get Gajabáhu into his power and cast him into a dungeon. From there he was rescued by Parakkamabáhu and fled to Kotthasára. Meanwhile, Parakkamabáhu had consolidated his power, and his officers captured Pulatthipura. Gajabáhu, being able to see no other help, implored the monks of Pulatthipura to intercede on his behalf, and, at their request, Parakkamabáhu left to Gajabáhu the enjoyment of his possessions. (This is rather odd, especially in view of the fact that he invited heretical nobles to come to Ceylon, Cv.lxx.53). Gajabáhu took up his abode at Gangátaláka and spent his last days there in comparative peace. As he had no heir and no brothers, he bequeathed his kingdom to Parakkamabáhu, and engraved his will on a stone tablet at Mandalagiri Vihára. He was cremated at Kotthasára. (Details of Gajabáhu's reign and his fights with Parakkamabáhu are contained in the Cúlavamsa, particularly in chapters 63, 66, </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Giraggasamajjá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A festival held from time to time (kálánukálam) in Rájagaha. (Perhaps elsewhere as well. The BuA. p.102 says it was an annual festival held all over Jambudípa and was as old as Dípankara Buddha; see also J.iii.538). It was held in the open air in the afternoon and was attended by all people of all grades of society from Anga and Magadha. Special seats were prepared for the more eminent of the audience, and the festivities seem to have consisted chiefly of nautch dances (SNA.i.326). According to the Vinaya accounts (Vin.ii.107f, 150; iv.85, 267) there were also singing and music, and the festival was attended not only by laymen, but also by members of religious orders, for otherwise it is unlikely that the Sattarasavaggiyas and the Chabbaggiyas would have been there. Food was provided as well as amusements. Buddhaghosa (Sp.iv.831) explains the name of the festival thus: giraggasamajjo ti girimhi aggasamajjo girissa vá aggadese sammajo, and tells us that it was announced for seven days before its commencement, and was held on level ground under a shadow of a hill and outside the city. Perhaps it was originally a pagan religious festival, a survival of old exogamic communistic dancing (See Dial.i.7, n.4; VT.iii.71, n.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at a Giraggasamajjá that Sáriputta and Moggallána decided to leave the world (DhA.i.73f.; AA.i.89, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit equivalent is Girivaggu-samágama.

When the dog grew up, it used to accompany the herdsman on a visit to a Pacceka Buddha, who had meals in his house. Sometimes, when the herdsman was unable to go himself, be would send the dog to summon the Pacceka Buddha. The road led through a forest and the dog would bark aloud to frighten away the wild beasts. One day, when the Pacceka Buddha went elsewhere, the dog died of a broken heart and was reborn in Távatimsa as the god Ghosa or Ghosaka.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was later reborn as Ghosaka-setthi.

It was considered one of the beautiful spots of that town (E.g., D.ii.102, 118) and the Buddha stayed there several times, particularly during the first years of his ministry (Thus AA.i.457). During one such stay, he laid down the rule which allowed monks the use of three robes; he himself felt cold during the night and had to wear extra clothing (Vin.i.288; iii.195).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shrine was pre-Buddhistic and dedicated to a Yakkha named Gotamaka. A vihára was later built on the spot for the Buddha and his monks (UdA.322; DhA.iii.246; AA.i.457; SNA.i.344). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There the Gotamaka Sutta was preached.

He was one of the originators of the Vedic runes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vin.i.245; D.i.104; M.ii.164, 200; Mil.162, etc.; cf. Vasistha in Vedic Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vásettha.&lt;/b&gt; Name of a gotta, probably tracing its descent to the sage Vásettha (Skt. Vasistha). In the Mahá Parinibbána Sutta (D.ii.147, 159) we find the Mallas of Kusinára addressed as Vásetthá, as well as the Mallas of Pává (D.iii.209). It was a gotta held in esteem (ukkattha). E.g., Vin.iv.8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vásettha.&lt;/b&gt; A young brahmin who, with his friend Bháradvája, visited the Buddha and held discussions with him. These discussions are recorded in the Tevijja Sutta, the Vásettha Sutta, and the Aggañña Sutta. Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.399; SNA.ii.463; cf. SN., p.116) that Vásettha was the chief disciple of Pokkharasáti. According to him again (DA.ii.406; cf.iii.860, 872), Vásettha's first visit to the Buddha was on the occasion of the preaching of the Vásettha Sutta, at the conclusion of which he accepted the Buddha as his teacher. He again did so, when, at his next visit, the Buddha preached to him the Tevijja Sutta. Soon after, he entered the Order, and, at the conclusion of the preaching of the Aggañña Sutta, he was given the higher ordination and attained arahantship. He belonged to a very rich family and renounced forty crores when he left the world. He was an expert in the three Vedas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vásettha. &lt;/b&gt;A lay disciple, evidently distinct from Vásettha (3). He visited the Buddha at the Kútagárasálá in Vesáli and the </data>
<data>Buddha preached to him (A.iv.258). See Vásettha Sutta (2). He is mentioned among the Buddha's eminent lay disciples. A.iii.451.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Vásettha. &lt;/b&gt;A brahmin; see Dhúmakári. The scholiast explains (J.iii.402) that he belonged to the Vásetthagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Vásettha. &lt;/b&gt;A brahmin of Kapilavatthu, father of Vappa Thera. ThagA.i.140.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Vásettha.&lt;/b&gt; A very rich brahmin, father of Sela Thera.

Vácissara. &lt;/b&gt;A Singhalese monk who wrote Commentaries to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhadatta')"&gt;Buddhadatta's&lt;/a&gt; works:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhidhammaavataara')"&gt;Abhidhammávatára&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vinaya_vinicchaya')"&gt;Vinaya-Vinicchaya&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttaravinicchaya')"&gt;Uttara-Vinicchaya&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khemappakarana')"&gt;Khemappakarana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He probably belonged to the twelfth century, and was also the author of the Rúpárúpa-Vibhánga and the Símálankára (q.v.). P.L.C.108f., 156, 174, 202; also Gv.62, 71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vácissara.&lt;/b&gt; A monk of Ceylon, pupil of Sáriputta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous works are assigned to him, among them commentaries on the various books of grammar:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Sambandhacintá tíká,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Subodhálankára tíká &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Vuttodayavivarana.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wrote the Sumangalapasádaní on the Khuddasikkhá and a commentary on the Moggallánavyákarana (P.L.C. 204).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He seems also to have written the Páli Thúpavamsa and several books in Singhalese. P.L.C.217; also Gv.62, 71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vácissara Thera. &lt;/b&gt;Probably identical with (2) above.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was at the head of the Sangha in the reign of Vijayabáhu III., and had hidden the Alms bowl and Tooth relic of the Buddha in Kotthumala, in order to preserve them. After that, he went to South India for protection. Later, he was sent for by Vijayabáhu, whom he helped in the reformation of the Sangha. </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vanní&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a people inhabiting the north east of Ceylon. They are first mentioned in the Chronicles (Cv.lxxxi.11), in the reign of Vijayabáhu III. (1232 36), who, with their help, gained the throne of Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They appear to have inhabited the frontier country between Jaffna and the Singhalese kingdom and were either subjects of one or other of these states, or affected complete independence, according to the strength of their neighbours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vijayabáhu IV. made friends with the Vanni chiefs and gave into their hands the protection of Anurádhapura (Cv.lxxxviii.87). They seem to have been a warlike people. Today they occupy a few small villages in the North Central Province of Ceylon and go in largely for hunting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their origin is unknown, though they are called Síhalá (E.g., Cv.lxxxiii.10). Several of their chieftains are mentioned by name, as having been overcome by Bhuvanekabáhu I. -  e.g., Kadalíváta, Apána, Tipa, Himiyánaka (Cv.xc.33). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjective from Vanní is Vañña.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vattaniya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hermitage (senásana) where lived Rohana Nágasena's teacher, by whom he was ordained, and Assagutta, with whom he spent a vassa in order to train himself for debate. Mil. 10, 12, 14; from the context it would appear as though these two residences were not identical, but were far away from each other. Was Vattaniyasenásana rather a generic than a proper name?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assagutta, who ordained the Ajívaka Janasána (q.v.), is also said to have been &quot;Vattaniyasenásane.&quot; (MT. 192). At the ceremony of the Mahá Thúpa foundation, the Thera Uttara came from &quot;Vattaniyasenásana&quot; in Viñjhátaví with sixty thousand others (Mhv.xxix.40). Both the Visuddhimagga and the Atthasáliní (Vsm.430; DhSA.419) mention a Thera named Assagutta, evidently a visitor, who, seeing the monks at Vattaniyasenásana eating dry food, resolved &quot;Every day before meals may the pool of water take on the taste of milk curds.&quot; From that day the pool water tasted of curds before the meal and became natural water again after the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In his previous birth he was the brahmin Mahásena (q.v.). During pregnancy his mother invited Sáriputta with five hundred monks, to her house, and fed them on milk rice. She herself put on yellow robes and ate of the rice left by the monks. On the day of his naming, he presented Sáriputta with his blanket. He was called Tissa after Sáriputta, whose personal name was Upatissa. At the age of seven Tissa joined the Order and his parents held a festival lasting for seven days, distributing porridge and honey to the monks. On the eighth day, when Tissa went for alms in Sávatthi, he received one thousand bowls of alms and one thousand pieces of cloth, all of which he gave to the monks. This earned for him the name of Pindapátadáyaka. One day, in the cold season, he saw monks warming themselves before fires and, discovering that they had no blankets, he, accompanied by one thousand monks, went into the city. Wherever he went people gave him blankets; one shopkeeper had hidden two of his very costly blankets, but on seeing Tissa he gave them willingly. Tissa thus got one thousand blankets and was thereafter called Kambaladáyaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having discovered that, at Jetavana, his young relations came too often to see him, he obtained a formula of meditation and went into the forest to a distance of twenty leagues from Sávatthi. At the request of the inhabitants of the village near by, he spent the rainy season in the forest hermitage, going into the village for alms. There, at the end of two months, he attained arahantship. Because he was so devoted to the forest, he was given the name of Vanavásí. At the end of the vassa, all the Buddha's chief disciples, with a retinue of forty thousand monks, visited Tissa in his hermitage, arriving </data>
<data>there in the evening. The villagers, recognizing Sáriputta, asked him to preach the Dhamma, saying that Tissa, their teacher, knew only two sentences   &quot;May you be happy, may you obtain release from suffering!&quot;   which sentences he repeated whenever anyone made him a gift. Thereupon Sáriputta asked him to explain the meaning of the two sentences, and the novice preached till sunrise, summarizing the whole of the Buddha's teaching “even as a thunderstorm rains incessantly upon the four great continents.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the discourse Tissa's supporters were divided into two camps, some were offended that he should not have preached to them before, while others marvelled at his saintliness and skill. The Buddha, aware of this disagreement, went himself to the village. The villagers gave alms to the Buddha and the monks, and, in returning thanks, the Buddha told them how fortunate they were that, owing to Tissa, they had been able to see himself and his chief disciples. They were then all satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the way back to Sávatthi, Tissa walked beside the Buddha and pointed out to him the various beautiful spots. The Buddha preached the Upasálhaka Játaka to show that there was no spot on earth where men had not at some time died. In answer to a question of the Buddha, Tissa said that he never felt afraid of the animals in the forest, but only a greater love for the forest at the sound of their voices. He then recited fifty stanzas in praise of life in the wilds. Arrived at the outskirts of the forest, he took leave of the Buddha and Sáriputta and returned to live in his forest hermitage. DhA.ii.84-102. The visit of Buddha is also reported at DA.i.240 and MA.i.357, though the details are the different. There the Buddha is accompanied by Sáriputta and the chief disciples and twenty thousand arahants.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vanavásí Thera.&lt;/b&gt; The Theragáthá Commentary (i.440) mentions a Vanavásí Thera as the teacher of Tekicchakáni. This is probably not a proper name but only a descriptive epithet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vanavásí Nikáya&lt;/b&gt;. See Araññavásí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vanavásí Mahátissa. &lt;/b&gt;A monk, probably distinct from Vanavásí Tissa -  see Vanavásí (1). On the day that Alindakavásí Mahá Phussadeva Thera attained arahantship, the devas stood by him, illuminating all the forest. Mahátissa saw the light, and the next day asked Phussadeva the reason for it, but his question was evaded. SA.iii.154f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He had a gardener named Sañjaya. A vátamiga used to visit the royal park, and the king asked Sañjaya to catch it. Sañjaya put honey on the grass where the animal fed, and, in due course, the animal came to eat out of his hand. He was thus able to entice it right into the palace, where he shut the door on it. The king marvelled that a vátamiga, who was so shy that if it once saw a man it would not visit the same place for a week after, should allow itself to be caught by greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Cullapindapátika Tissa (q.v.), who was enticed back to the lay life by a slave girl. Sañjaya is identified with the slave and the vátamiga with the monk. J.i.156ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.199), however, it was with reference to Sundarasamudda that the story was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vakkali &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vakkali Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family of Sávatthi and became proficient in the three Vedas. After he once saw the Buddha he could never tire of looking at him, and followed him about. In order to be closer to him he became a monk, and spent all his time, apart from meals and bathing, in contemplating the Buddha's person. One day the Buddha said to him, &quot;The sight of my foul body is useless; he who sees the Dhamma, he it is that seeth me&quot; (yo kho dhammam passati so mam passati; yo mam passati so dhammam passati) (Cp. Itv. sec. 92). But even then Vakkali would not leave the Buddha till, on the last day of the rains, the Buddha commanded him to depart. Greatly grieved, Vakkali sought the precipices of Gijjhakúta. The Buddha, aware of this, appeared before him and uttered a stanza; then stretching out his hand, he said: &quot;Come, monk.&quot; Filled with joy, Vakkali rose in the air pondering on the Buddha's words and realized arahantship. AA.i.140f.; the Apadána account (Ap.ii.465f.) is similar. It says that the Buddha spoke to him from the foot of the rock. Vakkali jumped down to meet the Buddha, a depth of many cubits, but he alighted unhurt. It was on this occasion that the Buddha declared his eminence among those of implicit faith; also DhA.iv.118f. The DhA. reports three verses uttered by the Buddha in which he assures Vakkali that he will help him and look after him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Theragáthá, Commentary (ThagA.i.420), when Vakkali was dismissed by the Buddha he lived on Gijjhakúta, practising meditation, but could not attain insight because of his emotional nature (saddhá). The Buddha then gave him a special exercise, but neither could he achieve this, and, from lack of food, he suffered from cramp. The Buddha visited </data>
<data>him and uttered a verse to encourage him. Vakkali spoke four verses (Thag.350 4) in reply, and, conjuring up insight, won arahantship. Later, in the assembly of the monks, the Buddha declared him foremost among those of implicit faith (saddhádhimuttánam) (cp. A.i.25; also Dvy.49 and VibhA.276; Vsm.i.129). In the Páráyanavagga (SN. vs. 1146) the Buddha is represented as holding Vakkali up to Pingiya as an example of one who won emancipation through faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta account (S.iii.119ff.; SA.ii.229) gives more details and differs in some respects from the above. There, Vakkali fell ill while on his way to visit the Buddha at Rájagaha, and was carried in a litter to a potter's shed in Rájagaha. There, at his request, the Buddha visited him and comforted him. He questioned Vakkali, who assured him that he had no cause to reprove himself with regard to morals (sílato); his only worry was that he had not been able to see the Buddha earlier. The Buddha told him that seeing the Dhamma was equivalent to seeing him, and because Vakkali had realized the Dhamma, there would be no hereafter for him. After the Buddha had left, Vakkali asked his attendants to take him to Kálasilá on Isigili. The Buddha was on Gijjhakúta and was told by two devas that Vakkali was about to &quot;obtain release.&quot; The Buddha sent word to him: &quot;Fear not, Vakkali, your dying will not be evil.&quot; Vakkali rose from his bed to receive the Buddha's message, and sending word to the Buddha that he had no desire or love for the body or the other khandhas, he drew a knife and killed himself. The Buddha went to see his body, and declared that he had obtained Nibbána and that Mára's attempt to find the consciousness of Vakkali would prove useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds that Vakkali was conceited and blind to his remaining faults. He thought he was a khínásava, and that he might rid </data>
<data>himself of bodily pains by death. However, the stab with the knife caused him such pain that at the moment of dying he realized his puthujjana state, and, putting forth great effort, attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His resolve to become chief among the saddhádhimuttas had been made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he saw a monk also named Vakkali similarly honoured by the Buddha. Ap.ii.465f.; AA.i.140.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vakkali. &lt;/b&gt;A monk in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, declared chief of those having implicit faith. ThagA.i.422; Ap.ii.466.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vakkali Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The account, given in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.iii.119ff ) of the attainment of arahantship and death of Vakkali (1) (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Vajirá answers that there is no such thing as “being,&quot; apart from certain conditioned factors, like a chariot, which exists only because of its parts. Mára retires discomfited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vajirá's verses are often quoted (E.g Kvu. 240, 626; Mil. p.28; Vsm.ii.593) both in the Canon and in later works, but they are not included in the Therígáthá, nor do we know anything else about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

Vangísa's teacher, Nigrodhakappa, had just died there, and Vangísa asks the Buddha if he had attained Nibbána. Vangísa's question is really a poem in itself, containing ten verses, in praise of the Buddha. The Buddha says that Kappa has won Nibbána, because he had severed all the bonds of Mára. Vangísa then declares that Kappa attained that state because he followed the Buddha's teaching. SN. pp. 59ff.; the verses of the sutta are included in the Theragáthá (1263 79).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Commentary (SNA.i.345) the sutta is called Nigrodhakappa Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Bháradvája maintained that it was pure descent from seven generations of ancestors, with neither break nor blemish in the lineage, whereas Vásettha contended that virtue and moral behaviour made a true brahmin. As neither could convince the other, they agreed to refer the matter to the Buddha, who said it was not birth but deeds which made the true brahmin. M.ii.196ff.

A female crocodile in the river longed to eat his heart and her husband persuaded the monkey to go for a ride on his back in search of wild fruits. In midstream he began to sink and revealed his purpose, and the monkey, nothing daunted, said that monkeys did not keep their hearts in their bodies for fear of their being torn to pieces on the trees, but that they hung them on trees, and, pointing to a ripe fig tree, showed the crocodile what he said was his heart. The crocodile took him to the tree, and the monkey jumped ashore and laughed at him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's attempt to kill the Buddha. J.iii.133f.; cf.

It was preached at Sávatthi to the brahmin Aggikabháradvája (it is thus also called the Aggikabháradvája Sutta, SNA.174), who reviled the Buddha, calling him outcaste (vasala) when the Buddha went to his house for alms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha replied that the brahmin knew neither the meaning of vasala, nor what makes a man such. At the request of the brahmin he preached this sutta, the burden of which is that it is not by birth that one is an outcaste or a brahmana, but by one's deeds (SN., pp. 21f). The Sutta is also included in the Parittas (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was a friend of the Mettiyabhummajaká (q.v.), and, at their instigation, charged Dabba Mallaputta with having committed adultery with his wife. Dabba repudiated the charge, and the Buddha ordered the monks to proclaim the pattanikkujjana on Vaddha. When Ananda visited Vaddha and told him this news he fell in a faint, and, later, visited the Buddha with his family to ask for forgiveness. He was ordered to go before the Sangha and confess his error, after which the sentence was revoked.

Agitated by this, he returned to his monastery, and, during his siesta, developed insight, attaining arahantship. ThagA.i.413f. Six of his verses appear in Thag.335-9; ep.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vangísa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family and was proficient in the Vedas. He gained repute by tapping on skulls with his finger nail and telling thereby where the owners of the skull were reborn. During three years he thus gained much money. Then, in spite of the protests of his colleagues, he went to see the Buddha, who gave him the skull of an arahant (according to the Apadána, he saw Sáriputta first and learnt from him about the Buddha). Vangísa could make nothing of this and joined the Order to learn its secret. He was ordained by Nigrodhakappa, and, meditating on the thirty two constituents of the body, he won arahantship. He then visited the Buddha again and praised him in various verses, full of similes and metaphors. This brought him reputation as a poet (Kávyacitta or Káveyyamatta). Later the Buddha declared him foremost among those pre eminent in ready expression (patibhánavantánam). His resolve to attain to this position was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. A.i.24; Dpv.iv.4; ThagA.ii.192ff.; AA.i.149ff.; DhA.iv.226f.; SNA.i.345f.; Ap.ii.495ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá contains numerous verses spoken by him on various occasions (Thag.1208 79; most of these are repeated at S.i.183ff )   some of them (1209-18) uttered about himself, his attempts to suppress desires excited by the sight of gaily dressed women (Cf. S.i.185; on one such occasion, he confessed his disaffection to Ananda, who admonished him.); others (1219-22) were self admonitions against conceit because of his facility of speech; some were spoken in praise of sermons preached by the Buddha -  e.g., the Subhásita Sutta (1227-30), a sutta on Nibbána (1238-45), and a sutta preached at the Pavárana ceremony (1231-7). Several verses were in praise of his colleagues -  e.g. Sáriputta (1231-3), Aññá Kondañña (1246-8), </data>
<data>and Moggallána (1249-51). One of Vangísa's long poems (vvs. 1263-74) is addressed to the Buddha, questioning him as to the destiny of his (Vangísa's) teacher Nigrodhakappa. The Commentary (ThagA.ii.211) explains that when Nigrodhakappa died Vangísa was absent and wished to be assured by the Buddha that his teacher had reached Nibbána. But the poem is more than a question. It is really a eulogy of the Buddha. Another verse (1252) describes the Buddha as he sat surrounded by his monks on the banks of the Gaggará at Campá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta (S.i.185ff.; SA.i.207ff ) devotes one whole section to Vangísa, dealing with the incidents connected with his life and giving poems made by him on these occasions. The Milinda (p. 390)'also contains a poem attributed to Vangísa in praise of the Buddha. According to the Apadána (Ap.ii.497, vs.27), he was called Vangísa, both because he was born in Vanga and also because he was master of the spoken word (vacana). See also Vangísa Sutta and Subhásita Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Vanavaccha Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was the son of Vacchagotta a brahmin of Kapilavatthu, and was born in the forest, his mother having longed to see it and having been taken in travail while wandering there. His name was Vaccha; but because of his love for the woods, he was called Vanavaccha. He left the world soon after the Buddha's Renunciation, and led the ascetic life till he heard of the Buddha's Enlightenment. Then he joined the Order, and it was in the forest that he strove and won arahantship. When he returned to Kapilavatthu with the Buddha, his companions asked him why he so loved the forest, and he spoke a verse in praise of forest life (Thag.13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Atthadassí Buddha, he was a large tortoise living in the Vinatá. Seeing the Buddha about to cross the river, he took him on his back. Many hundreds of times afterwards he lived as an ascetic in the forest. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he became a dove, and his heart was gladdened by the sight of a monk practicing compassion. Later he was born as a householder in Benares and renounced the world. ThagA.i.58f.; Ap.ii.506f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vanavaccha Thera.&lt;/b&gt; The son of a rich brahmin of Rájagaha; he joined the Order, impressed by the majesty of the Buddha's visit to Bimbisára. Soon after, he attained arahantship and, devoted to detachment, dwelt in the woods hence his name. When he went to Rájagaha his kinsmen asked him to live near them, but he said he preferred the lonely life of the forest (Thag.113).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a labourer, and, having committed a crime, while fleeing from justice he saw a Bodhi tree. Pleased with the look of the tree, he gathered masses of asoka flowers and </data>
<data>heaped them up round the tree. When his pursuers reached him, he remained as he was, looking at them, with no hatred in his heart. They hurled him into a precipice, and he died with the thought of the Bodhi tree in his heart. Three kappas ago he was a king named Santusita (ThagA.i.222). He is perhaps identical with Tambapupphiya of the Apadána. Ap.i.176.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vaddhakisúkara Játaka (No. 283)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A carpenter of a village near Benares was once wandering in the forest, and having found a young boar in a pit, took him home and brought him up. The boar was well mannered and helped the carpenter in his work, and so he came to be called Vaddhakisúkara (&quot;Carpenter boar&quot;). When he grew up, the carpenter took him back to the forest, and there he came across some boars who lived in mortal fear of a tiger. The young boar drilled his army of boars, arranged them in battle array, and awaited the tiger. When he arrived, the boars, under their leader's instructions, mimicked the tiger in all he did. The tiger, thereupon, sought the advice of a false ascetic who shared his prey, and, following his counsel, made a leap at the boar leader and fell into a pit which had been dug for him. There the boars attacked him and ate him, and those who were unable to get any of the flesh sniffed at the others' mouths to see how &quot;tiger&quot; tasted. Then they set off after the false ascetic, and when he climbed a fig tree they dug it up and it fell to the ground. The man was torn to pieces and his body licked clean. The boars then placed their leader on the tree trunk, consecrated him king with water, which they fetched in the dead man's skull, and made a young sow his consort. (This is how kings came to be consecrated with water from shells and seated on a throne of fig planks.) The Bodhisatta who was then a tree sprite sang the boar's praises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Dhanuggahatissa (q.v.), who was responsible for Pasenadi's victory over Ajátasattu.

He was the nephew of Mahákála, and when Sonuttara went to the Nága world to obtain the Buddha's relics for the Mahá Thúpa, Mahákála signed to Vásuladatta to hide them. Vásuladatta assumed a huge Nága form, three hundred leagues long, with a head one league in extent, and having swallowed the casket containing the relics, lay down at the foot of Sineru. But Sonuttara, by his iddhi power, put his hand into the Nága's stomach and removed the invisible relics. Mhv.xxxi.52ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>

He was born in a brahmin family of Kosala, and having heard a forest dwelling monk preach, entered the Order. One day, when on his way to visit the Buddha, he saw a fight between snakes and mongooses, in which many of them perished. Distressed by the sight of their hatred for each other, he sought the help of the Buddha, who preached to him three stanzas (Thag.237-9). At the end of the recitation, Várana developed insight and became an arahant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety two kappas ago he was born in the family of the brahmin Sumedha, and becoming expert in brahmin lore, he entered the ascetic life. As he sat teaching hymns to his pupils there was an earthquake, marking the conception of Tissa Buddha. People, in terror, sought the sage, who explained it to them, thereby himself experiencing great joy in contemplating the glory of the Buddha (ThagA.i.353f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Nimittivyákaraníya of the Apadána.

A hen may wish for her chicks to break through their eggs with foot, or claw, or mouth, or beak, but they will not do so till they are fully warmed, fully brooded over by the hen. When they are ready to break through, they will do so, irrespective of the hen's wish. A carpenter knows that his adze handle has worn away, not by looking at the finger marks on the handle, but just by its wearing away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A seagoing vessel, stranded without water and beaten on by wind and sun, will fall to pieces easily and without effort. So will the ásavas in a monk who dwells attentive to self training. S.iii.152f.; cp. A.iv.126f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She was the daughter of Candappajjota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pajjota heard that Udena's splendour surpassed his own, he resolved to capture him. He was told that Udena could charm elephants with his magic lute, and had a wooden elephant made in which he placed sixty men. A woodsman was sent to inform Udena of the new elephant which had appeared in the forest, and he set out to capture it. The men inside the elephant caused it to run, and, in the course of the chase, Udena was separated from his retinue and taken captive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three days Pajjota feasted in celebration of his victory, and Udena asked him either to release him or order his death. Pajjota promised release if Udena would teach him the elephant charm; but Udena would teach only to one who paid him homage as a teacher, and this Pajjota would not do. Then Pajjota contrived that Udena should teach it to Vásuladattá. A curtain was hung between them, Udena was told that his pupil was a hunch backed woman of the court, while Udena was described to the princess as a leper who knew a priceless charm.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many days Udena tried to teach the charm, but the princess could not learn it. In impatience, Udena said: &quot;Dunce of a hunchback, thy lips are too thick and thy cheeks too fat; I've a mind to beat thy face in.&quot; And the princess replied: &quot;Villain of a leper, what meanest thou by calling me hunchback?&quot; Udena lifted the fringe of the curtain and they saw each other. From that moment they planned to escape and marry. There was no more learning of charms nor giving of lessons. When their plans were complete, Vásuladattá told her father that she </data>
<data>needed a conveyance and the use of a gate in the city wall. To work the charm, she explained, a certain herb was necessary, which must be obtained at night, at a time indicated by the stars. Thus she secured the use of Pajjota's female elephant, Bhaddavatí, and permission to use a certain door at any time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one day, when Pajjota was out on pleasure, the two filled several bags with gold and silver coins and they started off on Bhaddavatí. The harem guards gave the alarm and the king sent men in pursuit. Udena opened first a sack of gold and then one of silver, scattering the coins, which delayed his pursuers, greedy for the coins. He, meanwhile, hurried on and reached the stockade where his soldiers awaited him. They conducted him and Vásuladattá, to Kosambí, where she was made Udena's chief consort.

Vásudeva is addressed (J.iv.84; he is called Kanha at J.vi.421) as Kanha and again as Kesava. The scholiast explains (J.iv.84) that he is called Kanha because he belonged to the Kanháyanagotta, and Kesava because he had beautiful hair (kesasobhanatáya). These names, however, give support to the theory (see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa')"&gt;Andhakavenhudásaputtá&lt;/a&gt;, No.1) that the story of Vásudeva was associated with the legend of Krsna. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546')"&gt;Maháummagga Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.421) it is stated that Jambávatí, mother of King Sivi, was the consort of Vásudeva Kanha. The scholiast identifies this Vásudeva with the eldest of the Andhakavenhudásaputtá, and says that Jambávatí was a candalí. Vásudeva fell in love with her because of her great beauty and married her in spite of her caste.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vajirapáni&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yakkha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that whoever, even up to the third time of being asked, refuses to answer a reasonable question put by a Buddha, his head will split into pieces on the spot. It was Vajirapáni's duty to frighten such people by appearing before them in the sky, armed with a thunderbolt, which he was ready to hurl if necessary. He was visible only to the Buddha and the person in question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two instances of this are given in the books -  once in the case of Ambattha, (D.i.95; cf. the story in the Ayakúta Játaka) and again in that of Saccaka Niganthaputta (M.i.231). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.264; MA.i.457; cp. Dvy.130) that Vajirapáni is identical with Sakka, and proceeds to describe the fierce appearance assumed by him on these occasions. This arrangement was made in fulfilment of a promise made by Sakka, in the presence of Mahá Brahmá, when the Buddha was reluctant to preach the Dhamma (See Vin.i.5f), that if the Buddha would establish his rule of the Dhamma (Dhammacakka), Sakka would afford it the necessary protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some places (E.g., Cv.xcvi.37; see also J.R.A.S. 1916, p.733f), Vajirapáni's conquest of the Asuras is alluded to, thus establishing his identity with Indra. See also Vajirahattha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He teaches only what is upheld by the world of sages and proceeds to describe what this teaching is. Like a lotus which, though it arises and grows in the water, is yet unspotted by it, so a Tathágata, arisen and grown in the world, is yet unspotted by it.

Valliya Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was the son of a Malla chieftain of Pává and joined the Order with his companions, Godhika, Subáhu and Uttiya, when they went on some embassy to Kapilavatthu and saw the Yamakapátiháriya in Nigrodháráma. Bimbisára later built huts for them, but he forgot to roof them, and so there was no rain till the roofs were added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Siddhattha Buddha, Valliya offered him a handful of flowers. ThagA.i.123; his verse is included in the Thag. (vs. 53).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Valliya Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He was the son of an eminent brahmin of Sávatthi, and, owing to his good friends, he met the Buddha and joined the Order, soon after attaining arahantship. Thirty one kappas ago he saw the Pacceka Buddha Nárada at the foot of a tree, and built for him a hut of reeds, which he thatched with grass, together with a cloistered walk strewn with sand. He was seventy one times king of the devas and thirty four times king of men. ThagA.i.247; two verses in the Thag. (125-6) are attributed to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Nalágárika of the Apadána. Ap.i.278f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Valliya Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a brahmin family of Vesáli, and was named Gandimitta (v.l. Kanhamitta). Much struck by the Buddha when he came to Vesáli, he joined the Order under Mahá Kaccáyana. Because he was dull of insight and depended too much on his colleagues, he was called Valliya (creeper), like the ivy which must lean on something in order to grow. Later, following the advice of Venudatta Thera, he developed insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a rich brahmin, well versed in learning. Later, he renounced eighty crores of wealth, and, after </data>
<data>becoming an ascetic, lived on a river bank. There the Buddha visited him, and, seated on an antelope skin, preached the Doctrine. The ascetic paid him great honour and gave him mangoes and perfume and flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Apadána verses, quoted in ThagA., it is said that Valliya was born in the city of Vebhára, built by Vissakamma, and that he left the household at the age of five. ThagA.i.292f.; two verses addressed by him to Venudatta are included in the Thag. (167-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Candanamáliya of the Apadána.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vajjiputta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vajjiputta Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to the family of a minister of Vesáli, and, seeing the majesty of the Buddha who visited the city, he joined the Order and lived in a wood near by. A festival took place in Vesáli, with much singing and dancing and gaiety. This distracted Vajjiputta, and he expressed his disgust in a verse spoken in scorn of the forest life. A woodland sprite heard him and upbraided him, saying, &quot;Though you spurn life in the forest, the wise, desiring solitude, think much of it,&quot; and she then uttered a verse praising it. This verse, which the monk afterwards repeated, is included in Thag.vs.62. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urged on by the sprite's words, Vajjiputta developed insight and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety one kappas ago he had been a householder and had paid homage to Vipassí Buddha, with pollen from nága flowers. Forty five kappas ago he was a king, named Renu. ThagA.i.142f. Vajjiputta's story is given very briefly in S.i.201f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vajjiputta's story is also given in the Dhammapada Commentary. There he is called a rájá, and is said to have renounced his kingdom when his turn came to rule. On the day of the festival, on the full moon day of Kattika, he was filled with discontent. After his conversation with the woodland sprite, he sought the Buddha, who preached to him. He attained arahantship at the end of the Buddha's sermon. DhA.iii.460f.; see also SA.i.228, where also he is called rájá. There may be some confusion between Vajjiputta (1) and (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently to be identified with Renupújaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.146.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vajjiputta Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a Licchavi rájá's family, and while still young, and learning various arts, such as </data>
<data>training elephants, he was filled with the desire for renunciation. One day he went to a vihára where the Buddha was preaching, entered the Order, and not long after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha’s death, when the chief Elders were living in various places prior to their agreed meeting for the recital of the Dhamma, he saw Ananda, still a learner (sekha), teaching the Doctrine to a large assembly. Wishing to urge him to higher attainment, Vajjiputta uttered a verse, and this verse was among those which led to Ananda's attainment of arahantship. The verse is found in Thag.vs.119. In S.i.199 the verse is attributed to a forest deva who wished to agitate Ananda. In Rockhill (op. cit., 155f.), Vajjiputta was Ananda's attendant at the time and preached to the people while Ananda meditated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety four kappas ago, Vajjiputta had seen a Pacceka Buddha begging for alms and had given him plantain fruits.

He was the son of Vásettha, a brahmin of Kapilavatthu. When Asita declared that Prince Siddhattha would become the Buddha, Vappa and four other brahmins, headed by Kondañña, became recluses. Vappa was with the Buddha during the six years of his ascetic practices, but being disappointed when the Buddha began taking solid food, he left him and went to Isipatana, where the Buddha, after his Enlightenment, preached to him and the others the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. On the fifth day after, Vappa and his companions became arahants, at the end of the Anattalakkhana Sutta. Vappa became a sotápanna on the second day of the quarter (AA.i.84); pátipadadivase, says ThagA. (loc. infra) and MA.i.390.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vappa's resolve to be among the first of the Buddha's followers was taken in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. In the past, he was sixteen times king, under the name of Mahádundubhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThagA.i.140f.; a verse attributed to him is found in Thag.61); see also J.i.82; Dpv.i.32; Vin.i.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

The Buddha joins them and tells Vappa how the ásavas can be completely destroyed so that the monk who has so destroyed them will abide in the six satata viháras with equanimity, mindful and comprehending. Vappa is convinced of the superiority of the Buddha's teaching and becomes his follower. A.ii.196f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* AA.ii.559 says he was the Buddha's uncle (cúlapitá) and a Sákiyan rájá.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vattagámaní Abhaya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (29 17 B.C.). He was the son of Saddhátissa, and came to the throne by killing the usurper Mahárattaka (v.l. Kammahárattaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He married Anulá, wife of Khallátanága, and adopted Mahácúlika as his own son; because of this Vattagámaní came to be known as Pitirájá (this name occurs several times in the Commentaries -  e.g., VibhA. passim, see Pitirájá). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vattagámaní had a second wife, Somadeví, and also a son of his own, called Coranága. In the fifth month of his reign a brahmin, named Tissa, rose against him, but was defeated by seven Damilas who landed at Mahátittha. . After that, the Damilas waged war against the king and defeated him at Kolambálaka. It was a remark made by the Nigantha Giri to Vattagámainí, as he fled from the battle, that led later to the establishment of Abhayagiri (q.v.). The king hid in the forest in Vessagiri and was rescued by Kupikkala Mahátissa, who gave him over to the care of Tanasíva. In his flight he left Somadeví behind, and she was captured by the Damilas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fourteen years Vattagámaní and his queen Anulá lived under the protection of Tanasíva, and, during this time, five Damilas ruled in succession at Anurádhapura; they were Pulahattha, Báhiya, Panayamára, Pilayamára and Dáthika. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a time, Anulá quarrelled with Tanasíva's wife, and the king, in his resentment, killed Tanasíva. Later, when he also killed Kapisísa, his ministers left him in disgust, but were persuaded by Mahátissa to return. When his preparations were complete, the king attacked Dáthika, slew him, and took the throne. He then founded Abhayagiri-vihára and recovered Somadeví. He also built the Silásobbhakandaka-cetiya. He had seven ministers who themselves built several viháras; among them Uttiya, Múla, Sáliya, Pabbata and </data>
<data>Tissa are mentioned by name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the reign of Vattagámaní that the Buddhist Canon and its Commentaries were first reduced to writing in Ceylon, according to tradition, in Aloka vihára. For details of Vattagámaní's reign see Dpv.xx.14ff.; Mhv.xxxiii.34ff. The foundation of Abhayagiri vihára formed the beginning of dissensions in the ranks of the monks (Cv.lxxiii.18). Vattagámani was, however, regarded by later generations as a great protector of the faith (Cv.lxxxii.23). Various monasteries, chiefly rock temples, are traditionally ascribed to Vattagámaní, and said to have been built by him during his exile; among these is the modern Dambulla vihára. The Cúlavamsa calls him the founder of the Majjhavela vihára. Cv.c.229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A.ii.35f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vassakára Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Vassakára visits the Buddha at Veluvana and asks him a series of questions. The Buddha, in answer, says that a bad man cannot, as a good man can, recognize either a good man or a bad man as such. Vassakára then relates how, once, the followers of the brahmin Todeyya spoke ill of Eleyya and his retinue for showing homage to Rámaputta; he now understands why they honour Rámaputta; it is because he is wiser than they. A.ii.179f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vassakára Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;Vassakára visits the Buddha at Gijjhakúta, at the request of Ajátasattu, and tells him of the latter’s desire to destroy the Vajjians.

These points are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) The storing of salt in a horn (singilonakappa);  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) the eating of food when the shadow of the sun had   passed two fingers' breadth beyond noon (duvangulakappa); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) to eat once and then go again to the village for   alms (gámantarakappa); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) the holding of the uposatha separately by monks   dwelling in the same district (ávásakappa); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(5) the carrying out of an official act when the   assembly is incomplete (anumatikappa); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(6) the following of a practice because it is so done   by one's tutor or teacher (ácinnakappa); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(7) the eating of sour milk by one who has already had   his midday meal (amathitakappa); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(8) the use of strong drink before it has fermented (jalogikappa);  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(9) the use of a rug which is not of the proper size (nisídanakappa);  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(10) the use of gold and silver (játarúparajatakappa).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The orthodox monks refused to agree to these points, and one of their leaders, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa')"&gt;Yasa Kákandakaputta&lt;/a&gt;, publicly condemned the action of the Vajjiputtakas. Yasa then left &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambí&lt;/a&gt;, and, having summoned monks from&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava')"&gt;Pává&lt;/a&gt; in </data>
<data>the west and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avanti')"&gt;Avanti&lt;/a&gt; in the south, sought &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sambhuta')"&gt;Sambhúta Sánavási&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ahogangaa')"&gt;Ahoganga&lt;/a&gt;.

Soon after was held a recital of the Doctrine in which seven hundred monks took part under the leadership of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata')"&gt;Soreyya-Revata&lt;/a&gt;. The recital lasted eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the Vajjiputtaka heresy is given in the twelfth chapter of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_vagga')"&gt;Cullavagga&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.ii.294ff.); the Mhv.iv.9ff. gives more details in certain respects; see also Dpv.iv.48ff.; v.17ff.; 32ff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that even during the Buddha's life five hundred monks, described as Vajjiputtaká, seceded from the Order and joined &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; though they were later brought back by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.ii.199f.). &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; actually (Sp.i.228) identifies the heretics as belonging to the same party.

He was a sámanera, and, during the prevalence of the Brahmanatissabhaya (q.v.), looked after his teacher at the risk of his own life, once even climbing a palmyra tree in order to get him some nuts. Later, feeling that the care of an old and feeble man was too much for him, his teacher advised him to go away alone. The teacher was later eaten by cannibals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sámanera became famous as a Tipitakadhara, and when the Tissabhaya had disappeared, monks came from overseas to visit him. He thus became the leader of a large company, and once when he visited Anurádhapura, he received gifts of three robes in nine different places. See VibhA.449f., where the story is given in great detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Valáhassa Játaka (No. 196)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, in Tambannidípa, was a Yakkha-city called Sirísavatthu, peopled by Yakkhinís. When shipwrecked sailors were cast on the shore from the River Kalyání to Nágadípa, the yakkhinís would assume human form and entice them and use them as their husbands. On the arrival of other castaways, they would eat their former husbands and take the new arrivals as their lovers. Once five hundred merchants were cast ashore there and became the husbands of the yakkhinís. In the night the yakkhinís left them and ate their former husbands. The eldest merchant discovered this and warned the others, but only half of them were willing to attempt an escape. Now it happened that the Bodhisatta was a horse of the Valáhaka race and was flying through the air from the Himálaya to Tambapanni. There, as he passed over the banks and fields, he asked in a human voice: &quot;Who wants to go home?&quot; and the two hundred and fifty traders begged to be taken. They climbed on the horse's back and tail and he took them to their own country. The others were eaten by the yakkhinís.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had become a backslider from running after a beautifully dressed woman.

The Buddha accepted the gift and smiled. When Ananda asked the reason for the smile, the Buddha replied that the man would enjoy bliss for eighty four kappas and would then become a Pacceka Buddha named Vatamsaka.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vacchagotta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vacchagotta. &lt;/b&gt;A Paribbájaka, who later became an arahant Thera. Several conversations he had with the Buddha are mentioned in the books. For details see the Tevijja Vacchagotta-, Aggi Vacchagotta-, Mahá Vacchagotta-, Vaccha- and Vacchagotta-Suttas. Some of these suttas are quoted in the Kathávatthu (E.g., p. 267, 505). The Samyutta Nikáya contains a whole section on Vacchagotta; his discussions were chiefly concerned with such mythical questions as to whether the world is eternal, the nature of life, the existence or otherwise of the Tathágata after death, etc. S.iii.257ff.; see also S.iv.391ff., for several discussions of Vacchagotta with Moggallána, Ananda and Sabhiya Kaccána on similar topics. The three Vacchagotta Suttas of the Majjhima Nikáya seem to contain the story of Vacchagotta's conversion, in due order: at the conclusion of the Tevijja Vacchagotta (No. 72) it is merely stated that &quot;the Paribbájaka Vacchagotta rejoiced in what the Blessed One has said.&quot; At the end of the next, the Aggi Vacchagotta, he is mentioned as having accepted the Buddha as his teacher. In the third, the Mahá Vacchagotta, he seeks ordination from the Buddha at Rájagaha, and receives it after the requisite probationary period of four months. He returns to the Buddha after two weeks and tells him that he has attained all that is to be attained by a non arahant's understanding and asks for a further exposition of the Doctrine. The Buddha tells him to proceed to the study of calm and insight, whereby sixfold abhiññá may be acquired. Vacchagotta profits by the lesson and soon after becomes an arahant. He thereupon sends news of his attainment to the Buddha through some monks, and the Buddha says he has already heard the news from the devas (M.i.493 97).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;This story definitely identifies the Paribbájaka with the Thera of the same name, whose verse of ecstasy is included in the Theragáthá (vs. 112). According to the Commentary (ThagA.i.221), he belonged to a rich brahmin family of the Vaccha clan (Vacchagotta). His personal name is not given. He became an expert in brahmin learning, but failing to find therein what he sought, he became a Paribbájaka, joining the Buddha's Order later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a householder of Bandhumatí, and one day, when the Buddha and his monks were invited to the king's palace, he swept the street along which the Buddha passed and set up a Rag as decoration. As a result he was born, four kappas ago, as a rájá, Sudhaja by name. He is probably identical with Víthisammajjaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.177.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vacchagotta.&lt;/b&gt; A Paribbájaka. He is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikáva (A.i.180f ) as visiting the Buddha at Venágapura, where he was at the head of the brahmins. He is possibly to be identified with Vacchagotta (1). In this context, however, he is called Venágapurika. Vacchagotta (1) (q.v.) was a native of Rájagaha, but seems to have travelled widely, for we find him visiting the Buddha at Vesáli (M.i.481), at Sávatthi (M.i.483; S.iii.257), and at Ñátiká (S.iv. 401), in addition to his visits to Rájagaha (M.i.489). The Commentary (AA.i.410), moreover, explains Venágapuraka by &quot;Venágapuravásí,&quot; which may mean that he merely lived at Venágapura and was not necessarily a native of that place. Vacchagotta's question was as to how the Buddha looked so shining and his colour so clear? Was it because he slept on a luxurious bed? The Buddha answered that his bed was luxurious and comfortable, but from quite a different point of view. At the end of the discourse, Vacchagotta declares himself a follower of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vasabha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vasabha. &lt;/b&gt;A householder of Kutumbiyangana and father of Velusumana. Mhv.xxiii.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vasabha. &lt;/b&gt;King of Ceylon (127 171 A.C.). He was a Lambakanna of Uttarapassa and served under his uncle, the general of King Subha. As it was declared by the soothsayers that one named Vasabha would be king, Subha ordered the slaughter of all bearing that name and Vasabha's uncle took him to the court to surrender him. But the general's wife, Potthá, gave her husband betel without lime to take with him, and, on the way to the palace, Vasabha was sent back to fetch the lime. There Potthá told him of the plot against his life, gave him one thousand pieces and helped him to escape. When his plans were ready, he fought against Subha, killed both him and his uncle in battle and became king. Potthá was made his queen. Soothsayers told him that he would live only twelve years, and, after consultation with the monks, Vasabha did many acts of merit in order to prolong his life; he reigned for forty four years. Among the buildings erected by him were the Mahávalligotta vihára, the Anuráráma vihára and the Mucela vihára. He also built twelve tanks and raised the wall of Anurádhapura. His son and successor was Vankannásikattissa. For details of Vasabha's reign and works, see Dpv.xxii.1ff. and Mhv.xxxv.59ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DA.ii.635) that once Vasabha listened to Díghabhánaka monks reciting the Mahásudassana Sutta in the Ambalatthika pásáda, near Lohapásáda, and applauded the Buddha's statement contained in the sutta that all things are transient. On another occasion he went to the Katthakasálaparivena to worship an Elder named Mahásatthivassa (this may be only a descriptive title), but as he approached the door of his cell, he heard the </data>
<data>Elder's groans of pain, and, disappointed that he had not yet developed the power of suppressing pain even after sixty years of monastic life, the king turned away. The Elder was told of this by his attendant, and, putting forth great effort, attained arahantship; he thereupon sent for the king. The king lay at full length on the ground and worshipped him, saying, &quot;It is not your arahantship I worship, but the Síla you observed as a puthujjana.&quot; (DA.i.291)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another story is related of Vasabha, of how once, in order to test a monk, he sat near him and began to crush a jujube fruit. The monk's mouth watered, and Vasabha knew that he was not an Arahant (MA.ii.869).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Vasabha's queen was ill, she was cured by medicines suggested by Mahápaduma Thera. Sp.ii.471.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vasabha.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin of Varuna village. His daughter gave milk rice to Piyadassí Buddha before his Enlightenment. BuA.172.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vasabha. &lt;/b&gt;One of the chief lay supporters of Nárada Buddha. Bu.x.25; J.i.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vasabha Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a family of a Licchavi rájá of Vesáli and joined the Order when the Buddha visited that town, winning arahantship in due course. According to the Apadána verses quoted, he was born in Sávatthi and was ordained under Sáriputta at the age of seven. Out of compassion for his patrons, he enjoyed what he received from them; the common minded thereupon deemed him self indulgent. Near him lived a fraudulent monk who deceived the people by pretending to live the simple life and was greatly honoured by them. Sakka, discerning this, visited Vasabha and questioned him concerning the ways of an impostor. The Elder replied in two verses (Thag.139 40), and Sakka then warned the impostor and departed.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;In the past, when the world was without a Buddha, Vasabha was a Jatila named Nárada on Samaggapabbata, with a retinue of fourteen thousand. Seeing no one deserving of his worship, he made a cetiya of sand on the bank of the River Apadiká, in the name of the Buddhas, gilded it and offered it his homage. Eighty times he was king of devas and three hundred times king of men (ThagA.i.257ff). He is evidently to be identified with Pulinathúpiya of the Apadána. Ap.ii.437f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Vasabha.&lt;/b&gt; Called Labhiya Vasabha. One of the famous warriors of Dutthagámaní. He was called Labhiya because his body was noble in form, &quot;straight like a stick (yatthi).&quot; (MT. 459) When he was twenty years old, he started to build a tank with some friends, and he threw away masses of earth which would have needed ten or twelve ordinary men to move them. Kákavannatissa heard of this and summoned him to the court. The village irrigated by the tank was given to him, and it came to be called Vasabhodakavára. Mhv.xxiii.90ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Vasabha.&lt;/b&gt; A mountain near Himavá. ThagA.i.182; Ap.i.166.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Vasabha.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant Thera in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, declared foremost for austere practices (Ras.i.27). The name is evidently a variant of Nisabha (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He belonged to a Licchavi rájá's family in Vesáli and was a devoted follower of the Buddha, delighting in waiting upon him and in making gifts to the monks. Later, because of an offence he had committed, the Buddha passed on him the sentence of pattanikkujjana. He was much grieved and begged the forgiveness of the Sangha, and, because of his agitation, he renounced the world and joined the Order. But he was given up to sloth and torpor, till the Buddha admonished him in a verse*. He then put forth effort and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* This verse is found in the Thag.vs.40; elsewhere   (Thag.vs.1162) this verse is ascribed to Moggallána as having been spoken by   him to a monk named Tissa and again repeated (vs. 1163) by him to Vaddhamána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably to be identified with Vaddha (1), though no mention is made of Vaddha having entered the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha he had been a householder and had given the Buddha beautiful mango fruits.

The brahmin said: 'Take your tool, Sumedha (sage), and dig.' As the brahmin dug, he came across, successively, a bar, a frog, a forked passage, a strainer, a tortoise, a cleaver, a joint of meat -  all of which he was told to cast out and dig on. He then came across a cobra, which he was asked not to harm, but to worship.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the suggestion of the deity, Kassapa related the story to the Buddha, who solved the riddle. The anthill is the body, the brahmin the arahant, the tool wisdom, digging perseverance, the bar ignorance, the forked passage doubting, the strainer the five &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/n_r/niivarana')"&gt;nívaranas&lt;/a&gt;, the tortoise the fivefold &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/u_v/upaadaana')"&gt;upádána&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/khandha')"&gt;kkhandhas&lt;/a&gt;, the cleaver the fivefold pleasures of sense, the joint of meat passion's delights (nandírága), and the cobra (nága) the arahant monk (M.i.142ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentary (MA.i.340), Kumárakassapa was not an arahant at the time of the preaching of the sutta. The deity was a deity of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhaavaasaa')"&gt;Suddhávása&lt;/a&gt; brahma world. He was one of five friends who, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, had entered the Order and who, in order to meditate uninterruptedly, had climbed a rock by means of a ladder which they had then removed, thus cutting off their return. The eldest became an arahant in three days, the second (anuthera) was this deity, who had become an anágámí. The third </data>
<data>was Pukkusáti, the fourth Báhiya Dárucíriya and the last Kumárakassapa. This deity was responsible for the arahantship both of Báhiya and Kassapa, for Kassapa took the Vammíka Sutta as the subject of his meditations and thus developed insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vassakára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin, chief minister of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt;. He and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sunidha')"&gt;Sunidha&lt;/a&gt; were in charge of the fortifications of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama')"&gt;Pátaligáma&lt;/a&gt;, built against the &lt;a href="vajjii')"&gt;Vajjí&lt;/a&gt;. (Vin.i.228; Ud.viii.6; the Dígha account, D.ii.72ff. omits Sunidha. The Vinaya account omits Vassakára’s questions to the Buddha; cf. AA.ii.705ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Ajátasattu's suggestion, Vassakára visited the Buddha to discover, indirectly, whether, in the Buddha's view, there were any chances of Ajátasattu conquering the Vajjians in battle. The Buddha said that as long as the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of prosperity which he had taught them at Sárandada cetiya, they would prosper rather than decline, and this gave Vassakára the idea that the downfall of the Vajjians could be brought about by diplomacy (upalápana) or disunion (mithubheda). He thereupon conspired with the king (D.A.ii.522ff ) and, by agreement, the latter expelled him on the charge of showing favour to the Vajjians during discussions in the assembly. Vassakára then went to the Vajjian country, and the Licchavis, all unsuspecting, welcomed him and appointed him as the teacher of their children. By means of cunning and questioning the children in secret, he made them quarrel with each other, and these quarrels soon spread to the elders. In three years the Licchavis were completely disunited, and when the assembly drum was beaten, they failed to appear. Vassakára then sent a message to Ajátasattu, who was able to capture Vesáli without meeting any resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gopaka_mogga')"&gt;Gopaka Moggallána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.8ff), Vassakára is </data>
<data>represented as arriving in the middle of a conversation, which Gopaka Moggallána was holding with Ananda, having been sent to inspect the works at Rájagaha, which were in charge of Moggallána. Having asked the subject of conversation, he inquired whether the Buddha himself or the Order had chosen a leader for the Sangha after the Buddha's death. Ananda explains that the Buddha did not do so, that no special leader has been appointed, but that there were monks to whom they showed honour and reverence because of their virtue and insight. Vassakára admits this as good, as does also Upananda, the Senápati, who is present. Vassakára asks Ananda where he lives, and is told, in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt;. Vassakára thinks this a good place for the practice of jhána, and tells Ananda of a conversation he once had with the Buddha regarding jhána. Ananda, remarks that all jhánas are not equally praiseworthy, and Vassakára takes his leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.854) that Vassakára knew well of Ananda's residence at Veluvana, but that as the place was under his special protection, he wished to hear his work praised. Then follows a curious tale. Vassakára once saw &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')"&gt;Mahá Kaccána&lt;/a&gt; descending&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gijjhakuuta')"&gt;Gijjhakúta&lt;/a&gt; and remarked that he was just like a monkey. The Buddha, hearing of this, said that, unless Vassakára begged the Elder's forgiveness, he would be born as a monkey in Veluvana. Vassakára, feeling sure that the Buddha's prophecy would come true, had various fruit and other trees planted in Veluvana, to be of use to him as a monkey. After death he was actually reborn as a monkey and answered to the name of Vassakára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three conversations between the Buddha and Vassakára are recorded in the Anguttara Nikáya, all three taking place at Veluvana. See </data>
<data>&lt;a href="vassakaara_sutta')"&gt;Vassakára Suttas&lt;/a&gt; (1) and (2), and Suta Sutta ??. Another Sutta, also called Vassakára (3), repeats the conversation recorded in the Dígha regarding the possibility of Ajátasattu defeating the Vajjians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vassakára had a daughter whom he wished to give in marriage to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttara')"&gt;Uttara&lt;/a&gt;, but the latter refused the proposal as he wished to join the Order. Vassakára was angry, and contrived to take his revenge even after Uttara had become a monk (ThagA.i.240; see Uttara).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (Sp.ii.295) that Vassakára was envious by nature, and, on discovering that a certain forest official had given tribute to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhaniya')"&gt;Dhaniya&lt;/a&gt; (2) without the king's special leave, he reported the man to the king and had him punished (The incident is repeated at Vin.iii.42ff). In this context we find that Vassakára was Mahámatta (? prime minister) to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Vánarinda Játaka (No. 57)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a monkey living on a river bank. On his way from one bank to another, he used to jump off and on a rock in midstream, and a female crocodile, living in the river, longed to eat his heart and asked her husband to get it. So the crocodile lay on the rock, ready to catch the monkey as he jumped. The monkey noticing that, in spite of there being no tide, the rock was higher than usual, spoke to it and received no reply. His suspicions were then confirmed, and he said again, &quot;O rock, why don't you talk to me today ?&quot; The crocodile then revealed both his identity and his purpose, and the monkey resolved to outwit him. So he asked him to open his mouth, knowing that when a crocodile does this he shuts his eyes. So the crocodile did this, and the monkey jumped on to its back and from there to the other bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta’s attempt to kill the Buddha.

The horses drank and stood quietly in their stalls. There was a heap of leavings empty of all goodness, and the king ordered that these be kneaded with water, strained, and given to the donkeys who carried the horses' provender. The donkeys drank it, and galloped about braying loudly. The king asked his courtier (the Bodhisatta) the reason for this, and he answered that the lowborn lack self control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to some boys, attendants of devotees, at Sávatthi. The devotees themselves were calm and collected, but the boys would eat and then scamper about the banks of the Aciravatí, making great uproar. They are identified with the donkeys (J.ii.95f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.154f ) the story was related after the monks returned to Sávatthi from Verañjá. Their attendants had been quiet in Verañjá, where there was little to eat, but in Sávatthi they ate the remnants of the monks' food and made a great noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One of them once visited an arahant Thera in the Himálaya, and, revealing his identity, said that he could cause rain at will. The Elder wished to test this claim, but even before he could enter his hut the deva sang a song, raised his hand, and rain fell to a distance of three leagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are causes for rain: the power of nágas, of supannas, of devas, of an Act of Truth, of change of weather, of Mára, and of iddhi power.

The Buddha says that, even as a dirty piece of cloth takes dyes badly, so in an impure heart bliss is not to be found. He then proceeds to enumerate the heart's impurities and to show how they can be cleansed. Sundarika Bháradvája, who is present, asks the Buddha if he has bathed in the Báhuká. The Buddha then gives a list of places whose waters are considered holy, and declares that the real cleansing is the cleansing of the heart   &quot;to love all that lives, speak truth, slay not nor steal, no niggard be but dwell in faith.&quot; Bháradvája seeks ordination and becomes an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is evidently this sutta which is referred to in the Sumangalavilásiní (DA.i.50, 123), as the Vattha Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once, when on his way to see the Buddha at Gaggará Lake, he found he had arrived too early and went into the Paribbájakáráma near by. The Paribbájakas asked him if it was true that the Buddha ridicules all forms of asceticism and austerity. They spoke of the Buddha as a teacher of a discipline which he himself did not follow, a nihilist (venayika) and a visionary (? appaññattika). (For explanation of these terms, see AA.ii.854). Vajjiyamáhita refuted their arguments, maintaining that the Buddha declared what was good and what was bad, and that the truth of his teachings could be proved. Having thus silenced them, he sought the Buddha, to whom he repeated the conversation. The Buddha praised him, and said it was untrue that he discouraged all austerity and asceticism; such penances as led to the destruction of evil states and the promotion of good states, he welcomed and encouraged. When Vajjiyamáhita had left him, the Buddha held him up to the monks as an example of a good householder, capable of profitable discussion with followers of other persuasions.

Being aware of the permission granted by the Buddha to the monks who practiced the thirteen dhutahgas to visit him even during his periods of solitude, these monks would practice them for a short while and then visit him.

Some of the monks were frightened and suggested various methods for putting out the fire, while others said they should seek the Buddha's protection. This they did and the Buddha took them to a certain spot, where he halted. The flames came no nearer than sixteen lengths from where they were standing, and in approaching the spot extinguished themselves. When the monks marvelled at the great power of the Buddha, he told them the story of the past and said that, owing to his Act of Truth as a quail, that spot would never be harmed by flames during the whole of this kappa. J.i.212ff.; cp.i.172.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vattaka Játaka (No. 118).&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta was once born as a quail, and was caught by a fowler who sold birds after fattening them. The Bodhisatta, knowing this, starved himself, and when the fowler took him out of the cage to examine his condition the quail flew away and rejoined his companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a young man of Sávatthi called Uttarasetthiputta. He had descended from the Brahma world and had no desire for women. Once, during the Kattika festival, his friends sent him a gaily decked woman to entice him, but he gave her some money and sent her away. </data>
<data>As she came out of his house, a nobleman saw her and took her with him. When she failed to return, her mother complained to the king, and the setthiputta was told to restore her. On failing to do so, he was taken off for execution. He resolved that if by any means he could escape execution he would become a monk. The girl noticed the crowd following the young man, and on learning the reason she revealed her identity and he was set free. He, thereupon, joined the Order and soon after became an arahant. J.i.432ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vattaka Játaka (No. 394).&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta was once a forest quail living on rough grass and seeds. A greedy crow of Benares, who was in the forest, saw the quail and thought that the good condition of his body was due to rich food. The quail, seeing the crow, talked to him, and then the crow discovered that the quail had a beautiful body not because he ate rich food, but because he had contentment of mind and freedom from fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a greedy monk who is identified with the crow. J.iii.312f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vattaka Játaka.&lt;/b&gt; See also the Sammodamána Játaka, which is evidently also referred to as the Vattaka Játaka.

The Buddha says that, in his eyes, even pot scorings or dregs from cups thrown into a pool or cesspool, to feed the creatures living there, would be a source of merit. But gifts made to the good are more fruitful than those made to the wicked. The good are those who have abandoned lust, malevolence, sloth and torpor, excitement and-flurry and doubt and wavering.

When &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; asked for a Sákiyan girl in marriage, she was given to him. Mahá-náma went through the pretence of eating with her in order to allay Pasenadi's suspicions. It is said (J.iv.145) that Mahá-náma sat down to eat with her, but that as he was about to take the first mouthful, a messenger arrived, as prearranged, and brought him an urgent letter. He, thereupon, left the food uneaten in order to read the letter, and asked Vásabhakkhattiyá to finish her meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/viduudabha')"&gt;Vidúdabha&lt;/a&gt; was the son ofVásabhakkhattiyá.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vajjí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a country and of its people. It was one of the sixteen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada')"&gt;Mahájanapadas&lt;/a&gt;. The inhabitants appear to have consisted of several confederate clans of whom the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi')"&gt;Licchaví&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/videha')"&gt;Videhá&lt;/a&gt; were the chief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passage in the Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.519) -  which states that among those responsible for the administration of justice in the Vajji country (see Licchaví) were the Atthakulaká -  has given rise to the conjecture that Atthakulaká meant heads of eight clans composing the Vajjian confederacy. There is no other evidence regarding the number of the clans. The Atthakulaká were probably a judicial committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time went on the Licchaví became the most powerful of these clans (Licchaví Vajjiratthavásíhi pasatthá) (E.g., MA.i.394), and the names Vajjí and Licchaví were often synonymous. See Licchaví; in the Trikandasesa, quoted by Cunningham (AGI. 509), Licchavi, Vaideha and Tirabhukti were synonymous. In one passage (A.iii.76) the Licchavi, Mahánáma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is represented as saying, &quot;These Licchavis will yet become Vajjians&quot; (bhavissanti Yajjí). This probably only means that there was great hope of these young men becoming true Vaijians, practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the Buddha, conditions which ensured their prosperity. But see G. S.iii.62, n.1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt; was the capital of the Licchavis and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mithilaa')"&gt;Mithilá&lt;/a&gt; of the Videhas. In the time of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, both Vesáli and Mithilá were republics, </data>
<data>though Mithilá had earlier been a kingdom under Janaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of the Buddha, and even up to his death, the Vajjians were a very prosperous and happy community. The Buddha attributed this to the fact that they practiced the seven conditions of welfare taught to them by himself in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarandada')"&gt;Sárandada Cetiya&lt;/a&gt;. The details of this teaching, and various other matters connected with the Vajji, are given under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi')"&gt;Licchaví&lt;/a&gt;. But soon after the Buddha's death, (three years after the Buddha's last visit to Vesáli, according to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt;, DA.ii.522) &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of his minister &lt;a href="vassakaara')"&gt;Vassakára&lt;/a&gt;, sowed dissension among the Vajjians and conquered their territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha travelled several times through the Vajjian country, the usual route being through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallaa')"&gt;Malla&lt;/a&gt;, Vajji, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaasi')"&gt;Kási&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;, and thus back (See, e.g., S.v.348), and he preached to the people, mostly in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa')"&gt;Kútágárasálá&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt;. Among other places besides Vesáli visited by the Buddha, are mentioned &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ukkaacelaa')"&gt;Ukkácelá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kotigaama')"&gt;Kotigáma&lt;/a&gt; (see, e.g., J.ii.232, where it is called a village of the Vajjians, on the Ganges), Nádiká (in which were Giñjakávasatha and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gosingasaala')"&gt;Gosingasálavana&lt;/a&gt;), Beluvagáma (or Veluvagáma), Bhandagáma, Bhogagáma and Hatthigáma. Pubbavijjhana, the birthplace of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt;, is also mentioned as a </data>
<data>village of the Vajjians (S.iv.59). The Vaggumudá river flowed through Vajjian territory (Ud.iii.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one context (UdA., p. 382) Dhammapála describes Udena as Vajjirájá. This is probably a mistake, for nowhere is Udena, who was king of the Vatsas (or Vamsas), called the king of the Vajjis. The Vajjí are mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanaradakassapa_jat_544')"&gt;Mahánáradakassapa Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. It is significant that the first great schism in the Buddhist Order arose in Vajji, when the &lt;a href="vajjiputtakaa')"&gt;Vajjiputtaká&lt;/a&gt; brought forward their Ten Points. Even during the Buddha's lifetime some monks of Vajji joined &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.ii.199f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt;, (Beal: op. cit., 77) who visited it, the Vajji (Vriji) country was broad from east to west and narrow from north to south. The people of the neighbouring countries were called Samvajji, or United Vajjis. For details see Cunningham, AGI. 512ff.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries contain a mythical account of the origin of the name Vajjí.

One day he sent the pupils into a forest to gather wood, but one of them was lazy and went to sleep, and when his companions woke him he climbed on to a tree and broke off some green branches. One of the boughs hit him in the eye and wounded him. The next day the pupils had been invited to a meal in a distant village and a servant girl was told to make them some gruel early, before their start. She lit a fire with the green wood which lay on the top of the firewood, and the fire would not burn. The green wood had been thrown there last by the lazy pupil who had been the last to return. The pupils could not start in time and the journey had to be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kutumbiyaputta')"&gt;Kutumbikaputta Tissa&lt;/a&gt;, with whom the brahmin youth is identified.

He had a very beautiful daughter, called &lt;a href="maagandiyaa')"&gt;Mágandiyá&lt;/a&gt;. Many men of high station sought her hand, but the brahmin did not consider them worthy. The Buddha, one day, became aware that both Mágandiya and his wife were ready for conversion, so he visited their village. Mágandiya saw him, and, noting the auspicious marks on his body, told him of his daughter and begged him to wait till she could be brought. The Buddha said nothing, and Mágandiya went home and returned with his wife and daughter arrayed in all splendours. On arriving, they found the Buddha had gone, but his footprint was visible, and Mágandiya's wife, skilled in such matters, said that the owner of such a footprint was free from all passion. But Mágandiya paid no attention, and, going a little way, saw the Buddha and offered him his daughter. The Buddha thereupon told them of his past life, his renunciation of the world, his conquest of Mára, and the unsuccessful attempts of Mára's very beautiful daughters to tempt him. Compared with them, Mágandiya was, he said, a corpse, filled with thirty two impurities, an impure vessel painted without; he would not touch her with his foot. At the end of the discourse, Mágandiya and his wife became anágámins. DhA.iii.193ff.; SNA.ii.542f.; cp. Dvy.515ff., where the name is given as Mákandika and he is called a parivrájaka.

DhA.i.202&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.235f), Mágandiya's village was Kammásadamma, and the Buddha went there on his journey </data>
<data>to Kosambí at the invitation of Ghosita, Kukkuta and Pávárika. He turned off the main road to visit Mágandiya.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Mágandiya (2), Mágandiya Sutta, and Mágandiyapañha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mágandiya.&lt;/b&gt; A Paribbájaka. The Buddha was once staying in the fire hut of the brahmin Bháradvájaggotta at Kammásadamma and Mágandiya came to the hut. Seeing the grass mat on which the Buddha slept at night, he inquired whose it was, and, on being told, he was very annoyed, calling the Buddha a rigid repressionist (bhunahu). Bháradvája protested, whereupon Mágandiya offered to repeat his charge to the Buddha's face. The Buddha, aware of this conversation, entered the hut in the evening and had a discussion with Mágandiya, who ended by joining the Order, later becoming an arahant. M.i.502ff.; Mil.313.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (MA.ii.681) that this Mágandiya was the nephew of Mágandiya (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mágandiyá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter of the brahmin &lt;a href="maagandiya')"&gt;Mágandiya&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; rejected her father's offer of marriage with her, her parents joined the Order, giving her in charge of her uncle, Culla Mágandiya. The latter took her to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambí&lt;/a&gt;, who made her his chief consort, giving her five hundred ladies in waiting. Mágandiyá was incensed against the Buddha for having called her a &quot;vessel of filth,&quot; and, when he came to Kosambí, she planned her revenge. Having discovered that Udena's other queen, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samavati')"&gt;Sámávatí&lt;/a&gt;, and her companions were in the habit of watching for the Buddha through windows in the walls of their rooms, she told the king that Sámávatí and her friends were conspiring to kill him. For some time the king refused to believe this, but when the holes were shown to him, he had them closed up and the windows built higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plan having failed, Mágandiyá hired a slave to revile and abuse the Buddha in the streets. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; suggested to the Buddha that they should go elsewhere. The Buddha answered, &quot;I am like the elephant who has entered the fray, I must endure the darts that come upon me. After seven days the abuse ceased. Mágandiyá then persuaded her uncle to send eight live cocks to the palace and sent a page with them to the king's drinking place. When the king asked what should be done with them, she suggested that Sámávatí and her friends should be asked to cook them for him. This the king agreed to do, but the women refused to deprive an animal of its life. Mágandiyá said they should be tested, </data>
<data>and sent word by the page that the cocks were to be cooked for the Buddha. The page was bribed to change the live cocks for dead ones on the way, and Sámávatí and her companions then cooked them and sent them to the Buddha. But even then the king, though not knowing of the exchange, would not be convinced of Sámávatí's disloyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mágandiyá then obtained a snake from her uncle with its fangs removed. This she inserted in the shell of the flute which Udena carried about, closing the hole with a bunch of flowers. Udena was in the habit of spending a week in turn with each of his three consorts. When he announced his intention of going to Sámávatí, Mágandiyá begged of him not to go, saying she had had a dream and feared for his safety. But the king went and Mágandiyá went with him. As he lay asleep with the lute under his pillow she pulled out the bunch of flowers, and the snake lay coiled on his pillow. Mágandiyá screamed and accused Sámávatí of designs on the king's life. This time Udena believed her, and placing Sámávati and her friends in a line one behind the other, he sent for his bow, which could only be strung by one thousand men, and shot an arrow at Sámávatí's breast. But by the power of her goodness the arrow failed to pierce her. Convinced of her innocence, the king pleaded for her forgiveness and gave her a boon. She chose that the Buddha should be invited to come to the palace every day, but the Buddha would not accept the invitation and sent Ananda in his place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once more Mágandiyá conspired with her uncle against Sámávatí. They had all the pillars of Sámávatí's house wrapt in cloth, soaked in oil, and, when she and her women were inside, the house was set fire to. Sámávatí saw the flames spreading and exhorted her women to be self possessed, and they attained to various fruits of the Path. Udena questioned Mágandiyá very </data>
<data>carefully, and became convinced of her share and that of her uncle in the crime. He then sent for all Mágandiya's relations saying that he wished to reward them. He buried them waist-deep in the palace grounds and covered them with straw; the straw was then set fire to, and when it was burnt he had their bodies ploughed with an iron plough. Pieces of flesh were ripped from Mágandiyá's body, fried like cakes in oil, and Mágandiyá was then forced to eat them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DhA.i.201f., 210ff.; UdA.383f.; cf. Dvy., 515ff., where Mágandiyá is called Anúpamá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mátanga Játaka (No. 497)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born in a Candála village outside Benares and was named Mátanga. One day, when Ditthamangaliká, the daughter of a rich merchant, was on her way to the park with a group of friends, she saw Mátanga coming towards the city, and thinking the sight inauspicious, washed her eyes with perfumed water and turned back home. Her companions, annoyed at being deprived of their fun, beat Mátanga and left him senseless. On recovering consciousness, he determined to get Ditthamangaliká as wife and lay down outside her father's house refusing to move. Seven days he lay thus until her relations, fearing the ignominy of having a candála die at their door, gave Ditthamangaliká to him as wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing her pride to be quelled by this act, Mátanga decided to bring her great honour. He, therefore, retired into the forest and in seven days, won supernatural power. On his return he told her to proclaim abroad that her husband was not a candála but Mahábrahmá, and that seven days later, on the night of the full moon, he would come to her, breaking through the moon's disk. She did as he said and so it happened. The people thenceforth honoured her as a goddess; the water in which she washed her feet was used for the coronation of kings, and in one single day she received eighteen crores from those who were allowed the privilege of saluting her. Mátanga touched her navel with his thumb, and, knowing that she had conceived a son, admonished her to be vigilant and returned to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son was born in the pavilion, which the people had constructed for the use of Ditthamangaliká, and was therefore called Mandavya,. At the age of sixteen he knew all the Vedas and fed sixteen thousand brahmins daily. On a feast day Mátanga came to him, thinking to turn him from his wrong </data>
<data>doctrines, but Mandavya failed to recognize him and had him cast out by his servants, Bhandakucchi, Upajjháya, and Upajotiya. The gods of the city thereupon grew angry and twisted the necks of Mandavya and all the brahmins so that their eyes looked over their shoulders. When Ditthamangaliká heard of this she sought Mátanga, who had left his footsteps so that she might know where he was. He asked her to sprinkle on the brahmins water in which were dissolved the leavings of his food; to Mandavya himself was given some of the food. On recovering and seeing the plight of the brahmins, he realized his error. The brahmins recovered, but were shunned by their colleagues; they left the country and went to live in the kingdom of Mejjha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bank of the Vettavatí lived a brahmin called Játimanta, very proud of his birth. Mátanga went thither to humble the pride of Játimanta and lived higher up stream. One day he nibbled a tooth stick and threw it into the river, where, lower down, it got entangled in Játimanta's hair. He was greatly annoyed and went up stream, where he found Mátanga and told him that, if he stayed there any longer, at the end of seven days his head would split into seven pieces. On the seventh day Mátanga stopped the sun from rising. On discovering the cause, the people dragged Játimanta to Mátanga and made him ask forgiveness, falling at Mátanga's feet. Játimanta's head was covered with a lump of clay, which was immersed in the water as the sun rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mátanga then went to the kingdom of Mejjha, where the exiled brahmins reported against him to the king, saying that he was a juggler and a mountebank. The king's messengers surprised Mátanga as he was eating his food beside a well, and cut off his head. He was born in the Brahma world. The gods were angry and wiped out the whole kingdom of Mejjha by pouring on it </data>
<data>torrents of hot ashes. Before his meeting with Ditthamangaliká the Bodhisatta was a mongoose tamer (kondadamaka). But in SNA.i.186, he is called a sopákajívika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the attempt of King Udena (q.i) to torture Pindolabháradvája. Udena is identified with Mandavya. J.iv.375 90; the story is found also at SNA.i.184 93, with alterations in certain details   e.g., for Vettavatí we have Bandhumatí; see also Mil.123ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day Manoja, in spite of his father's warnings, made friends with a jackal called Giriya. Acting on Giriya’s suggestion, Manoja went in search of horse flesh and attacked the king's horses, The king engaged the services of an archer, who shot Manoja as he was making off with a horse. Manoja managed to reach his den, but there he fell down dead (J.iii.321ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circumstances in which the story was related are similar to those of the Mahilámukha Játaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

For a slightly different version see DhA.i.264ff. Because of his birth as Magha, Sakka came to be known as Maghavá. Maghavá was, perhaps, not the personal name of any particular Sakka, but a title of all Sakkas, because the Sakka who was the real Magha is identified with the Bodhisatta (J.i.207), while the Buddha says (S.i.231; DhA.i.264) that the Sakka, who visited him, and whose conversation is recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, was also known as Maghavá. The title probably originated from the time when Magha became Sakka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.267; this is supported by the story as given in DA.iii.710 ff. and DhA.i.264ff., where no mention is made of the Bodhisatta), however, says that Magha was not the Bodhistatta, but that his life was like that of a Bodhisatta (Bodhisattacariyá viyassa cariyá ahosi); in which case the name Maghavá belongs only to the present Sakka. Magha took upon himself seven vows (vatapadáni), which brought him birth as Sakka: to maintain his parents, to revere his elders, to use gentle language, to utter no slander, to be free from avarice, to practise generosity and open handed </data>
<data>liberality and kindness, to speak the truth, to be free from anger (S.i.227f.; SA.i.267).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this and other titles of Sakka, see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Madhurá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Madhurá. &lt;/b&gt;The capital of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/surasena')"&gt;Surasena&lt;/a&gt;, situated on the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamunaa')"&gt;Yamuná&lt;/a&gt;. Its king, soon after the death of Bimbisára, was Avantiputta (M.ii.83), who, judging by his name, was probably related to the royal family of Ujjeni. Madhurá was visited by the Buddha (A.ii.57; iii.256), but there is no record of his having stayed there. In fact, the Madhura Sutta (2) (q.v.) states that he viewed the city with distinct disfavour. But Mahá Kaccána evidently liked it, for he stayed there in the Gundávana, and was visited there by the king of the city, Avantiputta (M.ii.83), and the brahmin Kandaráyana (A.i.67). One of the most important suttas on caste, the &lt;a href="madhura_s')"&gt;Madhura Sutta 1&lt;/a&gt;, was preached to Avantiputta by Mahá Kaccána at Madhurá. Perhaps it was through the agency of Mahá Kaccána that Buddhism gained ground in Madhurá. Already in the Buddha's time there were, in and around Madhurá, those who accepted his teachings, for the Anguttara Nikáya (A.ii.57) mentions that once when he was journeying from Madhurá to Verañjá and stopped under a tree by the wayside, a large number of householders, both men and women, came and worshipped him. Later, about 300 B.C., Madhurá became a Jain centre (CHI.i.167), but when Fa Hsien (Giles, p. 20) and Hiouen Thsang visited it, Buddhism was flourishing there, and there were many sanghárámas and stúpas. Beal.i.179ff.; for a prophecy (attributed to the Buddha) regarding the future greatness of Madhurá, see Dvy.348ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Sankassa to Madhurá was a distance of four yojanas (thus in Kaccáyana's Grammar, iii.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madhurá is sometimes referred to as Uttara Madhurá, to distinguish it from a city of the same name in South India. Thus, in the </data>
<data>Vimánavatthu Commentary (VvA.118f), a woman of Uttara Madhurá is mentioned as having been born in Távatimsa as a result of having given alms to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ghata Játaka (J.iv.79ff) speaks of Maháságara as the king of Uttara&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt; Madhurá, and relates what is evidently the story of Kamsa’s attempt to tyrannize over Madhurá by overpowering the Yádavas and his consequent death at the hands of Krsna, a story which is found both in the Epics and in the Puránas. This Játaka confirms the Brahmanical tradition as to the association of Vasudeva's family with Madhurá (PHAL, p. 89).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a story (Cv.xcii.23ff ) of a king called Mahásena of Pátaliputta, who was very generous in feeding the monks, and once thought of giving alms by cultivating a piece of land himself. He, therefore, went to Uttara Madhurá in disguise, worked as a labourer, and held an almsgiving with the gains so obtained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madhurá is generally identified with Maholi, five miles to the Southeast of the present town of Mathurá or Muttra. It is the Modura of Ptolemy and the Methoras of Pliny (CAGI. 427f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milindapañha (p. 331) refers to Madhurá as one of the chief cities of India. In the past, Sádhina and twenty two of his descendants, the last of whom was Dhammagutta, reigned in Madhurá (Dpv.iii.21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Madhurá. &lt;/b&gt;A city in South India, in the Madras Presidency, and now known as Madura. It is generally referred to as Dakkhina-Madhurá, to distinguish it from (Uttara-)Madhura on the Yamuná. Dakkhina-Madhurá was the second capital of the Pandyan kingdom (their first being Korkai, see Vincent Smith, EHI.335ff), and there was constant intercourse between this city and Ceylon. From Madhurá came the consort of Vijaya, first king of Ceylon, and she was accompanied by many maidens of various families who </data>
<data>settled in Ceylon (Mhv.vii.49ff). Sena II. sent an army to pillage Madhurá, and set upon the throne a Pandu prince who had begged for his support (Cv.li.27ff). Later, Madhurá was attacked by Kulasekhara, and its king, Parakkama, sought the assistance of Parakkamabáhu I. of Ceylon. The latter sent an army under his general Lankápura, but in the meantime the Pándyan king had been slain and his capital taken. The Singhalese army, however, landed on the opposite coast and carried on a war against the Colas, and built a fortress near Rámnád, which they called Parakkamapura. They managed to defeat Kulasekhara and restore the crown of Madhurá to the Pándyan king's son, Víra Pandu. The captives taken by the army were sent to Ceylon. For details see Cv.lxxvi.76ff.; lxxvii.1ff.; see also Cv.Trs.ii.100, n. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rájasíha II. is said to have obtained wives from Madhurá (Cv.xcvi.40), as did his successors Vimaladhammasúriya II., Narindasíha and Vijayarájasíha.

For successive periods of eighty four thousand years each he had respectively amused himself as prince, ruled as viceroy, and reigned as king. He one day asked his barber to tell him as soon as he had any grey hairs. When, many years later, the barber found a grey hair, he pulled it out and laid it on the king's palm as he had been requested. The king had eighty-four thousand years yet to live, but he granted the barber a village yielding one hundred thousand, and, on that very day, gave over the kingdom to his son and renounced the world as though he had seen the King of Death. For eighty four thousand years he lived as a recluse in the Makhádeva-ambavana and was reborn in the Brahma world. Later, he became once more king of Mithilá under the name of Nimi, and in that life, too, he became a recluse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barber is identified with Ananda and the son with Ráhula. The story was related to some monks who were talking one day about the Buddha's Renunciation. J.i.137ff.; cp. M.ii.74ff., and J.vi.95. See Thomas: op. cit., 127.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

E.g., J.iv.327; Cv.lxxvi.195.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Malaya.&lt;/b&gt; The mountainous country of Ceylon, originally the home of the Pulindá (Mhv.vii.68; see Mhv.Trs.60, n. 5). When Dutthagámaní fled from his father's wrath, it was in Malaya that he hid (Mhv.xxiv.7). In Malaya was the Ambatthakolalena, from which Dutthagámaní obtained silver for the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxviii.20). The hill country provided protection from marauders who invaded Ceylon (E.g., in the case of Vattagámaní; Mhv.xxxiii.62; also xxxv.26), and also from those causing danger to the rightful ruler (E.g., ibid., xxxvi.50; Cv.xli.20; l.20). When Buddhism was threatened by the activities of unbelievers who had obtained possession of Anurádhapura, it was to Malaya and to Rohana that the monks fled in order to save themselves and their teaching (E.g., Mhv.xxxvii.6). Malaya also afforded shelter to rebels against the government both during preparations for attack and, if necessary, during their flight (E.g., Cv.xli.10; xliv.62; xlviii.98; li.112f.; lvii.47, 57).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later times Malaya was treated as a special province, and was in charge of an official called Malayarája, who was generally the king's younger son, the elder being viceroy in charge of the Eastern Province (Pácínadesa). The district of Dakkhinadesa was included in Malaya (See Cv.xli.33ff.; lii.68; Cv. Trs.i.54, n.4; but see Cv.xlii.6, 10; xliv.43 li.13; liii.36), but it was later separated (Cv.li.8). The Yuvarája himself was sometimes Malayarájá, particularly when the other provinces were in the hands of enemies (E.g., Cv.lviii.7). Mention is also made (Cv.lxix.6) of a Malayarájá who was in charge of a Damila army (probably of mercenaries). In times of war the people of Malaya </data>
<data>usually gave a great deal of trouble as the country was difficult of access (E.g., Cv.lxx.30). Some of the villages in Malaya were composed of only one house.

DA.ii.365) says it was called Samyappavádaka because teachers holding various views used to gather there and discourse on their doctrines. It was surrounded by tindukakhíra (timbaru) trees, hence tindukácíra (sic); at first it possessed only one hall, but later many were erected through the good fortune of Potthapáda -  hence its epithet Ekasáláka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Malliká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Malliká.&lt;/b&gt; Chief queen of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;, king of Kosala. She was the daughter of the chief garland maker of Kosala, and was very good and beautiful. When she was sixteen she was, one day, on her way to the garden with some companions, carrying with her three portions of sour gruel in a basket. Meeting the Buddha, she offered them to him and worshipped him. The Buddha, seeing her wrapt in joy, smiled, and, in answer to Ananda's question, said she would be chief queen of Kosala that very day. J.iii.405; SA.i.110ff. It was to explain Malliká's good fortune that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kummaasapinda_jat_416')"&gt;Kummásapinda Játaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happened that Pasenadi, having suffered defeat at the hands of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt; that very day, was passing by and entered the flower garden, attracted by Malliká's voice. Malliká, seeing him coming, and noting his weariness, seized his horse's bridle. The king, discovering that she was unmarried, dismounted, and, having rested awhile, his head on her lap, entered the town with her and took her to her own house. In the evening he sent a chariot for her, and with great honour and pomp brought her from her own home, set her on a heap of jewels and anointed her chief queen. From that day onward she was the beloved and devoted wife of the king and an undeviating follower of the Buddha (DhA.iii.121f). The king found her sagacious and practical minded and consulted her and accepted her advice when in difficulty -  e.g., in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana')"&gt;Asadisa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana')"&gt;-dána&lt;/a&gt;, wherein he wished to excel his subjects, and again when he was troubled by evil dreams as narrated </data>
<data>in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasupina_jat_077')"&gt;Mahásupína Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. DhA.ii.8ff. says that Malliká called the king a simpleton for putting his faith in brahmins and took him to the Buddha, and while the king sat trembling, asked the questions for him and had them explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka states how Malliká saved many innocent lives from being sacrificed, and the Buddha declared that in a past life too, as Dinná (q.v.), she had saved the lives of a large number of people by her wisdom (DhA.ii.15f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Malliká and Pasenadi's other queen, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa')"&gt;Vásabhakhattiyá&lt;/a&gt;, desired to learn the Dhamma, and, at their request conveyed through Pasenadi, the Buddha asked Ananda to visit the palace regularly and teach them the Doctrine. Ananda found in Malliká an apt and ready pupil, conscientious in her work; Vásabhakhattiyá was not so devoted to her duties. DhA.i.382f.   For an incident connected with Ananda's visit to the palace, see Vin.iv.158f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallika's knowledge of the Dhamma made her wiser than Pasenadi would have desired, and he once, in a moment of great affection, asked if anyone were dearer to her than her own &quot;self.&quot; &quot;No, Sire,&quot; was the answer; the king was evidently greatly disappointed, for he sought the Buddha, who explained to him that Malliká, in making that answer, had uttered a great truth (S.i.75; Ud.v.1). Malliká, though an exemplary wife, was not without lapses. Reference is made to the quarrels she had with her husband, once, at least, on the question of conjugal rights, as a result of which they both sulked and had to be reconciled by the Buddha. J.iv.437; also J.iii.20; in these quarrels the king was probably more to blame than Malliká; it is said that until reconciled by the Buddha he ignored her very existence, saying that prosperity had turned </data>
<data>her head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.119ff) relates a ridiculous story about her misbehaviour with a dog in the bath house. Pasenadi was a witness of this scene, but she was able to convince him that it was the fault of the lighting of the bath house. Nevertheless, it is said that at the moment of her death she recollected this misdeed, and, as a result, was reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aviici')"&gt;Avíci&lt;/a&gt;. The king was overcome by grief at Mallika's death, and, after the funeral rites, went to the Buddha to ask where she had been reborn. The Buddha, not wishing him to know, caused the king to forget the question, every time he came to the vihára, for a whole week, till Malliká's suffering in Avíci was over; then he allowed the question to be asked, and he was able to assure Pasenadi that she had been reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tusita')"&gt;Tusita&lt;/a&gt; and to console him in his grief. It is said (A.iii.57) that Pasenadi was on a visit to the Buddha when a man came with the whispered message that the queen was dead. It was a terrible shock, &quot;his shoulders drooped, his mouth fell, and he sat brooding, unable to speak.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malliká had a daughter by Pasenadi; no mention is made of a son. Probably &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajiraakumaarii')"&gt;Vajírí&lt;/a&gt;, who is spoken of as the king's only daughter (M.ii.110). He is said to have been disappointed on hearing that the child was a girl; but the Buddha assured him that women were sometimes wiser than men (S.i.86f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malliká is mentioned (Mil. 115, 291) as one of seven persons whose acts of devotion bore fruit in this life and whose fame reached even to the gods. Only one instance is on record of Malliká asking a question of the Buddha. She wished to know why some women are plain, others beautiful, some rich, and others poor. And the Buddha explained to her the reasons for these </data>
<data>discrepancies (See &lt;a href="mallikaa_s')"&gt;Malliká Sutta 1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/piyajatika_sutta')"&gt;Piyajátika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.106ff ) Pasenadi is said to have taunted her because &quot;her recluse Gotama&quot; had said that dear ones bring sorrow and tribulation. &quot;If the Lord says so, it must be so,&quot; she replies; but secretly sends Nálijangha to find out from the Buddha himself if he had said so and why. Having learnt the facts, she faces Pasenadi again, and convinced him too that the Buddha is right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malliká had a garden, called the Mallikáráma, in which was a Hall among the Deispyros trees (tindukácíra) set apart for religious discussions between members of various sects (samayappavádaka). M.ii.22; MA.710; D.i.178; see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekasaalaa')"&gt;Ekasálá&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malliká is identified with  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sujátá of the   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaata_jat_269_306_352')"&gt;Sujáta Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.22),  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Kinnarí in the   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhallatiya_jat_504')"&gt;Bhallátiya Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.444)   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;and Sambulá in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sambula_jat_519')"&gt;Sambula Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.98). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all three births Pasenadi was her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malliká is included in a list of eminent upásikás (A.iv.348).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Magadha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the four chief kingdoms of India at the time of the Buddha, the others being Kosala, the kingdom of the Vamsas and Avanti. Magadha formed one of the sixteen Mahájanapadas and had its capital at Rájagaha or Giribbaja where Bimbisára, and after him Ajátasattu, reigned. Later, Pátaliputta became the capital. By the time of Bimbisára, Anga, too, formed a part of Magadha, and he was known as king of Anga Magadha (see, e.g., Vin.i.27 and ThagA.i.544, where Bimbisára sends for Sona Kolivisa, a prominent citizen of Campá, capital of Anga). But prior to that, these were two separate kingdoms, often at war with each other (e.g., J.iv.454f). Several kings of Magadha are mentioned by name in the Játakas -  e.g., Arindama and Duyyodhana. In one story (J.vi.272) the Magadha kingdom is said to have been under the suzerainty of Anga. In the Buddha's day, Magadha (inclusive of Anga) consisted of eighty thousand villages (Vin.i.179) and had a circumference of some three hundred leagues (DA.i.148).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajátasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books (e.g., D.ii.73f., 86).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Bimbisára and Ajátasattu, Magadha rose to such political eminence that for several centuries, right down to the time of Asoka, the history of Northern India was practically the history of Magadha. (A list of the kings from Bimbisára to Asoka is found in Dvy.369 ; cp. DA.i.153; Mbv.96, 98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Magadha was bounded on the east by the river Campá (Campá flowed between Anga and Magadha; J.iv.454), on the south by the Vindhyá Mountains, on the west by the river Sona, </data>
<data>and on the north by the Ganges. The latter river formed the boundary between Magadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the Mágadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river. When the Buddha visited Vesáli, Bimbisára made a road five leagues long, from Rájagaha to the river, and decorated it, and the Licchavis did the same on the other side. DhA.iii.439 f.; the Dvy. (1p.55) says that monks going from Sávatthi to Rájagaha could cross the Ganges in boats kept either by Ajátasattu or by the Licchavis of Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the early Buddhist period Magadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning. The kings of Magadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbisára and Pasenadi marrying each other's sisters. Mention is made of an alliance between Pukkusáti, king of Gandhára and Bimbisára. When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbisára sent him his own personal physician, Jívaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Magadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampatí in Vin.i.5, pátur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo, etc.), and it was from Magadha that it spread after the Third Council. The Buddha's chief disciples, Sáriputta and Moggallána, came from Magadha. In Asoka's time the income from the four gates of his capital of Pátaliputta was four hundred thousand kahápanas daily, and in the Sabhá, or Council, he would daily receive another hundred thousand kahápanas (Sp.i.52). The cornfields of Magadha were rich and fertile (Thag.vs.208), and each Magadha field was about one gávuta in extent. Thus AA.ii.616 explains the extent of Kakudha's body, which filled two or three Mágadha village fields (A.iii.122).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The names of several places in Magadha occur in the books</data>
<data>-  e.g., Ekanálá, NáIakagáma, Senánigáma, Khánumata, Andhakavindha, Macala, Mátulá, Ambalatthiká, Pátaligáma, NáIandá and SáIindiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.135 f ) that there are many fanciful explanations (bahudhá papañcanti) of the word Magadha. One such is that king Cetiya, when about to be swallowed up by the earth for having introduced lying into the world, was thus admonished by those standing round -  &quot;Má gadham pavisa;” another that those who were digging in the earth saw the king, and that he said to them: &quot; Má gadham karotha.&quot; The real explanation, accepted by Buddhaghosa himself, seems to have been that the country was the residence of a tribe of khattiyas called Magadhá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Magadhabhásá is regarded as the speech of the Áriyans (e.g., Sp.i.255). If children grow up without being taught any language, they will spontaneously use the Magadha language; it is spread all over Niraya, among lower animals, petas, humans and devas (VibhA.387f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Anga and Magadha were in the habit of holding a great annual sacrifice to Máha Brahmá in which a fire was kindled with sixty cartloads of firewood. They held the view that anything cast into the sacrificial fire would bring a thousand fold reward. SA.i.269; but it is curious that in Vedic, Bráhmana and Sútra periods, Magadha was considered as outside the pale of Ariyan and Brahmanical culture, and was therefore looked down upon by Brahmanical writers. But it was the holy land of the Buddhists. See VT.ii.207; Thomas: op. cit., 13, 96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magadha was famous for a special kind of garlic (Sp.iv.920) and the Magadha nála was a standard of measure. (E.g., AA.i.101).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magadha is identified with the modern South Behar. See also &lt;a href="magadhakhetta')"&gt;Magadhakhetta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

Later, he heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order, becoming an Arahant (ThagA.i.446f). The Theragáthá contains two sets of verses attributed to him: one (vv. 399 404) spoken on his visit to his home after attaining arahantship when his people tried to lure him back by a great display of hospitality; the other* in connection with a brief sermon preached to him by the Buddha before he became an Arahant.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally regarded as the personification of Death, the Evil One, the Tempter (the Buddhist counterpart of the Devil or Principle of Destruction). The legends concerning Mára are, in the books, very involved and defy any attempts at unravelling them. In the latest accounts, mention is made of five Máras   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Khandha Mára, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Kilesa Mára, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Abhisankhára Mára, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Maccu Mára and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Devaputta Mára   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;as shown in the following quotations: pañcannam pi Máránam vijayato jino (ThagA.ii.16); sabbámittehi khandha-kilesá-bhisankháramaccudeva-puttasankháte, sabbapaccatthike (ThagA.ii.46); sankhepato vá pañcakilesa-khandhábhi-sankhára-devaputta-maccumáre abhañji, tasmá . . . bhagavá ti vuccati (Vsm.211). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, however, Mára is spoken of as one, three, or four. Where Mára is one, the reference is generally either to the kilesas or to Death. Thus: Márenáti kilesamárena (ItvA.197); Márassa visaye ti kilesamárassa visaye (ThagA.ii.70); jetvána maccuno senam vimokkhena anávaran ti lokattayábhibyápanato diyaddhasahassádi vibhágato ca vipulattá aññehi aváritum patisedhetum asakkuneyyattá ca maccuno, Márassa, senam vimokkhena ariyamaggena jetvá (ItvA.198); Márásená ti ettha satte anatthe niyojento máretíti Máro (UdA.325); nihato Máro bodhimúle ti vihato samucchinno kilesamáro bodhirukkhamúle (Netti Cty. 235); vasam Márassa gacchatíti kilesamárassa ca sattamárassa (?) ca vasam gacchi (Netti, p. 86); tato sukhmnataram Márabandhanan ti kilesabandhanam pan' etam tato sukhumataram (SA.iii.82); Máro máro ti maranam pucchati, máradhammo ti maranadhammo (SA.ii.246).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is evidently with this same significance that the term </data>
<data>Mára, in the older books, is applied to the whole of the worldly existence, the five khandhas, or the realm of rebirth, as opposed to Nibbána. Thus Mára is defined at CNid. (No. 506) as kammábhisankháravasena patisandhiko kandhamáro dhátumáro, áyatanamáro. And again: Máro Máro ti bhante vuccati katamo nu kho bhante Máro ti? Rúpam kho, Rádha, Máro, vedanámáro, saññámáro, sankháramáro viññánam Máro (S.iii.195); yo kho Rádha Máro tatra chando pahátabbo. Ko ca Rádha Máro? Rúpam kho Rádha Máro . . . pe . . . vedanámáro. Tatra kho Rádha chando pahátabbo (S.iii.198); sa upádiyamáno kho bhikku baddho Márassa, anupadiyamáno mutto pápimáto (S.iii.74); evam sukhumam kho bhikkhave, Vepacittibandhanam; tato sukhumataram márabandhanam; maññamáno kho bhikkhave baddho Márassa, amaññamáno mutto pápimato (S.iv.202); labhati Máro otáram, labhati Máro árammanam (S.iv.85); santi bhikkhave cakkhuviññeyyarúpá ... pe . . . tañ ce bhikkhu abhinandati . . . pe . . . ayam vuccati bhikkhave bhikkhu ávásagato Márassa, Márassa vasam, gato (S.iv.91); dhunátha maccuno senam nalágáram va kuñjaro ti paññindriyassa padathánam (Netti, p. 40); rúpe kho Rádha sati Máro vá assa máretá vá yo vá pana míyati. Tasmá he tvam Rádha rúpam máro ti passa máretá ti passa míyatíti passa ... ye nam evam passanti te sammá passanti (S.iii.189); Márasamyogan ti tebhúmakavattam (SNA.ii.506).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries also speak of three Máras: bodhipallanke tinnam Máránam matthakam bhinditvá (DA.ii.659); aparájitasanghan ti ajj' eva tayo Máre madditvá vijitasangánam matthakam madditvá anuttaram sammásambodhim abhisambuddho (CNidA. p. 47). In some cases the three Máras are specified: yathayidam bhikkhave márabalan ti yathá idam devaputtamára maccumára kilesamáránam balam appasaham durabhisambhavam (DA.iii.858); maccuháyino ti maranamaccu kilesamccu devaputtamaccu háyino, tividham pi tam maccum hitvá </data>
<data>gámino ti vuttam hoti (SNA.ii.508; cp. MA.ii.619); na lacchati Máro otáram, Máro ti devaputtmáro pi maccumáro pi kilesamáro pi (DA.iii.846); but elsewhere five are mentioned   e.g., ariyamaggakkhane kilesamáro abhisahkháramáro, devaputtamáro ca carimaka cittakkhane khandhamáro maccumáro ti pañcavidhamáro abhibhúto parájito (UdA.216). Very occasionally four Máras are mentioned: catunnam Máránam matthakam madditvá anuttaram sammásambodhim abhisamabuddho (MNid. 129); indakhílopamo catubbidhamáraparavádiganehi akampiyatthena (SNA.i.201); Márasenam sasenam abhibhuyyáti kilesasenáya anantasenáya ca sasenam anavasittham, catubbidham pi máram abhibhavitvá devaputtamárassá pi hi gunamárane saháyabhávúpagamanato kilesá sená ti vuccanti (ItvA.136). The last quotation seems to indicate that the four Máras are the five Máras less Devaputta Mára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few particulars are available about Devaputta Mára: Máro ti Vasavattibhúmiyam aññataro dámarikadevaputto. So hi tam thánam atikkamitukámam janam yam na sakkoti tam máreti, yam na sakkoti tassa pi maranam icchati, tená Máro ti vuccati (SNA.i.44); Máro yeva pana sattasankhátáya pajáya adhipatibhávena idha Pajápatíti adhippeto. So hi kuhim vasatíti? Paranimmittavasavattidevaloke. Tatra hi Vasavattirájá rajjam káreti. Máro ekasmim padese attano parisáya issariyam pavattento rajjapaccante dámarikarájapittto viya vasatí ti vadanti (MA.i.28); so hi Máro opapátiko kámávacarissaro, kadáci brahmapárisajjánampi káye adhimuccitum samattho (Jinálankára Tíká, p.217).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In view of the many studies of Mára by various scholars, already existing, it might be worth while here, too, to attempt a theory of Mára in Buddhism, based chiefly on the above data. The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean &quot;the world under the sway of death&quot; (also called Máradheyya -  </data>
<data>e.g., A.iv.228) and the beings therein. Thence, the kilesas also came to be called Mára in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the kilesas were likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a devaputta of the Vasavatti world, called Mára, who considered himself the head of the Kámávacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Mára, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the kilesas, and the world over which Death and the kilesas hold sway. Thus: Those who can restrain the mind and check its propensities can escape the snares of Mára (Dhp. Yamaka, vs. 7). He who delights in objects cognizant to the eye, etc., has gone under Mára's sway (S.iv.91). He who has attachment is entangled by Mára (S.iii.73). Mára will overthrow him who is unrestrained in his senses, immoderate in his food, idle and weak (Dhp. Yamaka, vs. 8). By attaining the Noble Eightfold Path one can be free from Mára (Dhp. vs. 40). The Samyutta (i. 135) records a conversation between Mára and Vajirá. She has attained arahantship, and tells Mára: &quot;There is no satta here who can come under your control; there is no being but a mere heap of sankháras (suddhasankhárarapuñja).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The later books, especially the Nidánakathá of the Játaka Commentary (J.i.71ff.; cp. MA.i.384) and the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p. 239f), contain a very lively and detailed description of the temptation of the Buddha by Mára, as the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree immediately before his </data>
<data>Enlightenment. These accounts describe how Mára, the devaputta, seeing the Bodhisatta seated, with the firm resolve, of becoming a Buddha, summoned all his forces and advanced against him. These forces extended to a distance of twelve yojanas to the front of the Bodhisatta, twelve to the back, and nine each to the right and to the left. Mára himself, thousand armed, rode on his elephant, Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height. His followers assumed various fearsome shapes and were armed with dreadful weapons. At Mára's approach, all the various Devas, Nágas and others, who were gathered round the Bodhisatta singing his praises and paying him homage, disappeared in headlong flight. The Bodhisatta was left alone, and he called to his assistance the ten párami which he had practiced to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mára's army is described as being tenfold, and each division of the army is described, in very late accounts (especially in Singhalese books), with great wealth of detail. Each division was faced by the Buddha with one páramí and was put to flight. Mára's last weapon was the Cakkávudha (q.v.). But when he hurled it at the Buddha it stood over him like a canopy of flowers. Still undaunted, Mára challenged the Buddha to show that the seat on which he sat was his by right. Mára's followers all shouted their evidence that the seat was Mára's. The Buddha, having no other witness, asked the Earth to bear testimony on his behalf, and the Earth roared in response. Mára and his followers fled in utter rout, and the Devas and others gathered round the Buddha to celebrate his victory. The sun set on the defeat of Mára. This, in brief, is the account of the Buddha's conquest of Mára, greatly elaborated in later chronicler, and illustrated in countless Buddhist shrines and temples with all the wealth of riotous color and fanciful imagery that </data>
<data>gifted artists could command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That this account of the Buddha's struggle with Mára is literally true, none but the most ignorant of the Buddhists believe, even at the present day. The Buddhist point of view has been well expressed by Rhys Davids (Article on Buddha in the Ency. Brit.). We are to understand by the attack of Mára's forces, that all the Buddha's &quot;old temptations came back upon him with renewed force. For years he had looked at all earthly good through the medium of a philosophy which had taught him that it, without exception, carried within itself the seeds of bitterness and was altogether worthless and impermanent; but now, to his wavering faith, the sweet delights of home and love, the charms of wealth and power, began to show themselves in a different light and glow again with attractive colors. He doubted and agonized in his doubt, but as the sun set, the religious side of his nature had won the victory and seems to have come out even purified from the struggle.&quot; There is no need to ask, as does Thomas, with apparently great suspicion (Thomas, op. cit., 230), whether we can assume that the elaborators of the Mára story were recording &quot;a subjective experience under the form of an objective reality,&quot; and did they know or think that this was the real psychological experience which the Buddha went through? The living traditions of the Buddhist countries supply the adequate answer, without the aid of the rationalists. The epic nature of the subject gave ample scope for the elaboration so dear to the hearts of the Páli rhapsodists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similar story among Jains, as recorded in their commentarial works -  e.g., in the Uttarádhyayana Sútra (ZDMG. vol. 49 (1915), 321ff )   bears no close parallelism to the Buddhist account, but only a faint resemblance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the Mára legend had its origin in </data>
<data>the Padhána Sutta (q.v.). There Mára is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjará, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to Mára's army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others. &quot;Seeing this army on all sides,&quot; says the Buddha, &quot;I go forth to meet Mára with his equipage (saváhanam). He shall not make me yield ground. That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.&quot; Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the Padhána Sutta (SN. vs. 446f.; cf. S.i.122) is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama, and this the Commentary (SNA.ii.391) definitely tells us. After Mára had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, &quot;like a crow attacking a rock,&quot; he left Gotama in disgust. &quot;The lute of Mára, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence.&quot; This lute, according to the Commentary (SNA.ii.394), was picked up by Sakka and given to Pañcasikha. Of this part of the sutta, more anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.124f.; given also at Lal. 490 (378); cp. A.v.46; see also DhA.iii.195f ) also contains a sutta (&quot;Dhítaro&quot; </data>
<data>Sutta) in which three daughters of Mára are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment. Their names are Tanhá, Arati and Ragá, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Mára's army, as given in the Padhána Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Mára came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Mára was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans. Thus the books mention various occasions on which Mára appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the Buddha's first vassa, Mára approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by Mára's fetters. But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine (Vin.i.22). On another occasion Mára entered into the body of Vetambarí and made him utter heretical doctrines. (S.i.67; cp. DhA.iv.141, where Mára asks the Buddha about the further shore. In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.326) Mára is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants, of the Brahma world). The Mára Samyutta (S.i.103ff ) contains several instances of Mára's temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhakúta fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his </data>
<data>hearers (E.g., at Ekasalá; cf. Nigrodha and his fellow Paribbájakas, D.iii.58). Once, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks, Mára came in the guise of a bullock and broke their bowls, which were standing in the air to dry; on another occasion he made a great din so that the minds of the listening monks were distracted. Again, when the Buddha went for alms to Pañcasálá, he entered into the brahmin householders and the Buddha had to return with empty bowl. Mára approached the Buddha on his return and tried to persuade him to try once more; this was, says the Commentary, a ruse, that he might inspire insult and injury in addition to neglect. But the Buddha refused, saying that he would live that day on píti, like the Abhassara gods. The incident is related at length in SA.i.140f. and DhA.iii.257f.; the Commentaries (e.g., Sp.i.178f.) state that the difficulty experienced by the Buddha and his monks in obtaining food at Verañja (q.v.) was also due to the machinations of Mára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, as the Buddha was preaching to the monks on Nibbána, Mára came in the form of a peasant and interrupted the sermon to ask if anyone had seen his oxen. His desire was to make the cares of the present life break in on the calm and supramundane atmosphere of the discourse on Nibbána. On another occasion he tempted the Buddha with the fascination of exercising power that he might rescue those suffering from the cruelty of rulers. Once, at the Sákyan village of Sílavatí, he approached the monks who were bent on study, in the shape of a very old and holy brahmin, and asked them not to abandon the things of this life, in order to run after matters involving time. In the same village, he tried to frighten Samiddhi away from his meditations. Samiddhi sought the Buddha's help and went back and won arahantship. (Cp. the story of Nandiya Thera. Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.864) that when Súrambattha, after </data>
<data>listening to a sermon of the Buddha, had returned home, Mára visited him there in the guise of the Buddha and told him that what he (the Buddha) had preached to him earlier was false. Súrambattha, though surprised, could not be shaken in his faith, being a sotápanna). Mára influenced Godhika to commit suicide and tried to frighten Ráhula in the guise of a huge elephant. (DhA.iv.69f ). In the account of Godhika's suicide (S.i.122) there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, Mára went about looking for his (Godhika's) consciousness (patisandhicitta), and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, &quot;going about like a cloud of smoke.&quot; Later, Mára came to the Buddha, like a little child (khuddadárakavanní), (SA.i.145) holding a vilva lyre of golden color, and he questioned the Buddha about Godhika. (This probably refers to some dispute which arose among the monks regarding Godhika's destiny.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books mention many occasions on which Mára assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunís, often in lonely spots -  e.g., Álaviká, Kiságotamí, Somá, Vijayá, Uppalavantná, Cálá, Upacálá, Sisúpacálá, Selá, Vajirá and Khemá. To the same category of temptations belongs a story found in late commentaries (J.i.63): when Gotama was leaving his palace on his journey of Renunciation, Mára, here called Vasavattí, appeared before him and promised him the kingdom and the whole world within seven days if he would but turn back. Mára's temptations were not confined to monks and nuns; he tempted also lay men and women and tried to lure them from the path of goodness - e.g., in the story of Dhaniya and his wife. (SNA.i.44; see also J.i.231f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made, especially in the Mahá Parinibbána Sutta, of several occasions on which Mára approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelá, soon </data>
<data>after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sásana was firmly established. Can it be that here we have the word Mára used in the sense of physical death (Maccumára), and that the occasions referred to were those on which the Buddha felt the desire to die, to pass away utterly, to &quot;lay down the burden&quot;? Perhaps they were moments of physical fatigue, when he lay at death's door, for we know (see Gotama) that the six years he spent in austerities made inroads on his health and that he suffered constantly from muscular cramp, digestive disorders and headache. (It is true that in the Mahásaccaka Sutta (M.i.240ff.), which contains an account of the events leading up to the Enlightenment, there is no mention whatsoever of any temptation by Mara, nor is there any mention of the Bodhi tree. But to argue from this, that such events did not form part of the original story, might be to draw unwarranted inferences from an argumentum e silentio.) At Beluvagáma, shortly before he finally decided to die, we are told (D.ii.99; cp. Dvy. 203) that &quot;there fell upon him a dire sickness, and sharp pains came upon him even unto death.&quot; But the Buddha conquered the disease by a strong effort of his will because he felt it would not be right for him to die without addressing his followers and taking leave of the Order. Compare with this Mára's temptation of the Buddha at Maddakucchi (q.v.), when he laid suffering from severe pain after the wounding of his foot by a splinter. It may have been the physical weariness, above referred to, which at first made the Buddha reluctant to take upon himself the great exertions which the propagation of his Dhamma would involve (e.g., Vin.i.4f). We know of other arahants who actually committed suicide in order to escape being worried by physical ills -  e.g., Godhika, Vakkali, Channa. When their suicide was reported to the Buddha, he declared them free </data>
<data>from all blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can it be, further, that with the accounts of Mára, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual devaputta, named Mára, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmita Vasavatti deva world? Already in the Anguttara Nikáya, Mára is described (aggo ádhipateyyánam iddhiyá yasasá jalam) as the head of those enjoying bliss in the Kámávacara worlds and as a dámarika devaputta (as mentioned earlier). A.ii.17. Even after the Buddha's death Mára was regarded as wishing to obstruct good works. Thus, at the enshrinement of the Buddha's relics in the Mahá Thúpa, Indagutta Thera (by supernatural power) made a parasol of copper to cover the universe, in order that it might ward off the attentions of Mára (Mhv.xxxi.85).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can it be that ancient legends represented him as looking on with disfavour at the activities of the Buddha? Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.533) that Máradevaputta, having dogged the Buddha's footsteps for seven years, and having found no fault in him, came to him and worshipped him. Is it, then, possible that some of the conversations, which the Buddha is reported to have had with Mára -  e.g., in the second part of the Padhána Sutta (see above)   were originally ascribed to a real personage, designated as Máradevaputta, and later confused with the allegorical Mára? This suggestion gains strength from a remark found in the Máratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.333; cp. D.iii.79) uttered by Moggallána, that he too had once been a Mára, Dúsí by name; Kálá was his sister's name, and the Mára of the present age was his nephew. In the sutta, Dúsí is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Mára of Gotama's day. According to the sutta, Máradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men. </data>
<data>This suggestion is, at all events, worthy of further investigation. See also Márakáyiká deva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mára bears many names in Páli Literature, chief of them being Kanha, Adhipati, Antaka, Namuci and Pamattabandhu. (MNid.ii.489; for their explanation see MNidA.328; another name of Mára was Pajápati, MA.i.28). His usual standing epithet is pápimá, but other words are also used, such as anatthakáma, ahitakáma, and ayogakkhemakáma (E.g., M.i.118).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mára is called Namuci because none can escape him   Namucí ti Máro; so hi attano visayá nikkhamitukáme devamanusse na muñcati antaráyam tesam karoti tasma Namucí ti vuccati (SNA.ii.386). In the Mahásamaya Sutta, Namuci is mentioned among the Asuras as being present in the assembly. D.ii.259; elsewhere in the same sutta (p. 261f.) it is said that when all the devas and others had assembled to hear the Buddha preach, Mara came with his &quot;swarthy host&quot; and attempted to blind the assembly with thoughts of lust, etc. But the Buddha, seeing him, warned his followers against him and Mára had to depart unsuccessful. At the end of the sutta, four lines are traditionally ascribed to Mára. They express admiration of the Buddha and his followers. In this sutta Mára is described as mahásena (having a large army).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (DA.ii.689) that Namuci refers to Máradevaputta and accounts for his presence among the Asuras by the fact that he was temperamentally their companion (te pi acchandiká abhabbá, ayam pi tádiso yeva, tasmá dhátuso samsandamáno ágato). Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.133; cp. MNidA. 328) that Mára is so called because he destroys all those who seek to evade him   attano visayam atikkamitum patipanne satte máreti ti Máro; he is called Vasavatti (SA.i.158) because he rules all   Máro náma vasavattí sabesam upari vasam vattati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;</data>

From the time of his son’s death, the brahmin would go to the cemetery and walk round the heap of ashes, moaning piteously. The deva visited him and admonished him, as in the story of Mattakundali. The brahmin followed his advice and gave up his grief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a rich landowner of Sávatthi, a devout follower of the Buddha, who lost his son. The Buddha, knowing of his great grief, visited him in the company of Ananda and preached to him. At the conclusion of the sermon, the landowner became a sotápanna.

He was governor of Dakkhinadesa. He was later found guilty of an offence in the women's apartments of the palace and was treacherously killed by the court officers. Cv.xliv.84,123f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mána.&lt;/b&gt; Eldest son of Kassapa II. (Cv.xlv.6) His full name was Mánavamma. (Regarding these names, Mána and Mánavamma, see Cv. Trs.i.192, n. 3.). He was very young when his father died, and, when the government fell into the hands of Dappula I. and later of Dáthopatissa II., he left Uttaradesa, where he was living in retirement with his wife Sanghá, and went to Jambudípa, there to take service under the Pallava king, Narasíha (for details see Cv.xivii.9ff., 15ff). He won the king's favor and very loyally helped him to defeat the Vallabha king. He then raised an army with the help of Narasíha, landed in Ceylon, and recovered the kingdom from Dáthopatissa. But later his army deserted him on hearing tidings of Narasíha's illness and Mána returned once more to Jambudípa. Some time after he came again to Ceylon with a large army and defeated Hatthadátha, the reigning king, and his general Potthakuttha. In the confusion which followed, Hatthadátha was killed and Potthakuttha was poisoned at Merukandara. Mána thereupon became king and did many acts of merit, including the erection of the Padhánarakkha  and the Sirisanghabodhi viháras, also the Sepanni  and Siri pásádas. Mána was a supporter of the Pamsukúlins. Cv.xlvii.1ff. Mánavamma reigned circa 676 711 A.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mána &lt;/b&gt;(also called Mánavamma). He was the nephew of Kassapa II. and the son of Dappula I. Kassapa handed over the kingdom to him at the time of his death, his own children being very young. When Kassapa died, </data>
<data>the Damilas attacked Ceylon, but Mána, with his father's help, repulsed them and crowned his father king. When Hatthadátha heard of this, he came with a large force and seized the throne under the name of Dáthopatissa II. Mána went to the Eastern Province, while Dappula returned to Rohana. Later, Mána led a rebellion against Dáthopatissa and was killed in battle (Cv.xlv.1ff.; 52, 77ff). His mother was the sister of Kassapa II. and the daughter of King Silámeghavanna. Cv. Trs.i.94, n. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mána.&lt;/b&gt; Called Múlapotthakí. He was an officer of Parakkamabáhu I. and, in one campaign, defeated Lokagalla Vikkama at Mahágáma.

Malliká Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;a href="mallikaa')"&gt;Malliká&lt;/a&gt; visits the Buddha and asks him why some women are beautiful, others plain, some rich, others poor. The Buddha explains that if a woman be ill tempered and irritable, jealous and slow to give alms, such a one becomes poor and of ill favour, wherever she may happen to be born. A woman, however, who never becomes angry or agitated even under great provocation, and is generous, such a one becomes beautiful and rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malliká declares her determination for the future, to be gentle in temper, never revengeful or harbouring a grudge, but always amiable and generous. A.ii.202ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahilámukha Játaka (No. 26)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brahmadatta, king of Benares, owned a state elephant, called Mahilámukha, who was gentle and good. One day thieves sat down outside his stable and started talking of their plans for robbery, and murder. Several days in succession this happened, until at last, by dint of listening to them, Mahilámukha became cruel and began to kill his keepers. The king sent his minister, the Bodhisatta, to investigate the matter. He discovered what had happened, and made good men sit outside the stables who talked of various virtues. The elephant regained his former goodness and gentleness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who was persuaded by a friend to eat at the monastery of Gayásísa, built for Devadatta by Ajátuattu. The monk would steal off there at the hour of the meal and then return to Veluvana. After some time his guilty secret was discovered, and he was admonished by the Buddha. He is identified with Mahilámukha and the king with Ananda. J.i.185 8; see also Giridanta and Manoja Játakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahisa Játaka (No. 278). The Bodhisatta, was born once as a buffalo in Himavá. One day, as he stood under a tree, a monkey fouled him, and taking hold of his horn pulled him about. But the buffalo showed no resentment. This happened several times, and on being asked by the spirit of the tree why he endured it, the buffalo answered that it was by virtue of his goodness. Later the monkey tried his games on another buffalo, who killed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monkey who, in the same way, fouled an elephant of Sávatthi and escaped unhurt owing to the patience of the elephant. On another day a fierce elephant came from the stables and the monkey was trampled to death. J.i.385 7.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahinda (1-24)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahinda Thera. &lt;/b&gt;Son of Asoka and brother of Sanghamittá. He was fourteen at the time of the coronation of his father and was ordained at the age of twenty, his preceptor being Moggaliputtatissa. The ordination was performed by Mahádeva, while Majjhantika recited the kammavácá. Mahinda became an arahant on the day of his ordination (Mhv.v.204ff.; Dpv.v.24 f ; Sp.i.51). He spent three years in study of the Doctrine under his preceptor, and, later, when the latter retired to Ahogangá, he left his one thousand disciples for seven years under the care of Mahinda (Mhv.v.233; Sp.i.52). When the Third Council was held, Mahinda had been for twelve years a monk and was charged with the mission of converting Ceylon. But he delayed for six months, until Devánampiyatissa became king. He then went to Dakkhinágiri and from there to his birthplace, Vedisagiri, staying in Vedisagiri vihára and visiting his mother, the queen Deví. Still one more month he tarried, teaching the Doctrine to Bhanduka, and then, on the full moon day of Jettha, at the request of Sakka, he went, in company with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Itthiya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Uttiya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sambala, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Bhaddasála, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sumanasámanera and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Bhanduka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;to Ceylon, where he converted Devánampiyatissa by preaching to him the Cúlahatthipadopama Sutta. Later, on the same day, he preached the Samacitta Sutta. The next day, at the request of the king, he visited Anurádhapura, travelling through the air and alighting on the site of the (later) Pathamacetiya. After a meal at the palace he preached the Petavatthu, the Vimánavatthu and the Sacca Samyutta, and Anulá and her five hundred </data>
<data>companions became sotápannas. Later, in the elephant stables, he preached the Devadúta Sutta to the assembled people, and, in the evening, the Bálapandita Sutta, in Nandanavana. The night he spent in Mahámeghavana, and on the next day the king gave the park to Mahinda, on behalf of the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda pointed out to the king various spots destined to be connected with the growth of the sásana in Ceylon, offering flowers at the same, and at the site of the (later) Mahá Thúpa, he described the visits of the Four Buddhas of this kappa to Ceylon. On the fourth day he preached the Anamatagga Sutta in Nandanavana and helped the king in defining the boundaries of what later became the Mahávihára. On the fifth day he preached the Khajjaníya Sutta, on the sixth the Gomayapindí sutta, and on the seventh the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pásáda first built for the residence of Mahinda was called Kálapásáda parivena. Other buildings associated with him were the Sunhátaparivena, the Díghacanka parivena, the Phalagga parivena, the Therápassaya parivena, the Marugana-parivena, and the Díghasandasenápati-parivena. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty six days Mahinda stayed in Mahámeghavana, and on the thirteenth day of the bright half of Ásálha, after having preached the Maháppamáda Sutta, he went to Missakapabbata, to spend the vassa. The king had sixty eight rock cells built in the mountain and gave them to the theras on the full moon day. On the same day Mahinda ordained sixty two monks, who attained arahantship, at Tumbarumálaka. After the full moon day of Kattika, at the conclusion of the pavárana ceremony, Mahinda held a consultation with Devánampiyatissa and sent Sumanasámanera to Pátaliputta to bring the relics of the Buddha from Dhammásoka and other relics from Sakka. These relics were brought and placed on the Missakapabbata, which from then onwards was called </data>
<data>Cetiyegiri. The collar bone from among the relics was deposited in the Thúpáráma (q.v.), which was built for the purpose. It was at Mahinda's suggestion that Devánampiyatissa sent an embassy headed by Maháarittha to Asoka, with a request that Sanghamittá should come to Ceylon with a branch of the Bodhi tree. The request was granted, and Sanghamittá arrived in Ceylon with the branch. Devánampiyatissa, during the later part of his reign, acting on the advice of Mahinda, built numerous viháras, each one yojana from the other; among them were Issarasamanaka and Vessagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda is said to have taught the Commentaries to the Tipitaka in, the Singhalese language, after translating them from the Páli (Cv.xxxvii.228ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samantapásádiká (pp. 102ff ) mentions a recital held by Mahinda under the presidency of Maháarittha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda continued to live for the first eight years of the reign of Uttiya, who succeeded Devánampiyatissa. Then, at the age of sixty, he died on the eighth day of the bright half of Assayuja, in Cetiyagiri, where he was spending the rainy season. His body was brought in procession, with every splendor and honour, to the Mahávihára and placed in the Pañhambamálaka, where homage was paid to it for a whole week. It was then burnt on a pyre of fragrant wood on the east of the Theránambandhamálaka, to the left of the site of the Mahá Thúpa. A cetiya was erected on that spot over half the remains, the other half being distributed in thúpas built on Cetiyagiri and elsewhere. The place of cremation was called Isibhúmangana, and there for many centuries were cremated the remains of holy men who lived within a distance of three yojanas.( For details of Mahinda see Mhv.xiii. xx; Dpv.vii.57f., xii., xiii., iv.: xv.; Sp.i.61, 69ff., 79ff., 83ff., 90ff., 103, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, King Sirimeghavanip had a life size image of </data>
<data>Mahinda made of gold; this he took to the Ambatthalacetiya. For eight days a festival was held in its honour; on the ninth day the image was taken from Ambatthala, carried by the king himself at the head of a large and splendid procession, and placed for three days in Sotthiyákara vihára. On the twelfth day it was taken with all splendours to Anurádhapura, to the Mahávihára, where it was left for three months in the courtyard of the Bodhi tree. From there it was removed to the inner city and deposited in a magnificent image house to the south east of the palace. An endowment was set up for the annual performance of ceremonies in honour of the image, and this custom was continued for many centuries. The image was brought from the inner town to the (Mahá)vihára on the pavárana day, and every year an offering was made on the thirteenth day (Cv.xxxvii.66ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhátusena had the image brought to the place where Mahinda's body was cremated and there held a great festival (Cv.xxxviii.58), while Aggabodhi I. set up the image on the banks of the tank called Mahindatata, and ensured that the special task of carrying the image to the dyke of the tank was the task of the Taracchas. Cv.xlii.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; See Indra (=Sakka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

He refused to be crowned, out of sorrow for the death of his friend Níla, and administered the government as ádipáda. He thus came to be </data>
<data>known as Adipáda Mahinda. His brother's son, Aggabodhi, was his viceroy, while his own son was made ruler of Dakkhinadesa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave ten cartloads of food to the Mahápáli and would eat nothing without first giving of it to beggars. He built a nunnery for the bhikkhunís (called Mahindaupassaya) and gave to it the village of Nagaragalla. He also built the Mahindatata vihára. Cv.xiviii.26ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Aggabodhi VII. He was made viceroy, but died young. Cv.xlviii.69, 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Silámegha (Aggabodhi VI.) (Cv.xlviii.42, 76). Aggabodhi made him senápati and gave over the government to him. But when Aggabodhi VI. died and Aggabodhi VII. came to the throne, Mahinda went to Mahátittha. Later, on the death of Aggabodhi VII., Mahinda quelled all disturbances and put the queen in chains because she conspired to kill him. His cousin Dappula rose against him, but was defeated after much fighting. Mahinda then married the queen of Aggabodhi VI. and became king as Mahinda II., when a son was born to him. Dappula again rose in revolt, but Mahinda made a treaty with him and gave him part of Rohana with the Gálhagangá as boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Mahinda's benefactions was the erection of the Dámavihára-parivena and the Sanníratittha vihára in Pulatthipura, also the costly Ratanapásáda, containing a golden image of the Buddha. To the Silámegha nunnery Mahinda gave a silver Bodhisatta statue. He had the Abhidhamma recited by the monks of Hemasáli Vihára, and built many shrines and helped those who were poor or in trouble. To the lame he gave bulls and to the Damilas horses. He strengthened the weir of the Kálavápi. He reigned for twenty years (772 92 A.C.) and was succeeded by his son Udaya I. (Cv.xlviii.83ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of the Adipáda Dáthásíva of Rohana. He quarreled with his father, took service under Udaya I. and married his daughter Devá. He was later sent to Rohana, where he drove out his father. His two sons revolted against him, and, with Udaya's help, led an army against him. Mahinda defeated them, but was killed in a fight with another kinsman. Cv.xlix.10ff.; 66ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Udaya I.; he was, however, known by the name of Dhammikasilámegha and was a very pious man. He gave the income from the Getthumba Canal to be used in repairs of the Ratanapásáda. He became king as Mahinda III. and reigned for four years (797 801 A.C.). Cv.xlix.38ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Mahinda. &lt;/b&gt;Son of Mahinda III. When Aggabodhi IX. came to the throne, contrary to the laws of succession, Mahinda fled to India (Cv.xlix.84f). He was afterwards slain by Sena I. (Cv.l.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Younger brother of Sena I. and his viceroy. He quelled the rising of Udaya against the king, his brother. When the Pandu king invaded Ceylon, Mahinda led an army against him, and, on the defeat of his forces, he cut his own throat. Cv.l. 6, 10, 21ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Eldest son of Kittaggabodhi, ruler of Rohana. He was killed by Kittaggabodhi's sister. Cv.l.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of the Adipáda Kassapa and brother of Sena II. He married Tissá and Kitti. He became viceroy under Sena II. and ruled in Dakkhinadesa. Later he was discovered guilty of an intrigue in the king's harem, and fled, unrecognized, with his family, to Malaya. Afterwards, however, he regained his honors and continued as viceroy, his daughter Sanghá being married to Kassapa, son of Sena II. Mahinda built a temple under the Bodhi </data>
<data>tree, and, in the course of its construction, a workman discovered that one of the beams would harm a branch of the tree. Mahinda, on being informed of this, came and made a saccakiriyá, as a result of which the branch of the tree straightened itself during the night, leaving the building free. Mahinda also built the Mahindasena parivena, and died in the twenty third year of Sena's reign (Cv.l.59; li.7, 13, 15ff., 53ff). Adipáda Kittaggabodhi was his Son. Ibid., 94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Kassapa V., and brother of Sena II. and Sanghá. When the Adipáda Kittaggabodhi raised a rebellion in Rohana against Udaya II., the latter sent Mahinda to quell it with the help of the general Vajiragga. The expedition was completely successful and Kittaggabodhi taken prisoner. Mahinda stayed in Mahágáma and ruled over Rohana justly and well. Among his works was the construction of a dam across the Mahánadí (Cv.li.99ff). When Kassapa IV. became king, Mahinda revolted against him, but the king, through the influence of Mahinda's father, persuaded him to desist. Later, Mahinda returned to Anurádhapura at the request of the monks, and, after having married the king's daughter, went back to Rohana, where, evidently, he died. Cv.lii.4ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Viceroy of Sena IV. and probably his brother. He afterwards became king as Mahinda IV. (956 72 A.C.). He married a Kálinga princess. During his reign, the Vallabha king invaded Ceylon, but was defeated by the general Sena and entered into a treaty with Mahinda. Mahinda showed great favour to the Pamsukulikas and the Lábhavásins and decreed that the incomes derived from viháras should not be taxed. His good acts were many. He had a Commentary to the Abhidhamma written by the Thera Dhammamitta in the Sitthagáma-parivena and the Abhidhamma recited by the Thera Dáthánága.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;He made great offerings at the Mahá Thúpa and started to build the Candanapásáda, where he had preserved the Hair Relic of the Buddha. He restored the temple of the four cetiyas in Padalañchana as well as the Temple of the Tooth, the Dhammasanganigeha and the Mahápáli. He built the Mahámallaka for the Theraváda nuns and completed the Manipásáda. Mahinda's wife was Kittí (q.n), who, herself, engaged in various works. Their son was Sena (Sena V.). Cv.liv.1ff.; Cv. Trs.i.178, n. 2; 179, n. 2; 183, n. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Younger brother of Sena V. He succeeded Sena as Mahinda V. and ruled for ten years at Anurádhapura under great difficulties. He was weak and powerless, and the Kerala soldiers in his employ mutinied for better salaries. Mahinda escaped to Rohana by means of an underground passage, and lived at Sídupabbatagáma with his brother's wife as queen, later marrying his brother's daughter. Their son was Kassapa, and afterwards they lived in Kappagallaka. In the thirty sixth year of Mahinda's reign, the Colas, taking advantage of the discontent in Ceylon, invaded the country, capturing the king, the queen, and all the royal regalia. They ruled for many years with Pulatthinagara as base, and Mahinda died in Cola after a captivity lasting for twelve years (Cv.iv.1ff). Lokitá and Devalá were his maternal cousins. Cv.lvii.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. Mahinda&lt;/b&gt;. Son of Moggallána and Lokitá and brother of Kiti (afterwards Vijayabáhu I.). Cv.lvii.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;18. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Vikkamabáhu II. and brother of Gajabahu. He fought against Deva, general of Parakkamabáhu I,, at Hedillakhandagáma, but was defeated, and fled to Billagáma. From there he went to Vallitittha, and was again defeated. Later he joined Mánábharana, and was sent by him to Moravápi, thence to Anurádhapura, where he defeated Mahálekha </data>
<data>Rakkha and Bhandárapotthakí, who marched against him. From Anurádhapura, Mahinda proceeded to Kálavápi where, for three months, he fought against Bhandárapotthakí Bhúta, and was finally defeated by him. This is the last we hear of him.

He was a Nagaragiri, and was sent by Parakkamabáhu to Mallaválána, where he conducted a victorious campaign against Uttararattha. Later he took Anurádhapura, and was one of those responsible for the capture of Gajabáhu at Pulatthipura. Cv.lxix. 13; lxx. 89, 146ff.; 158, 199ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;21.

One day, the Nága king Manikantha, while walking along the river in the guise of a man, came to the hut of the younger ascetic and became his friend. Thereafter he called daily and their friendship grew apace. Manikantha finally became so fond of the ascetic that he put off his disguise, and encircling the other in his folds, lay thus for a short while each day, until his affection was satisfied. But the ascetic was afraid of his Nága shape and grew thin and pale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta noticing this, suggested that the next time Manikantha came, his brother should ask for the jewel which he wore round his throat. On the morrow, when the ascetic made this request, Manikantha hurried away. Several times this happened, and then he came no more. The ascetic was much grieved by his absence, but was comforted by the Bodhisiatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha related this story at the Aggálava-cetiya near Alavi. The monks of Alavi became so importunate with their requests for building materials from the householders that at the mere sight of a monk the householders would hurry indoors. Mahá Kassapa discovered this and reported it to the Buddha, who admonished the monks against begging for things from other people. J.ii.282 6; also Vin.iii.146f., where the details of the story of the past are slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same occasion were preached the Brahmadatta Játaka and the Atthisena Játaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mangala&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;1. Mangala&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third of the twenty four Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas ago in the Uttaramadhura Park, in the city of Uttara, his father being a khattiya named Uttara and his mother Uttará. It is said that from the day of her conception, an aura shed its rays night and day from her body, to a distance of eighty hands -  hence his name. He surpassed other Buddhas in glory of body. In his last birth as a human being (corresponding to that of Vessantara in the case of Gotama) he lived with his family as an ascetic. A man eating yakkha, named Kharadáthika, took from him his two children and ate them in his presence, &quot;crunching them as though they were yams,&quot; while the blood dripped from his mouth. (It is probably this incident, which is referred to at J.iv.13). The Bodhisatta stood firm in his resolve and repented not of his gift to the yakkha, but registered a desire that in future births his body should emit light as bright as the blood which flowed down the yakkha's face. In a previous birth, Mangala paid honour to the cetiya of a Buddha by wrapping his body in cloth drenched with oil, setting fire to it and walking round the cetiya throughout the night, carrying on his head a golden bowl filled with scented oil and lighted with one thousand wicks. Not a hair on his body suffered damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nine thousand years Mangala lived in the household in three palaces, Yasavá, Sucimá and Sirimá, with his wife Yasavatí, by whom he had one son, Sívala. He left the world on a horse and practised austerities for eight months. Just before his Enlightenment he ate a meal of milk rice given by a maiden, Uttará, daughter of Uttarasetthi in Uttaragáma; an Ájívaka, named </data>
<data>Uttara, gave him grass for his seat. His Bodhi was a Nága tree. After his Enlightenment he lived for ninety thousand years, and for all that time the aura from his body spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, shutting out sun, moon and stars. People knew the times and the seasons by the cries of the birds and the blooming of the flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangala's first sermon was preached in the Sirivaruttama Grove, near Sirivaddha. His chief disciples among men were Sudeva and Dhammasena, and his chief nuns Sívalá and Asoká. Pálita was his constant attendant (BuA.124 calls him Uttara). Nanda and Visákha were his chief patrons among lay men and Anulá and Sutaná among lay women. In Mangala's time the Bodhisatta was the brahmin Suruci (q.v.). Mangala's body was eighty cubits high; he held three assemblies: the first at the preaching of the Dhammacakka, the second at Cittanagara, when he preached to Sunanda, king of Surabhinagara, and his son Anurája, and the third at Mekhala to Sudeva and Dhammasena who later became his chief disciples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died in the park of Vessara, and a cetiya, thirty leagues high, was erected over his ashes (Bu.iv.1ff.; BuA.115ff.; J.i.30 ff.; the particulars found in Mtu.i.248 50, are slightly different). It is said (Bu.iv.29) that all Mangala Buddha's personal disciples attained arahantship before their death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mangala. &lt;/b&gt;The Bodhisatta born as an ascetic in the time of Dhammadassí Buddha. J.i.40; but Bu.xvi.9 says he was then born as Sakka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mangala.&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta born as an ascetic in the time of Siddhattha Buddha (Bu.xvii.8; M.T.62). He was a very rich brahmin of Surasena, and later gave away all his wealth and became an ascetic. On one occasion, by his iddhi power, he obtained fruit which grew on the jambu tree </data>
<data>(which gave its name to Jambudípa) and offered it at the Surasena vihára to Siddhattha Buddha and ninety crores of monks. BuA.187.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

In reply to Ananda's question, he tells him the story of &lt;a href="makhadeva')"&gt;Makhádeva&lt;/a&gt;, of how he renounced the world when gray hairs appeared on his head and became a recluse, enjoining on his eldest son to do likewise when the time came. Makhádeva developed the four &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/b_f/brahma_vihaara')"&gt;Brahmavihárá&lt;/a&gt; and was reborn in the Brahma world.

A lion used to range near the cave in which his shadow was reflected. This so terrified the boars that one day, they fetched mud from a neighbouring pool with which they rubbed the crystal; but because of the boars' bristles, the more they rubbed, the brighter grew the crystal. In despair they consulted the Bodhisatta, who told them that a crystal could not be sullied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to an unsuccessful attempt by the heretics to accuse the Buddha of having seduced Sundarí (q.v.) and then brought about her death.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mátali&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to the chariot driver (sahgáhaka) of Sakka. The Mátali of the present age had a son, Sikhandhi, with whom Bhaddá Suriyavaccasá, daughter of Timbarú, was in love; but later she transferred her affections to Pañcasikha (D.ii.268). Mátali is Sakka's constant companion and accompanies him everywhere, more as a confidant than as a servant. See, e.g., the conversation reported at S.i.221, 224, 234ff.; and Vv.iv. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, he was by Sakka's side in the war against the Asuras and drove his chariot when he fled with his bride Sujátá. The chariot is called Vejayanta ratha and is drawn by one thousand Sindh horses (DhA.i.279f.; J.i.202f). Mátali often accompanied Sakka on his journeys to the world of men, changing his form   e.g., to that of a fish in the Culladhanuggaha Játaka, a brahmin in the Bilárakosiya Játaka and in the Suddhábhojana Játaka, and a big black dog in the Mahákanha Játaka. On several occasions he was sent by Sakka to fetch human beings to Távatimsa   e.g., Guttila, Nimi, Makhádeva and Sádhína   and he proved an excellent guide, pointing out to the visitors the places of interest passed on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha descended from Távatimsa, after preaching there the Abhidhamma, he was accompanied, on the left, by Mátali, offering celestial scents, garlands and flowers (DhA.iii.226). Both in the Bilárakosiya and the Sudhábhojana Játakas (q.v.) Mátali is spoken of as the son of Suriya. Ananda is said to have been Mátali during several lives (J.i.206; iv.180; v. 412; vi.129); so also Mahá Kassapa (J.iv.69). In the Mahásamaya Sutta (D.ii.258), Mátali is described as a Gandhabba chief, while in the Atánátiya Sutta (D.iii.204) he is mentioned among the chief Yakkhas to be invoked by followers of the Buddha in time of need.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

The cetiya was built by Dutthagámaní on the spot where the king's spear, containing the Buddha's relic given to him by the monks (Mhv.xxv.1), was planted, when Dutthagámaní went to the Tissavápí for his ceremonial bathing after his consecration. When the king's men attempted to remove the spear they found it impossible, and the king, after consultation with the monks, decided to build a cetiya enclosing the spot with a vihára attached. The work was completed in three years and a great ceremony of dedication was held, the building and the ceremony costing nineteen crores. The vihára was called Maricavatti because it was intended by the king as expiation for having once eaten a pepper pod (maricavatti) without sharing it with the monks, thus violating the vow of his childhood. For the building of the vihára, see Mhv.xxvi.1ff.; the vow is mentioned at Mhv.xxii.80; the Dpv. makes no mention of Maricavatti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vohárika Tissa renovated the vihára (Mhv.xxxvi.33, 36), while Gothábhaya built an uposatha hall (Mhv.xxxvi.107) and Vasabha provided a mantling for the thúpa (Mhv.xxxv.121).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa II. built a pásáda in the vihára and gave it to the Thera who, at one time, lived in Nágasálá (Cv.xliv.149). Kassapa IV. entrusted the care of the Bodhi tree at Maricavatti to the bhikkhunís at the Tissáráma, which he built for them (Cv.lii.24), while Kassapa V. restored the whole vihára, gave it to the Theravádins and granted five hundred maintenance villages (Cv.lii.45). Devá, mother of Sakkasenápati, provided a diadem jewel for the Buddha image in the vihára, also a halo, an umbrella and a garment (Cv.lii.65). Dappula III. gave a maintenance village to the vihára (Cv.liii.2), </data>
<data>while Mahinda IV. started to build in it a pásáda called Candana, which does not seem to have been completed (Cv.liv.40). Parakkamabáhu I. found the thúpa destroyed by the Damilas and rebuilt it to the height of eighty cubits (Cv.lxxviii.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

After the bath, the goat remembered its past lives and knew that after its death that day it would be free from misery. So it laughed for joy. But it saw also that the brahmin, through slaying it, would suffer great misery, and this thought made it weep. On being questioned as to the reason for its laughing and its weeping, it said the answer would be given before the brahmin. When the brahmin heard the goat's story, he resolved not to kill him; but that same day, while the goat was browsing near a rock, the rock was struck by lightning and a large splinter cut off the goat's head. The Bodhisatta, who was a tree sprite, saw all this and preached the Law to the assembled multitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a question by the monks as to whether there was any good at all in offering sacrifices as Feasts for the Dead, which the people of Sávatthi were in the habit of doing.

See the Mátanga Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mátanga.&lt;/b&gt; A Pacceka Buddha (M.iii.70; ApA.i.107). He was the last of the Pacceka Buddhas and lived near Rájagaha. At the last birth of the Bodhisatta the devas, on their way to do him honour, saw Mátanga and told him, &quot;Sir, the Buddha has appeared in the world.&quot; Mátanga heard this as he was issuing from a trance, and, going to Mount Mahápapáta where&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;Pacceka Buddhas die, he passed away. ApA.i.170; SNA.i.128f; Mtu.i.357.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mátanga.&lt;/b&gt; A hermit. One day he arrived in Benares and went to a potter's hall for the night. He found the place already occupied by another hermit named Játimá, and was told by the potter that he could only stay there with Játimá's permission. Játimá agreed to his staying, but, on finding that Mátanga was a candála, he wished him to occupy a place apart. During the night Mátanga wished to go out, and, not knowing where Játimá was lying, trod on his chest. When Mátanga returned he took the other way with the idea of passing near Játimá's feet, but meanwhile Játimá had changed his position, and Mátanga again trod on his chest. Játimá thereupon cursed him, saying that his head would split in seven pieces at sunrise. Mátanga thereupon stopped the sun from rising (SA.ii.176f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is as in the Mátanga Játaka. It may be a variety of the same legend. cp. also Nárada and Devala. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mátanga&lt;/b&gt;. Father of Mátangaputta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, one of them, a bald, grey-haired man, was planing some wood when a mosquito settled on his head and stung him. He asked his son who was sitting by to drive it away. The boy raised an axe, and meaning to drive away the mosquito, cleft his father's head in two, killing him. The Bodhisatta, a trader, saw this incident. &quot; Better an enemy with sense than such a friend,&quot; said he.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to some inhabitants of a hamlet in Magadha who were worried by mosquitoes when working in the jungle. One day they armed themselves with arrows, and while trying to shoot the mosquitoes, shot each other. The Buddha saw them outside the village greatly disabled because of their folly. J.i.246 48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mánava Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a rich brahmin family of Sávatthi. When on his way to the park one day, at the age of seven, he saw, for the first time, persons afflicted with old age, disease, and death. These filled him with horror, and he went to the monastery, heard the Buddha preach, and, with his parents' consent, entered the Order. He was called &quot;Mánava&quot; because he left the world so young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a physiognomist, and, having seen the child, declared that he would certainly become a Buddha, and worshipped him. In subsequent lives he became king many times under the names of Sammukháthavika, Pathavídundubhi, Obhása, Sadinacchedana, Agginibbápaka, Vátamma, Gatipacchedana, Ratanapajjala, Padakkamana, Vilokana and Girisára (ThagA.vs.73; ThagA.i.162ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Sammukháthavika Thera of the Apadána.

Madhura Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;Avantiputta, king of Madhurá, visits Mahá Kaccána, who is staying at the Gundávana in Madhurá, some time after the Buddha's death, and questions him regarding the brahmin claims to superiority over other castes. Kaccána points out that wealth confers power on all, not only on brahmins. A brahmin experiences the result of his actions both good and bad, in this world and in the next, just as do members of other castes. A brahmin ascetic receives no more homage than an ascetic of other castes. Avantiputta accepts the Buddha's Faith. M.ii.83 90; cp. Ambattha Sutta; for a discussion see Dial.i.105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

But a certain heretic yakkhiní stood before him naked, stretching out her arms, her tongue out. The Buddha thereupon turned back and went to the vihára, where the people entertained him and the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mandhátá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A primeval king, descended from Mahásammata, Roja, Vararoja, Kalyána, Varakalyána and Uposatha, the last named being his father. He was thus an ancestor of the Sákiyans. J.ii.311; iii.454; Mtu.ii.2; Dpv.iii.5; but see SNA.i.352, where the genealogy is slightly different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had the seven Jewels of a Cakka-vatti and his four Supernatural Powers. When he clenched his left hand and touched it with his right, a shower of the seven kinds of jewels fell knee deep from the sky. For eighty four thousand years he was a prince, for eighty four thousand a viceroy, and for eighty four thousand more a king. His life span was an asankheyya. But he grew discontented, and, at the suggestion of his ministers, visited the deva world. First he went to the Cátummahárájika world, where he ruled; but still unsatisfied, he went to Távatimsa. There Sakka welcomed him and gave him half his kingdom. Mandhátá ruled there during the lifetime of thirty six Sakkas, each Sakka's life lasting for thirty six million years and sixty times one hundred thousand. As time went on, Mandhátá's craving increased; he wished to kill Sakka and gain the whole kingdom. Because of his greed his power waned, and he fell from heaven into his park. The gardener announced his arrival to the royal family, and they provided a resting place for him and there he lay dying. When asked for a message for his people, he wished them to know how even he, in spite of his great pomp and power, had to die (J.ii.311ff.; DA.ii.481f.; MA.i.182f.; cp. Dvy.210ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandhátá is identified with the Bodhisatta (J.ii.314). His son was Varamandhátá, whose son was Cara and grandson Upacara (or Apacara) (J.iii.454; Dpv.iii.6). Mandhátá ruled at Rájagaha (SNA.ii.413; DA.i.132), and is named as one of the four persons who attained, while yet in their earthly </data>
<data>bodies, to the glory of the gods. Mil. 115, 291; MA.ii.737f.; the others being Guttila, Sádhína and Nimi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is considered as chief of those given up to the pleasures of the senses and as an example of one whose desires could never be satisfied. A.ii.17; AA.ii.474; e.g., VibhA.506. Thig.486.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mandhátá went to the deva world he was accompanied by inhabitants of all the four continents. After his return to earth, however, the Cakkaratana, stuck fast in the ground, and the others could not return to their homes. They thereupon begged for the intervention of the minister (Parináyaka), who was carrying on the government with Mandhátá's shoes on the throne. He gave them lands in Jambudípa. There those who came from Pubba Videha called their land Videharattha; those from Apara goyána called it Aparantajanapada, and those from Uttarakuru dwelt in what afterwards came to be known as Kururattha.

His father was king of Pandu and his mother, Mittá, was Vijayabáhu's sister. He had two brothers, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha. He married Ratanávalí, daughter of Vijayabáhu (Cv.lix.42ff). When Vijayabáhu died, Jayabáhu I. became king and Mánábharana was made viceroy. When the rightful heir, Vikkamabáhu, rose in revolt, Mánábharana seized from him Rohana and Dakkhinadesa and lived in Punkhagáma, under the name of Vírabáhu (Cv.lxi.21ff). He seems to have lived in constant conflict with Vikkamabáhu. Later, when he had already two daughters, Mittá and Pabhávatí, he gave over the government to his ministers and retired from the world. But seven or eight months later he had a dream in the temple of Indra and hurried back to Punkhagáma because the dream presaged the birth of a mighty son. This son was Parakkamabáhu I. Cv.lxii.3ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mánábharana. &lt;/b&gt;Son of Sirivallabha and Sugalá. Lílávatí was his sister (Cv.lxii.2). He married Mittá, daughter of Mánábharana I., and also her sister, Pabhávatí, and by the latter he had a son, Kittisirimegha (Cv.lxiv. 19, 23, 24). Mánábharana reigned in Rohana as an independent king (Cv.lxvii.95). When the throne was captured by Gajabáhu, Mánábharana tried several times to wrest it from him, but, failing in these attempts, made an alliance with Gajabáhu through the intervention of the monks; later, however, finding Parakkamabáhu growing in power, he went over to him (Cv.lxx.179ff). When Gajabáhu was captured and detained at Pulatthinagara, the soldiers started to pillage the city, despite the orders of Parakkamabáhu. The people were enraged and invited Mánábharana to come. On his arrival at Pulatthipura, he captured Gajabáhu and threw him into a dungeon, seized all the </data>
<data>treasures, including the Tooth Relic and Alms bowl, and took counsel with his mother to kill Gajabáhu. On hearing of this, Parakkamabáhu sent his forces against Mánábharana and defeated the latter's followers at various places. Mánábharana then fled to Rohana, taking with him some of the treasures (Cv.lxx.255ff). From there he again tried to ally himself with Gajabáhu; but the latter did not so desire, though his ministers were in favor of it. Relying on their support, Mánábharana advanced from Rohana. He was, however, severely defeated at Púnagáma and other places and Parakkamabáhu's forces assailed him from all sides. The campaign brought varying success to the opposing armies, and Mánábharana proved a skilful warrior. He was helped by various chieftains and fought bitterly and valiantly to the end (for details see Cv.lxxii.148 309), but, as he lay dying, he summoned his children and ministers and counseled them to join Parakkamabáhu. Even after his death his queen Sugalá encouraged intrigues against Parakkamabáhu . Cv.lxxiv.29ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

Maccharikosiya.&lt;/b&gt; A setthi, worth eighty crores, of Sakkhara near Rájagaha. His real name was Kosiya, but as he was too miserly to give away even a drop of oil, he came to be called Maccharikosiya. One day, when returning from the palace, he saw a half starved yokel eating a round cake filled with sour gruel. The sight made him hungry, but fearing to spend his money, he told no one, but lay on his bed in great distress, till his wife found him. Having discovered the reason for his misery, she said she would bake cakes sufficient for everyone in Sakkhara. &quot;But that would be such extravagance,&quot; said Kosiya, and persuaded his wife to bake just one cake, using only broken grains of rice. Fearful lest someone should ask for a piece of his cake, he retired with her to the seventh storey of his house and there made her start the cooking after bolting all the doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha saw him with his divine eye and sent Moggallána to him; Moggallána stood poised in mid air just outside Kosiya's window and indicated his wish to have something to eat, but Kosiya blustered and threatened, and, after refusing to give him anything, bade his wife cook another little cake for him. But each cake she baked grew bigger than the previous one, and when she tried to take a single cake from the basket, they all stuck together. In despair, Kosiya presented cakes and basket to the Elder. Moggallána then preached on the importance of generosity, and transported Kosiya, his wife and the cakes to Jetavana. There the cakes were offered to the Buddha and five hundred monks, and even after they had all eaten, there was no end to the cakes. The spot where the remaining ones were thrown away at the gates of Jetavana was known as Kapallapúvapabbhára. The Buddha preached to Kosiya and his wife and </data>
<data>they became sotápannas. Kosiya then spent all his wealth in the service of the Buddha and his religion.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;1. Macha Játaka (No. 34)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fishermen once cast their net into a river, and a great fish, swimming along, toying amorously with his wife, was caught in the net, while his wife escaped. The fishermen hauled him up and left him on the sand while they proceeded to light a fire and whittle a spit whereon to roast him. The fish lamented, saying how unhappy his wife would be, thinking he had gone off with another. The Bodhisatta, who was the king's priest, coming along to the river to bathe, heard the lament of the fish and obtained his freedom from the fishermen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a passion tossed monk who longed for the wife of his lay days. The two fish were the monk and his seducer. J.i.210-12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Maccha Játaka (No. 75)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was born as a fish in a pond; there was a great drought, the crops withered, and water gave out in tanks and ponds and there was great distress. Seeing this, the Bodhisatta approached Pajjuna, god of rain, and made an Act of Truth, begging for rain. The request succeeded, and heavy rain fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a great drought in Kosala. Even the pond by the gate of Jetavana was dry, and the Buddha, touched by the universal suffering, resolved to obtain rain. On his way back from the alms round, he sent Ananda to fetch the robe in which he bathed. As he was putting this on, Sakka's throne was heated, and he ordered Pajjuna to send rain. The god filled himself with clouds, and then bending his face and mouth, deluged all Kosala with torrents of rain. The Pajjuna of the earlier story is identified with Ananda. J.i.329 32; cp. Cyp.iii.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Maccha Játaka &lt;/b&gt;(No. 216)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story very much   resembles Maccha Játaka (1). J.ii.178f.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

The jeweller took the stone without wiping his hands and put it in a box. While he went to wash his hands, his pet heron, thinking it was a piece of meat, swallowed it. Tissa was present and saw this happen. The jeweller, finding his jewel had disappeared, suspected Tissa and questioned him. The Elder denied having taken the stone, but said nothing about the heron in case it should be killed. The jeweller became very angry, and, convinced that Tissa was the thief, proceeded to torture him, in spite of the protests of his wife. As the blood flowed from the Elder's body, the heron came to drink it, but the jeweller kicked him and he fell down dead. Then Tissa told the jeweller what had happened. The heron's crop was cut open and the jewel recovered. The jeweller was full of remorse and begged Tissa's pardon, which was readily granted, but, soon after, Tissa passed away into Nibbána. The heron was reborn in the womb of the jeweller's wife. She became a deva after death, but the jeweller was reborn in hell. DhA.iii.34ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He one day visited Rájagaha, and the king invited him to stay in the Royal Park. While he was there, a brahmin who believed in omens as shown by clothes (Dussalakkhana bráhmana) found a garment in his chest which had been gnawed by mice, and, fearing disaster, wished to have it thrown out into the charnel ground. Unwilling to entrust the job to anyone else, he gave the clothes to his son to throw away. The Bodhisatta saw the garment and picked it up in spite of the grave warnings of the old brahmin, saying that no wise man should believe in omens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a superstitious brahmin of Rájagaha who had his clothes thrown away in the manner related above. The Buddha was waiting in the charnel field and picked up the garments. When the brahmin protested, he related to him the story and preached to him on the folly of paying heed to superstitions. At the end of the sermon, father and son became sotápannas. The characters in both stories are the same. J.i.371ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The headman Manicúlaka, who was present, denied this, but, being unable to convince his audience, he sought the Buddha, who assured him that these monks were allowed neither to seek nor to accept gold and silver.

Elder brother of Mána (Mána 2) and son of Kassapa II. Once, as he made an incantation, the god Kumára appeared before him, riding his peacock; the bird, finding nothing to drink, flew at Mánavamma's face. He, thereupon, offered the peacock his eye, of which the bird drank. Kumára promised him the fulfilment of his wish, but he did not aspire to royal power, and retired in favour of his younger brother Mána. Cv.lvii.5ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Anuruddha tested their claims and found them to be true.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of them sang, some danced, some clapped, some played on various musical instruments, but finding that their entertainment was lost on Anuruddha, they left him. Anuruddha told the Buddha of their visit, and the Buddha explained to him the eight qualities, the possession of which enabled women to be born among the Manápakáyiká.

Wise monkeys avoid the traps, but the foolish ones handle the pitch and their paws stick in it, one after another, and finally their muzzles, in their struggles to escape.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mallá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a people and their country.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is included in the sixteen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada')"&gt;Mahájanapadas&lt;/a&gt; of the Buddha's time. The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava')"&gt;Pává&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa')"&gt;Kusinárá&lt;/a&gt;. The Mallas of Pává were called Páveyyaka Mallá, those of Kusinára, Kosináraká. That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha's death at Kusinára, the Mallas of Pává sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha's relics (D.ii.165). Each had their Mote Hall.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sangíti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pává and stayed in the Ambavana of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda')"&gt;Cunda&lt;/a&gt; the smith. A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pává, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night. It was also at Pává that the Buddha took his last meal, of Súkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda (D.ii.126f). From there he went to Kusinárá, and there, as he lay dying, he sent &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; to the Mallas of Kusinára, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death. The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sála grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects. Ananda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family. After the Buddha's death, they met together once more </data>
<data>in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakkavatti&lt;/a&gt;. They cremated the Buddha's body at the &lt;a href="makutabandhana')"&gt;Makutabandhana&lt;/a&gt; cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Dona (D.ii.166). The Mallas, both of Pává and Kusinára, erected thúpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour (D.ii.167).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Malla capital of Kujsinárá was, in the Buddha's day, a place of small importance. Ananda contemptuously refers to it as a &quot;little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township,&quot; quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha's Parinibbána. But the Buddha informs Ananda that it was once Kusávatí (q.v.), the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahásudassana. This shows that the Mallas had, at first, a monarchical constitution, but in the sixth century B.C. they were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic (sangha, gana) (M.i.231). The chief Mallas administered the state in turn. Those who were free from such duties engaged in trade, sometimes undertaking long caravan journeys (DA.ii.569).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Buddha and Nigantha Nátaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas. Pává was the scene of Nátaputta's death, just as Kusinárá was of the Buddha’s (see Pává). Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name -  e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khandasumana, Bhadragaka, Rásiya, Roja and Síha (q.v.). The Mallas seem to have lived at peace with their neighbours, though there was apparently some trouble between them and the Licchavis, as shown by the story of Bandhula Malla </data>
<data>(q.v.). Both the Mallas and the Licchavis were khattiyas, belonging to the Vasittha gotta, because in the books both tribes are repeatedly referred to as Vásetthá (q.v.). Manu says that both Licchavis and Mallas had ksatriya parents, but their fathers were Vrátyas -  i.e., had not gone through the ceremony of Vedic initiation at the proper time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is reason to believe that the Malla republic fell into the hands of Ajátasattu, as did that of the Licchavis (Bhandarkar, Carmichael Lectures, 1918, p.79).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mallas are generally identified with the Malloi mentioned in the Greek accounts of Alexander's invasion of India. The Malloi were a warlike tribe who, for some time, successfully resisted Alexander's attack. Their territory must have been situated in or near the Panjab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other places in the Malla country, besides Pává and Kusinárá, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed -  e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiyá and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahávana, a wide tract of forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bandhula went from Kusinára to Takkasilá for purposes of study. v.l. Málá (E.g., UdA.377) and Malatá (E.g., AA.ii.814), evidently both wrong readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mallá.&lt;/b&gt; A bhikkhuní who came to Ceylon from   Jambudípa; she was an eminent teacher of the Vinaya at Anurádhapura.   Dpv.xviii.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There lived the Bodhisatta, in a hermitage on the bend of the river Kannapanná, where it left Lake Sankhapála (J.v.162). Keka is mentioned as the capital of Mahimsaka, where a king named Ajjuna once ruled (J.v.145) also a city, called Sakula, capital of King Sakula. Near Sakula was a lake, called Mánusiya (J.v.337). In the Bhímasena Játaka (J.i.356) the Bodhisatta is mentioned as living for some time in Mahimsaka in his birth as Cúladhanuggaha pandita. Mahimsaka is mentioned (E.g., Vibhá.4) as an example of a country where cold weather frequently occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is generally identified with Malayagiri, the Malabar Ghats.

Out of compassion for Ugga, the Buddha accepted these gifts and blessed him. Later, Ugga died and was reborn in a mind born world (manomayakáya).

On their way back, they had a meal out of a leaf bottle, and, when they had finished, the Bodhisatta threw the remains into the river for the fish, giving the merit to the river spirit. The power of the river spirit increased and she discovered the cause. The younger brother was of a dishonest disposition, and when the elder was asleep, he packed a parcel of gravel to resemble the money they were carrying and put them both away. While they were in mid river he stumbled against the side of the boat and dropped overboard what he thought to be the parcel of gravel, but what was really the money. He told the Bodhisatta about it who said, &quot;Never mind, what's gone has gone.&quot; But the river spirit out of gratitude to the Bodhisatta made a fish swallow the parcel. The fish was later caught and hawked about, and, owing again to the influence of the spirit, the fisherman asked one thousand pieces and seven annas for it, and the people laughed at what they thought was a joke. But when they came to the Bodhisatta's house, they offered him the fish for seven annas. The fish was bought and cut open by his wife, and the money was given to him. At that instant the river spirit informed him of what she had done and asked him to have no consideration for his brother, who was a thief and was greatly disappointed at the failure of his trick.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Makkhali Gosála&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the six heretical teachers contemporaneous with the Buddha. He held (*1) that there is no cause, either ultimate or remote, for the depravity of beings or for their rectitude. The attainment of any given condition or character does not depend either on one's own acts, nor on the acts of another, nor on human effort. There is no such thing as power or energy or human strength or human vigour. All beings (sattá), all lives (páná), all existent things (bhútá), all living substances (jívá), (*2) are bent this way and that by their fate, by the necessary conditions of the class to which they belong, by their individual nature; it is according to their position in one or other of the six classes (abhijáti) that they experience ease or pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are fourteen hundred thousands of principle genera or species (pamukhayoniyo), again six thousand others and again six hundred. There are five hundred kinds of kamma - there are sixty two paths (or modes of conduct), sixty two periods, six classes among men, eight stages of a prophet’s existence (atthapurisabhúmi), (*3) forty nine hundred kinds of occupation, forty nine hundred Ájívakas, forty nine hundred Wanderers (Paribbájaka), forty nine hundred Nága abodes (or species), two thousand sentient existences (víse indriyasate), three thousand infernal states, thirty six celestial, mundane or passionate grades (rajodhátuyo), seven classes of animate beings (saññigabbhá), or beings with the capacity of generating by means of separate sexes, seven of inanimate production (asaññigabbhá), seven of production by grafting (niganthagabbhá), seven grades of gods, men, devils, great lakes, precipices, dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*1) D.i.53 f. Makkhali, his views and his followers are </data>
<data>  also referred to at M.i.231, 238, 483, 516f.; S.i.66, 68; iii.211; iv.398;   A.i.33f., 286; iii.276, 384; also J.i.493, 509; S.iii.69 ascribes the first   portion of the account of Makkhali's views (as given in D.i.53)     that there is no cause, no reason for depravity or purity   to   Púrana Kassapa. A.i.286 apparently confounds Makkhali with Ajita Kesakambala,   and A.iii.383f. represents Púrana Kassapa as though he were a disciple of   Makkhali.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*2) Buddhaghosa (DA.i.160 ff.) gives details of these   four classes showing how they are meant to include all that has life on this   earth, from men down to plants. But the explanation is very confused and makes   the terms by no means mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*3) Buddhaghosa gives them as babyhood, playtime, trial   time, erect time, learning time, ascetic time, prophet time, and prostrate   time, with (very necessary) comments on each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are eighty four thousand periods during which both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, shall at last make an end of pain. This cannot be done by virtue, or penance, or righteousness. Ease and pain, measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of transmigration (samsára); there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof   both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, exactly for the allotted term, shall then, and then only, make an end of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makkhali's views as given in the Buddhist books are difficult to understand, the Commentators themselves finding it a hopeless task. He seems to have believed in infinite gradations of existence; in his view, each individual thing has eternal existence, if not individually, at least in type. He evidently had definite conceptions of numerous grades of beings, celestial, </data>
<data>infernal and mundane, as also of the infinity of time and the recurrent cycles of existence. He seems to have conceived the world as a system in which everything has a place and a function assigned to it, a system in which chance has no place and which admits of no other cause whatever, of the depravity or purity of beings, but that which is implied in the word Fate or Destiny (niyati). All types of things and all species of beings, however, are individually capable of transformation that is of elevation or degradation in type. His theory of purification through transmigration (samsárasuddhi) probably meant perfection through transformation (parinatá) -  transformation which implies not only the process of constant change, but also a fixed orderly mode of progression and retrogression. All things must, in course of time, attain perfection (for a discussion on Makkhali and his doctrines see Barua: Pre buddhistic Indian Philosophy, 297ff). Makkhali's followers are known as the Ájívakas (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the books, the Buddha considered Makkhali as the most dangerous of the heretical teachers: &quot;I know not of any other single person fraught with such loss to many folk, such discomfort, such sorrow to devas and men, as Makkhali, the infatuate (A.i.33). The Buddha also considered his view the meanest -  just as the hair blanket is reckoned the meanest of all woven garments, even so, of all the teachings of recluses, that of Makkhali is the meanest (A.i.286). Buddhaghosa (DA.i.166f) draws particular distinction between the moral effect of Makkhali's doctrine on the one hand and that of the doctrines of Púrana Kassapa and Ajita on the other. Púrana, by his theory of the passivity of the soul, denied action; Ajita, by his annihilationistic theory denied retribution; whereas Makkhali, by his doctrine of fate or non causation, denied both action and its result.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Very little is known of the name and the life of Makkhali. The Buddhist records call him Makkhali Gosála. Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.143f; MA.i.422) that he was once employed as a servant; one day, while carrying an oil-pot along a muddy road, he slipped and fell through carelessness, although warned thus by his master: &quot;Má khali,&quot; (stumble not) -  hence his name. When he found that the oil pot was broken, he fled; his master chased him and caught him by his garment, but he left it and ran along naked. He was; called Gosála, because he was born in a cow shed. According to Jaina records (e.g. Uvásaga-dasáo, p.1), he is called Gosála Mankhaliputta; he was born at Saravana near Sávatthi, his father's name being Mankhali and his mother's Bhaddá. His father was a Mankha   i.e., a dealer in pictures-  and Gosála followed this profession until he became a monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The philosopher's true name (Barua, op. cit., 298) seems to have been Maskarin, the Jaina Prakrit form of which is Mankhali and the Páli form Makkhali. &quot;Maskarin&quot; is explained by Pániní (VI.i.154) as &quot;one who carries a bamboo staff&quot; (maskara). A Maskarin is also known as Ekadandin. According to Patañjali (Mahábhásya iii.96), the name indicates a School of Wanderers who were called Maskarins, not so much because they carried a bamboo staff as because they denied the freedom of the will. The Maskarins were thus fatalists or determinists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Mágandiya Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;The conversation between Mágandiya and the Buddha after the former had offered the Buddha his daughter in marriage. Mágandiya expresses the view that purity comes from philosophy, from disputations and discussions, learning and. austerities. The Buddha denies this, and says that purity comes from inward peace. The sage (muni) is a confessor of peace and does not indulge in disputes. SN. vs. 835 47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mágandiya Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Records the conversation between the Buddha and the paribbájaka Mágandiya. Mágandiya says the Buddha is a repressionist (bhunahu) and this the Buddha denies, saying that he teaches only the subjugation of the senses, knowing their origin and their cessation; he has discarded all craving after them and dwells with his heart at peace. He then relates how, in his youth, he had enjoyed the greatest and most luxurious kinds of sensuous pleasures and had renounced them. He could no more crave for them than a leper, cured of his disease, craves for his old sores. Both the Buddha and teachers of other persuasions are convinced that health is the greatest boon and Nibbána the highest bliss. But the Buddha's conception of health and Nibbána differs from that of other teachers. Their knowledge is as that of a blind man, taken on trust. Mágandiya listens and is convinced. He enters the Order and becomes an arahant. M.i.501 13; Thomas: op. cit., 115.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

All these friends used to eat at his house, where they were well looked after. But the wife died, and they all lamented greatly.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Madda&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a country and its people (Maddá). In the Kusa Játaka (q.v.), Kusa, son of Okkáka, king of Kusávatí in the Malla country, is mentioned as having married Pabhávatí, daughter of the king of Madda, and the capital of the Madda king was Ságala (J.v.283ff.; Kusávati was one hundred leagues from Ságala (J.v.290), cp. Mtu.ii.441f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the similar story of Anitthigandha, a prince of Benares contracts a marriage with a daughter of the king of Ságala   his name being Maddava; but the girl dies on the way to her husband. (SNA.i.68f.; cp. DhA.iii.281, about the other Anitthigandha of Sávatthi of the Buddha's days, who also married a Madda princess). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chaddanta Játaka also mentions a matrimonial alliance between the royal houses of Benares and Ságala, while in the Kálingabodhi Játaka (J.iv.230f ) the Madda king’s daughter marries a prince of Kálinga while both are in exile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.v.39f.; so also in the Múgapakkha Játaka (J.vi.1), the wife of the Kási king was the daughter of the king of Madda, Candadevi by name; while Phusatí, wife of Sañjaya of Jetuttara in the Sivi kingdom and mother of Vessantara, was also a Madda princess (J.vi.480); likewise Maddí, wife of Vessantara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cúlani, son of Talatá, also married a princess of Madda (J.vi.471). According to the Mahávamsa (Mhv.viii.7; this probably refers to Madras and not to the Madda country, whose capital was Ságala), Sumitta, son of Síhabáhu and king of Síhapura, married the daughter of the Madda king and had three sons by him, the youngest of whom, Panduvásudeva, became king of Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddá Kápilání wife of Pippalimánava (Mahá Kassapa), was the daughter of a Kosiyagotta brahmin of Ságala in the Madda country. Men went </data>
<data>there in search of a wife for him because it was famed for the beauty of its women (Maddarattham náma itthágáro) (ThagA.ii.142; ThigA.68). Anojá, wife ofMahá Kappina of Kukkutavatí, also came from the royal household of Madda (DhA.ii.116), as did Khemá, wife of Bimbisára (ThigA.127).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wife of a Cakkavattí comes either from Uttarakuru or from the royal family of Madda (MA.ii.950; DA.ii.626; KhA.173).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the identification of Madda see Ságala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, when Tissá and her husband were talking together, Mattá was seized with jealousy and threw a heap of dirt on Tissá's head. After death, Mattá was born as a petí and suffered grievously. She appeared before Tissá, and, at her request, Tissá, gave alms to eight monks, giving the merit to Mattá. Mattá immediately won heavenly bliss.

As a result of this gift she became the queen of Vankanásikatissa. Later she bought the piece of land for one thousand and built there the vihára. Gajabáhukagámaní built a stone thúpa connected with it and gave lands to the monks of the vihára (Mhv.xxxiii.104ff., 115ff). The full name of this vihára seems to have been Rájamátuvihára (q.v.).

So he went up to the man and said, &quot; Hi! My man! Give me some meat,&quot; and the hunter gave him some skin and bone; the second, going up to him addressed him as &quot;Elder Brother&quot; and was given a joint; but the third cajoled him, calling him &quot;Father,&quot; and received a savoury piece of meat; while the fourth (the Bodhisatta) addressed him as &quot;Friend,&quot; and was given the whole of the rest of the deer, and the meat was conveyed to his house in the man's cart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Sáriputta. Some monks of Jetavana, having taken oil as a purgative, wished for some dainty food. They sent their attendants to beg in the cooks' quarters, but these had to come back empty handed. Sáriputta met them, and, having heard their story, returned with them to the same street; the people gave him a full measure of dainty fare, which was distributed among the sick monks.

When Mahosadha wished to find out the plans of Cúlaní Brahmadatta, he sent Máthara to the mynah that lived in Cúlaní's bedchamber. Máthara made love to her, pretending that he had come from Aritthapura to ask her to marry him, because his first wife (also a mynah) had been killed by a hawk. He related the stories of Vásudeva and Jambávatí and of Vaccha and Rattavatí, to prove that husband and wife need not be equal in birth. Having won her heart and discovered Cúlaní's secrets, Máthara flew back to Mahosadha (J.vi.418ff). He is identified with Ananda. J.vi.478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mátangaputta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of Mátanga, a landowner of Kosala. He was idle, and, when rebuked, joined the monks, hoping thus to have an easy life. But one day he heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order, and not long after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a mighty Nága king, and, seeing the Buddha travelling through the air, he honoured him by giving him his throat jewel (Thag.vss.231 3; ThagA.i.348ff). He is probably identical with Manipújaka Thera of the Apadána. Ap.ii.413f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha explains that his tenets are such that they avoid all strife and make a man dwell above all pleasures of sense, etc. Dandapáni shakes his head and walks on, without comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening the Buddha visits the Nigrodháráma and tells the monks there briefly how to get rid of all obsessions, so that all evil and wrong states of mind are quelled and pass away entirely. After the Buddha’s departure the monks seek Mahá Kaccána and ask him to expound in detail what the Buddha has told them in brief. Kaccána explains that where there is eye and visible form, visual consciousness arises, this begets contact, contact conditions feeling, what a man feels he perceives, what he perceives he reasons about, and this leads to obsession. It is the same with the other senses. The monks report this explanation to the Buddha, who approves of it and praises Kaccána's earning and insight. Ananda praises the discourse, comparing it to a honeyed pill of delicious savour, and the Buddha suggests that the sutta should be remembered by that name (Madhupindika) (M.i.108-14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nágita was; among those present when the sutta was preached. He was thereby persuaded to enter the Order, and soon after became an arahant. ThagA.i.183.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mátuposaka Játaka (No. 455)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as an elephant in the Himálaya and looked after his blind mother, who lived near Mount Candorana. One day he met a forester who had lost his way, and, feeling sorry for him, the elephant set him on the right path, carrying him on his back. But the forester was wicked, and, on his return to Benares, told the king about the elephant. The king asked him to fetch the elephant, who, seeing the forester approaching, meekly followed him lest his virtue be impaired. The elephant was received in the city with great pomp and placed in the royal stables as the state elephant, but he would touch no morsel of food. The king enquired into this and learnt of the elephant's blind mother. Thereupon the elephant was set free, and returned to the Himálaya amid the applause of the people. The king built a town near the elephant's dwelling, where he showed him great honour, and later, when, at his mother's death, the elephant went away to the Karandaka monastery to wait on the ascetics there, the king did the same for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who tended his mother. For details see the Sáma Játaka. Ananda is identified with the king, whose name is given as Vedeha, and Mahámáyá with the mother-elephant (J.iv.90 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.13) calls this the Mátuposaka Nágarája&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt; Játaka and gives the name of the elephant as Dhanapála. It was related to the four sons of a brahmin who waited on their aged father. The audience shed floods of tears, so greatly were they moved, and the brahmin and his sons became sotápannas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was told to a backsliding monk who, while travelling in Sávatthi for alms, saw an attractively dressed woman and fell in love with her. This was reported to the Buddha, who told him this story to show that lust could never be satisfied. At the end of the discourse the monk, with many others, became a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DhA.iii.240 gives a different occasion for the story; but that, too, refers to a discontented monk.

They had a dispute as to which was the cold part of the month, the dark half or the light, and they referred the matter to a hermit (the Bodhisatta), who said that the cold was caused by wind and not by light or darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to two forest dwelling monks of Kosala, Kála and Junha, who consulted the Buddha in a similar dispute. The lion and the tiger are identified with the monks. J.i.164ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Maddí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wife of Vessantara whose first cousin she was, being the daughter of the Madda king. When Vessantara went into exile, she, with her two children, Jáli and Kanhájiná, accompanied him. At Vankagiri she and the children occupied one of the hermitages provided for them by Vissakamma, at Sakka's orders. While she was getting fruit and leaves, Jújaka obtained from Vessantara the two children as slaves. Maddí the previous night had had a dream warning her of this, but Vessantara had consoled her. When she came back from her quest for food later than usual, the gods having contrived to detain her, she found the children missing, and searched for them throughout the night. It was at dawn the next day, on her recovery from a death like swoon, that Vessantara told her of the gift of the children, describing the miracles, which had attended the gift and showing how they presaged that he would reach Enlightenment. Maddí, understanding, rejoiced herself in the gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day Sakka appeared in the guise of a brahmin and asked Vessantara, to give him Maddí as his slave. Seeing him hesitate, Maddí urged him to let her go, saying that she belonged to him to do as he would with her. The gift was made and accepted by Sakka. He then, however, gave her back, with praises of Vessantara and Maddí.

One day, at her request, they prepared some sweetmeats, and, placing them in a cart, started for Benares to see her patents. On the way Sujátá was seen by the king of Benares, and, wishing to possess her, he ordered the jewel of his diadem to be introduced into the Bodhisatta's cart. The cry of &quot; thief &quot; was then set up, and the Bodhisatta arrested and taken off to be executed. But Sakkas throne was heated by Sujátá's lamentations, and, descending to earth, Sakka made the king and the Bodhisatta change places. The king was beheaded, and Sakka, revealing himself, set the Bodhisatta on the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devatattas attempts to kill the Buddha. The king is identified with Devadatta, Sakka with Anuruddha, and Ráhulamátá with Sujátá (J.ii.121 5). The story gives the case of a man getting happiness through a virtuous woman.

It could be seen from the Indasála guhá (ThagA.i.333). The contour of the field struck the Buddha's imagination and he asked Ananda to design a robe of the same pattern. Ananda did this very successfully, and this pattern has been adopted for the robes of members of the Order ever since (Vin.i.287).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Suvannnakakkata Játaka (J.iii.293; also iv.277) mentions a field of one thousand karísas (about eight thousand acres) in a brahmin village called SáIindiya to the east of Rájagaha. Magadhakhetta may sometimes have been used as another name for Magadha. See, e.g., AA.i.126, where NáIakagáma is mentioned as having been in Magadhakhetta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahiyangana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A locality in the old Mahánága garden, on the banks of the Maháválukagangá. It was there that the Buddha hovered in the air on his first visit to Ceylon, in order to frighten the Yakkhas. Later, Mahásumana built there a shrine seven cubits in diameter, all of sapphire, and containing the hair given to him by the Buddha. After the Buddha's death, Sarabhú, a disciple of Sáriputta, brought there the collar bone of the Buddha, which he deposited in the thúpa, increasing the height of the thúpa to twelve cubits. Uddhacúlábhaya raised it to thirty cubits, while Dutthagámaní, dwelling there during his campaign against the Damila Chatta, increased it to eighty cubits (Mhv.i.24, 33ff.; xxv.7; Cv. Trs.i.154, n.3). Vohárika Tissa erected a parasol over the thúpa (Mhv.xxxvi.34). Attached to the thúpa was a vihára, near which lived the three Lambakannas, Sanghatissa, Sanghabodhi and Gothábhaya (Mhv.xxxvi.58).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later times, Sena II. gave maintenance villages to the vihára (Cv.li.74), as did also Kassapa IV. (Cv.lii.14). Vijayabáhu I. found the vihára in a bad state of decay and had it restored, (Cv.lx.59) while Parakkamabáhu VI. carried out repairs to the thúpa (Cv.xci.29). King Víravikamma went from his capital to Mahiyangana, a distance of seven gávutas on foot, and held a great festival in honour of the thúpa (Cv.xcii.17). King Narindasíha is mentioned as having visited Mahiyangana three times   once alone and twice with his army   and as having held magnificent festivals in its honour (Cv.xcvii.27ff). Vijayarájasíha held a festival there (Cv.xcviii.85), as did Kittisirirájasíha, who made a pilgrimage to the spot (Cv.xcix.38); he also made arrangements for travelers from Siam to Ceylon to visit the spot and hold celebrations there (Cv.c.125ff).

He married, and, on the birth of a son, he entrusted wife and child to his younger brother and became an ascetic. When the boy began to grow up, the brother drowned him in the river lest he should claim half the estate. The Bodhisatta saw this with his divine eye and called on his brother, to whom he pointed out the folly of covetousness – “You are like the bird, Mayhaka, who sits on the pipal tree and keeps on crying 'Mine, mine,' while the other birds eat the fruit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a wealthy man of Sávatthi, a stranger who settled down there. He neither enjoyed his wealth nor gave it to others, living in poverty, eating rice dust and sour gruel, and travelling in a broken down chariot with a parasol of leaves. He died without issue and his money, passed to the king. When the king told the Buddha of this, the Buddha explained to him that the miser had, in a previous birth, met the Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikhí begging for alms and had sent word to his wife to give the food prepared for himself. This the wife gladly did. But the man saw Tagarasikhí with his bowl full of sweet foods and repented of his generosity. Therefore, in this birth, though possessing much wealth, he never enjoyed it. He was childless because he was the very man who had drowned the Bodhisatta's son. J.iii.299-303.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the Vidhura Pandita Játaka (J. i.280) the Macchá are mentioned among those who witnessed the game of dice between the king of the Kurus and Punnaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Macchá country lay to the south or south west of Indraprastha and to the south of Súrasena. Its capital was Virátanagara or Vairát, so called because it was the city of King Viráta. Rv.vii.6, 18; Law: Anct. Geog. Of India, p. 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The sutta describes thirty seven mangaláni, including such things as the avoidance of fools, association with the wise, honouring those worthy of honour, etc. (Khp.pp.2f)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (KhpA.vii.; SNA.i.300) explains that at the time the sutta was preached there was great discussion over the whole of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')"&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/a&gt; regarding the constitution of mangala. The devas heard the discussion and argued among themselves till the matter spread to the highest Brahma world. Then it was that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; suggested that a devaputta should visit the Buddha and ask him about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sutta_nipata')"&gt;Sutta Nipáta&lt;/a&gt; (SN., pp. 46f) the sutta is called Mahámangala. It is one of the suttas at the preaching of which countless devas were present and countless beings realized the Truth (SNA.i.174; BuA.243; AA.i.57,320).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is often recited, and forms one of the commonest of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paritta')"&gt;Parittas&lt;/a&gt;. To have it written down in a book is considered an act of great merit (MA.ii.806).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mhv.xxxii.43) that once&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dutthagaamanii')"&gt;Dutthagámani&lt;/a&gt; attempted to preach the Mangala Sutta at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lohapasada')"&gt;Lohapásáda&lt;/a&gt;, but he was too nervous to proceed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preaching of the Mangala Sutta was one of the incidents of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha's&lt;/a&gt; life represented in the Relic Chamber of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahathupa')"&gt;Mahá Thúpa&lt;/a&gt; (Mhv.xxx. 83).  &lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Maddakucchi&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A park near Rájagaha, at the foot of Gijjhakúta. It was a preserve (migadáya) where deer and game could dwell in safety. When Devadatta, wishing to kill the Buddha, hurled a rock down Gijjhakúta, it was stopped midway by another rock, but a splinter from it fell on the Buddha's foot, wounding it severely. As the Buddha suffered much from loss of blood, the monks took him on a litter to Maddakucchi, and from there to the Jívaka-ambavana, where he was treated by Jivaka (Vin.ii.193f.; DhA.ii.164ff.; J.iv.430; Mil.179). It is said (S.i.27f) that seven hundred devas of the Satullapa group visited the Buddha there and told him of their great admiration for his qualities. Mára tried to stir up discontent in the Buddha, but had to retire discomfited (S.i.110; this visit of Mára is referred to at D.ii.116).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentaries (e.g., S.A.i.61; cp. J.iii.121f), Maddakucchi was so called because it was there that Bimbisára's queen, mother of Ajátasattu, tried to bring about an abortion when she was told by soothsayers that the child in her womb was destined to bring about Bimbisára's death. She went into the park unknown to the king and violently massaged her womb, but without success. The king heard of this and forbade her to visit the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Mahá Kappina was at Maddakucchi, doubts arose in his mind as to the necessity of joining the assembly of monks for the holding of uposatha, he himself being pure. The Buddha read his thoughts, appeared before him, and urged upon him the necessity of so doing (Vin.i.105).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maddakucchi was difficult of access monks; who came from afar late at night, wishing to put Dabba Mallaputta's powers to the test, would often ask him to provide lodging there for them.

When his parents died, his brother managed the estate. Some time later the brother also died, but the Bodhisatta shed no tear. His relations and friends called him heartless, but he convinced them that he did not weep because he knew that all things are transient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a landowner of Sávatthi who gave himself up to despair on the death of his brother. The Buddha visited him and preached to him, and the man became a sotápanna. J.iii.56 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

During the Akkhakkháyika famine, Dutthagámaní provided him and four others with a dish of sour millet gruel, which was purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the king's earrings (Mhv.xxxii.30). Mahádeva took his portion to Sumanakúta and shared it with nine hundred others (Mhv.xxxii.49). He was also among the eight arahants who accepted a meal of pork from Sáliya in his previous birth as a blacksmith (MT.606). He was probably so called because he lived at Kotapabbata in the Malaya country. MT.606 he is called Kotapabbatavásika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that for three years after his ordination Mahádeva lived in the Maindalárámaka vihára (Mahádeva called Maliyadeva in the context (AA.i.22), but further on in the same passage (p.23) he is addressed as Mahádeva). One day, while going for alms in Kallagáma, near by, he was invited by an upásiká to her dwelling, where she gave him a meal, and, regarding him as a son, invited him to take all his meals at her home. The invitation was accepted, and each day, after the meal, he would return thanks with the words &quot;May you be happy and free from sorrow&quot; (sukham hotu, dukkhá mucca). At the end of the rainy season he became an arahant, and the chief incumbent of the Vihára entrusted him with the task of preaching to the assembled people on the Pavárana Day. The young novices informed the upásiká that her &quot;son&quot; would preach that day, but she, thinking they were making fun of her, said that not everyone could preach. But they persuaded her to go to the vihára, and, when the turn of Maliyadeva came, he preached all through the night. At dawn he stopped, and the upásiká became a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maliyadeva once preached the Cha Chakka Sutta in the </data>
<data>Lohápásáda, and sixty monks, who listened to him, became arahants. He also preached the same sutta in the Mahámandapa, in the Mahávihára, at Cetíyapabbata, at Sákyavamsa vihára, at Kutáli vihára, at Antara-sobbha, Mutingana, Vátakapabbata, Pácínagharaka, Díghavápí, Lokandara, and Gamendavála, and, at each place, sixty monks attained arahantship. At Cittalapabbata he saw a monk of over sixty preparing to bathe at Kuruvakatittha, and asked permission to bathe him. The Elder, discovering from his conversation that he was Maliyadeva, agreed to let him do so, though, he said, no one had ever touched his body during sixty years. Later in the day, the Elder begged Maliyadeva to preach to him, and this he did. Sixty monks, all over sixty, were among the audience, and at the conclusion of the Cha Chakka Sutta they all became arahants. The same thing happened at Tissamahávihára, Kalyáni vihára, Nágamahávihara, Kalacchagáma, and at other places, sixty in all (MA.ii.1024f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaya Mahádeva was among those various large groups who renounced the world in the company of the Bodhisatta: the Kuddálasamágama, Múgapakkha samágama, Cúlasutasoma samágama, Ayogharapandita samágama and Hatthipála samágama (J.iv.490; also vi.30, where Mahámaliyadeva is called Kálavelavásí). It is said (Vsm.241) that two monks once asked Malaya Mahádeva for a subject of meditation, and that he gave them the formula of the thirty two parts of the body. Though versed in the three Nikáyas, the monks could not become sotápannas until they had recited the formula for a period of four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Majjhantika Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He recited the kammavácá (or ecclesiastical act) at the ordination of Mahinda, on whom he later conferred the upasampadá ordination (Mhv.v.207; Sp.i.51; Dpv.vii.24). Later, at the conclusion of the Third Council, Majjhantika went as preacher to Kasmíra Gandhára. There, by his great iddhi powers, he overcame the Nága king Aravála and converted him to the Faith, while Pandaka and his wife Háritá and their five hundred sons became sotápannas. Majjhantika preached the Ásívisopama Sutta to the assembled concourse and later ordained one hundred thousand persons (Mhv.xii.3, 9ff.; Sp.i.64ff.; Dpv.viii.4; Mbv.113; for the Tibetan version see Rockhill, op. cit., 167ff.). The sermon preached by Majjhantika is referred to in the Scholiast to the Sarabhanga Játaka (J.v.142).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This same Elder is referred to elsewhere as an example of one who practised pariyatti appicchatá (SNA.ii.494; DA.iii.1061, but at AA.i.263 he is called Majjhantika Tissa). He was the leader of the assembly of monks (sanghathera). On the day of the dedication of Asoka’s vihára, the Thera was a khínásava and was present, but his begging bowl and robe were hardly worth a farthing. People, seeing him there, asked him to make way; but he sank into the earth, rising to receive the alms given to the leader of the monks, knowing that he alone was fit to accept it. The story is given at AA.i.43; MA.i.350.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His father loved him dearly, but was a great miser, and made for him, with his own hands, a pair of burnished ear rings in order to save the goldsmith's fee; the boy thus came to be called Mattakundali (burnished ear rings). When he was sixteen he had an attack of jaundice. His father refused to call in a physician, and prescribed for him himself till the boy was beyond all cure. Then he carried him out and laid him on the terrace, lest those who came to prepare for the funeral should see his wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha saw Mattakundali as he lay dying, and, out of compassion, came to the door of his father's house. Too weak to do anything else, the boy conjured up devout faith in the Buddha; he died soon after, and was born among the gods in a golden mansion thirty leagues in extent. When he surveyed his past birth, he saw his father in the charnel ground, weeping and lamenting and preparing to cremate his body. Assuming the form of Mattakundali, he went himself to the charnel ground and, standing near, started to weep. When questioned by Adinnapubbaka, he said he wanted the moon, and in the course of conversation he revealed his identity and censured his father. Adinnapubbaka invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, and, when it was over, asked if it were possible to attain to heaven by a mere act of faith. In order to convince him, the Buddha made Mattakundali appear before him and confirm his statement that this was so. At the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon, both Adinnapubbaka and Mattakundali became sotápannas, and eighty thousand persons realized the Truth (Mil.350). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DhA.i.20ff.; Vv.vii.9; VvA.322ff.; Pv.ii.5; PvA.92; the stanzas found in Mattakundali's story occur also in the Mattakundali Játaka </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Máratajjaníya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiftieth sutta of the Majjhima Nikáya. While &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; is living at&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhesakalavava')"&gt;Bhesakalávana&lt;/a&gt;, Mára enters his belly and worries him. When Mára realizes that Moggallána has discovered him and can read his thoughts, he leaves his body and perches on the door bar of his cell. Moggallána then addresses him and tells him how, once, he himself was a Mára named Dúsí, and roused the brahmin householders against Kakusandha Buddha and his disciples. As a result of this, Dúsí was born in Mahániraya and suffered great torments. Moggallána warns Mára against assailing holy men lest he suffer a similar fate. Mára retires discomfited. M.i.332-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

As he stood one day looking   at a ploughed field a sign arose in him of the size of the field. He enlarged   it, induced the five jhánas, and, developing insight, became an arahant   (Vsm.123).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is mentioned as consulting Díghabhánaka Abhaya on some problem   connected with jhána.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Manikundala Játaka (No. 351)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, born as king of Benares, discovering that one of his ministers had intrigued in his harem, expelled him from the kingdom. The minister took up service under the king of Kosala, and, as a result of his conspiracy, the Bodhisatta was taken captive and cast into prison (J.iii.153ff). For the rest of the story see Ekarája Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a councillor of Pasenadi who was guilty of misconduct in the harem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

(Cv.li.72). Among the canals flowing into the tank was the Tilavatthuka, restored by Vijayabáhu I. (Cv.lx.53). Parakkamabáhu I. rebuilt the tank (Cv.lxxix.31), and constructed the Kálindí Canal to carry away the overflow from the south side (Cv.xlii.54). It was near this tank that Sanghatissa was taken prisoner by the followers of Moggallána III. Cv.xliv.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Márakáyika devi&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of devas, evidently followers of Mára, who were credited by the Pubbaseliyas and Aparaseliyas with making arahants discharge seminal fluid, though neither the arahants nor the devas themselves were guilty of physical impurity (Kvu. 164f.). One of these devas once entered the bodies of five hundred women, friends of Visákhá, made them drunk, and caused them to commit gross improprieties in the presence of the Buddha.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Majjhimadesa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country of Central India which was the birthplace of Buddhism and the region of its early activities. It extended in the east to the town of Kajangala, beyond which was Mahásála; on the south-east to the river Salalavatí; on the south west to the town of Satakannika; on the west to the brahmin village of Thúna; on the north to the Usiraddhaja Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vin.i.197; J.i.49, 80; Mbv.12; Dvy.21f, extends the eastern boundary to include Pundavardhana, roughly identical with North Bengal. It is interesting to note that in early Brahminical literature (e.g. the Dharmasútra of Baudháyana), Áryávarta, which is practically identical with what came to be called Madhyadesa, is described as lying to the east of the region where the Sarasvatí disappears, to the west of the Kálakavana, to the north of Páripátra, and to the south of the Himálaya. This excludes the whole of Magadha (Baudháyana i. 1, 2, 9, etc.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also noteworthy that in the Commentaries the Majjhimadesa is extended to include the whole of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')"&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/a&gt;, the other continents being Paccantima-janapadá. The term came also to be used in a generic sense. Thus, in Ceylon (Tambapannidípa) &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura')"&gt;Anurádhapura&lt;/a&gt; came to be called the Majjhimadesa (AA.i.165).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhimadesa was three hundred yojanas in length, two hundred and fifty in breadth, and nine hundred in circumference (DA.i.173). It contained fourteen of the sixteen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada')"&gt;Mahájanapadas&lt;/a&gt;, that is to say all but Gandhára and Kamboja, which belonged to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttaraapatha')"&gt;Uttarápatha&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Majjhimadesa were regarded as wise and virtuous (J.iii.115, 116). It was the </data>
<data>birthplace of noble men (purisájaníyá) including the Buddhas (DhA.iii.248; AA.i.265), and all kinds of marvellous things happened there (SNA.i.197). The people of Majjhimadesa considered peacocks' flesh a luxury. VibhA.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mandákiní&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the seven great lakes of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava')"&gt;Himálaya&lt;/a&gt;. Their names are given at J.v.415; A.iv.101; SNA.ii.407; DA.i.164; UdA.300; AA.ii.759. At Vsm.416, the name Tiyaggalá is substituted for Mandákiní. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chaddanta')"&gt;Chaddantavana&lt;/a&gt; and is fifty leagues in extent, of which twenty-five leagues is of crystal water, free from moss or weeds. For the next twenty five leagues, the water is but waist deep and is covered with white lotus, spreading for half a league around the lake; beyond that are red lotus, red lilies, etc., rice fields, fruit trees, a grove of sugar cane - each cane being as big as a palm tree banana, jak, mango, rose apple, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bank of the lake is a spot where Pacceka Buddha's generally live; but &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/annaa_kondanna')"&gt;Aññá-Kondañña&lt;/a&gt; lived there for twelve years attended by Chaddanta, the elephant and Nágadatta, a devaputta. They ministered to all his needs, and he only left there to take leave of the Buddha before his death. He then returned to Mandákiní, where he died and was cremated, his relics being later deposited at the gateway of Veluvana, where a cetiya was erected over them. SA.i.217ff.; but see ThagA.ii.3, where he is said to have lived on the bank of the Chaddantadaha; Mandákiní may have been another name for the same lake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mandákiní Lake never grows hot and dries up only at the end of the kappa.

Being a bigoted Hindu, he destroyed the Buddhist religious buildings and burnt their books. He persecuted the people in various ways and distributed their land among his warriors. He ruled for twenty one years, and seems to have been succeeded at Pulatthipura by Jayabáhu (q.v.) (Cv.lxxx.58ff). During part of his reign, Vijayabáhu III. (q.v.) ruled over a portion of Ceylon.

One day he entered &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and took up his residence in the royal park. The king, pleased with his demeanour, invited him into the palace and asked him to spend the rainy season in the park. The king had an ill-natured son, named Dutthakumára, and despairing of ever being able to reform him, handed him over, as a last resort, to the ascetic. One day, when the ascetic was walking about in the garden with the prince, he asked him to taste the leaf of a young Nimba-plant. The prince did so, but at once spat it out, because of its intense bitterness. &quot;If such bitterness should reside in the baby-tree, how will it be when it grows up?&quot; said the Bodhisatta, and thereupon drew a moral with regard to the prince's own conduct. The prince benefited by the lesson, and thenceforth changed his nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a Licchavi-Kumára called Duttha.

The king of Kosala invaded his father's kingdom and, having killed the king, took away the queen, who was pregnant. When the child was born he was cast into the cemetery lest he should be slain by the Kosala king. The boy was discovered by a goatherd and brought up as his son, but from the day of the boy's arrival in the goatherd's home, the latter's animals began to die off. He was therefore named Elakamára (&quot;Goat's Bane&quot;). The goatherd, thereupon, put him into a pot and cast him into the river, where he was picked up by a low-caste mender of old rubbish and adopted as his son. When he grew up the boy went to the palace with his father, and there the princess Kurangaví, of great beauty, fell in love with him. The servants discovered them guilty of illicit relations and reported them to the king. When the lad was about to be put to death for his misdemeanour, the queen; possessed by the spirit of Elakamára's dead father, who had been born as his guardian angel, confessed that he was no mere outcaste, but the son of the king of Benares. The Kosala king restored to Elakamára his father's inheritance and married him to Kurangaví. Chalangakumára was given to him as his teacher, and was later appointed commander-in-chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurangaví misbehaved with Chalangakumára as well as with his servant, Dhanantevásí (J.v.430ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Elakamára was one of the stories mentioned by Kunála in his famous sermon on the frailty of women (J.v.424).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

They were so called because they held that &quot;all the doctrines are understood by a unique and immediate wisdom, for all the doctrines of the Buddha are comprehended by the intellect.&quot; (Mhv.187f). They held, among other things, that the Tathágathas were not subject to worldly laws, that the Dhammacakkas of all Tathágathas did not agree; the Bodhisatta did not pass through the successive stages of embryonic development; that he is born at will among inferior beings for the salvation of mankind; with our wisdom the four truths are perfectly understood; he who has perfectly acquired right restraint has cast off all yoga (attachment).

Esukárí.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin who visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks him various questions on castes and their distinctions, from the point of view of their functions. The Buddha replies that birth's invidious bar has been laid down by the brahmins, without consulting anybody else; all four castes alike can live the good life, which is the true service, and follow the Dhamma, which is the true wealth. At the end of the discourse Esukárí declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha (M.ii.177ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Esukárí.&lt;/b&gt;-King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. He and his chaplain were great friends; neither of them had any sons. They agreed that if either of them should have a son the possessions of both should be given to him. By the intercession of a tree-sprite the chaplain had four sons - Hatthipála, Assapála, Gopála, and Ajapála. But when they grew up, one after the other, they renounced the world, and were later joined by the chaplain and the king, with all their retinues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esukárí was a previous birth of Suddhodana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is related in the Hatthipála Játaka. J.iv.473ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ekapundaríka.-A paribbájakáráma, the residence of Vacchagotta (M.i.481f ).It was near the Kútágárasálá in the Mahávana of Vesáli. The Buddha went there to see Vacchagotta, and it was on this occasion that the Tevijja-Vacchagotta Sutta was preached (M.i.481f). Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.673) that the place was so called because in it grew a solitary White Mango Tree (setambarukkha).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ekapundaríka.-An elephant belonging to Pasenadi. It was while riding on this elephant that the king met Ananda. The king followed the Elder to the monastery, and their conversation is recorded in the Báhitika Sutta (M.ii.112f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the elephant's ribs there was a white spot (pandaratthána), the size of a palmyra-fruit, hence his name (MA.ii.752).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Ekapundaríka Thera.-An arahant. Ninety-four kappas ago he met the Pacceka Buddha, Romasa, and gave him a lotus-flower as an offering of homage. Ap.i.238.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day his son, sitting on his lap, asked him for one word which comprehended all things. The Bodhisatta said it was &quot;skill&quot; (dakkhayya). The story was told in reference to a lad in Sávatthi who asked his father &quot;the Dvárapañha&quot; (question regarding the entrance to the Path). The father, not being able to answer the boy, brought him to the Buddha. J.ii.236f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ninety-four kappas ago he kept a lamp lighted all night near the thúpa built over the relics of Siddhattha Buddha. For seventy-seven kappas he was in heaven and was thirty-one times king of the devas. Twenty-eight times be was king among men. His body shone like the sun, and he could see a distance of one hundred leagues. His palace in heaven was called Ekadípi. He entered the Order at the age of four (?) and in a fortnight became an arahant. Ap.ii.373.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekadípiya Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant. In the past he had lighted a lamp before the salala-bodhi of the Buddha Padumuttara. Sixteen thousand kappas ago he was four times king under the name of Candábha.

In the past, ninety-one kappas ago, he was a potter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hamsavatii')"&gt;Hamsavatí&lt;/a&gt;, and once gave a well-made bowl of clay to the Buddha. As a result, he always had his food in gold and silver bowls (Ap.ii.444). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda')"&gt;Mahácunda Thera&lt;/a&gt;.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ekaputtika-Brahmadatta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. He had only one son, of whom he was extremely fond. One day when the king was enjoying himself in the royal park, the boy was suddenly taken ill and died at once. Lest the king should die of a broken heart, the ministers did not tell him for two days. The king thereupon reflected on the nature of death and developing insight became a Pacceka Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His verse is included in the Khaggavisána Sutta.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ekúposathiká Therí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arahant. In the past she was a slave-girl, a water-carrier in the city of Bandhumatí. Seeing the King Bandhumá keeping the fast, she took the precepts herself and kept them well. Sixty-four times she became the queen of rulers in heaven, and was sixty-three times queen among men. Her complexion was always of a golden hue. In her last life she left the world at the age of seven, and attained arahantship within eight months (Ap.ii.522f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is probably identical with Uttamá Therí.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Erakapatta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nága king. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk. One day, while in a boat, he grasped an eraka-leaf, and through his failing to let go, the leaf was broken off. Though he practised meditation for twenty thousand years in the forest, at the moment of his death he thought of the lapse with great remorse and was reborn in the Nága world as large as a dug-out canoe, much to his grief and despair. When a daughter was born to him he taught her a song and, once a fortnight, he appeared with her on the surface of the Ganges, where she danced on his hood and sang the song. She was offered in marriage to anyone who could sing a reply to her song. Erakapatta hoped thereby to become aware of it when a Buddha should appear in the world. Many suitors came, and an interval between two Buddhas passed and still no one was successful. At last a young brahmin, Uttara (q.v.), well-schooled for the task by the Buddha, appeared before the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nága-maiden and answered all her questions. (Uttara himself became a sotápanna when he finished learning his lesson from the Buddha.) Erakapatta at once knew that a Buddha had come, and asked Uttara to take him to the Teacher. At the sight of the Buddha, Erakapatta was seized with great sorrow on account of his condition, but the Buddha preached to him and consoled him. It is said that the Nága king would have attained the Fruit of Conversion had it not been for his animal nature. DhA.iii.230-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once, during the eleventh year of his ministry, the Buddha visited the village and preached to Kásí-Bháradvája the sutta which bears his name and which converted him to the faith (Sn.pp.12ff; SnA.i.136; S.i.172ff). Near the village was the Dakkhinagiri-vihára. SA.i.188.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic named Nárada-Kassapa, living near the mountain Kosika. Once he saw the Buddha walking through the forest, and having provided him with a seat, spoke words in praise of him. The Buddha preached to him a short sermon. Fifty times Ekásanadáyaka became king of the gods and eighty times he ruled over men. Wherever he wished he could find a seat, even in the forest or in a river (Ap.ii.381f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekásanadáyaka.&lt;/b&gt;-A Thera. In the time of Padumuttara, he, with his wife, left the deva-world, and coming amongst men waited upon a monk named Devala (Ap.i.226).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ekuddána (Ekuddániya) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He was the son of a wealthy brahmin of Sávatthi, and being convinced of the Buddha's majesty, as seen at the presentation of the Jetavana, he entered the Order. He dwelt in the forest fulfilling his novitiate, and once came to the Buddha to learn of him. The Buddha, seeing Sáriputta near him wrapt in contemplation, uttered a stanza, that to the monk of lofty thoughts and heedful, sorrow comes not (See Dhammapada, 259). The monk learnt this stanza, and returning to the forest, ever and anon reflected on it. He thus came to be called Ekuddániya. One day he obtained insight and became an arahant. Later, when Ananda asked him to preach a sermon, it was this stanza that he took as his text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are told that in the time of Atthadassí Buddha he was a chief of the yakkhas, and when the Buddha died he went about lamenting that he had not made use of his opportunities. A disciple of the Buddha, named Ságara, meeting him, advised him to make offering to the Buddha's thúpa. In Kassapa's time he was a householder, and heard the Buddha utter the stanza mentioned above. He entered the Order, and for twenty thousand years practised meditation, repeating the stanza, but gained no attainment (ThagA.i.153f; Thag.v.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DhA.iii.384f) that on fast-days Ekuddána, alone in the forest, sounded the call for the deities of the forest to attend the preaching of the Law, and uttered his stanza, whereupon the deities made loud applause. One fast-day two monks, versed in the Tipitaka, visited Ekuddána with a retinue of five hundred each. Seeing them, Ekuddána's heart was glad and he said: &quot;Today we will listen to the Law.&quot; On being asked for an explanation, he described how, when the Dhamma was expounded, the forest </data>
<data>grove was filled with the applause of devas. Thereupon one of the Elders recited the Dhamma and the other expounded it, but there was no sound. In order to dispel their doubts, Ekuddána took his seat and pronounced his one stanza. The sound of the plaudits of the devas filled the forest. The Elders were greatly offended at the conduct of the devas and complained to the Buddha. The Buddha explained to them that the important thing was not the amount of knowledge but the quality of the understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that the verse, attributed above to Ekuddániya, occurs in the Vinaya (Vin.iv.54) as having been constantly used by Cúlapanthaka. Whenever it was his turn to preach to the nuns at Sávatthi they expected no effective lesson, since he always repeated the same stanza, namely, that which is above attributed to Ekuddániya. The thera, bearing of their remarks, forthwith gives an exhibition of his iddhi-power and of his knowledge of the Dhamma, thereby winning their tribute of admiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the time of Kassapa Buddha he entered the Order and dwelt in solitude. In this life, too, he was fond of dwelling alone. Ap.ii.390f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

Erávana.&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka's&lt;/a&gt; elephant. He was once the elephant of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;, who gave him to&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagha')"&gt;Mágha&lt;/a&gt; and his companions to help them in their good works on earth. As a result, when Magha and the others were reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, Erávana was born there himself and became their companion. Ordinarily he was a deva like the others, because there are no animals in the deva-world, but when they went to the park to play, Erávana assumed the form of an elephant, one hundred and fifty leagues in size. For the thirty-three devas Erávana erected thirty-three heads (kumbha), each two or three quarters of a league in girth. Each head had seven tusks, each fifty leagues long, each tusk bore seven lotus plants, each plant seven flowers, each flower seven leaves, and on each leaf danced seven nymphs (Padumacehará). For Sakka himself there was a special head, Sudassana, thirty leagues around, above it a canopy of twelve leagues all of precious stones. In the centre was a jewelled couch one league long, on which Sakka reclined in state. DhA.i.273f; also SnA.i.368f. (where there are a few slight variations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammika_v_s')"&gt;Dhammika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (Sn.v.379) Erávana is mentioned among the devas who visited the Buddha to pay him homage. He is also mentioned among the Nágas present at the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s')"&gt;Mahásamaya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.258; perhaps here a king of snakes is meant, because he is mentioned with others who are avowedly snakes). It is emphasised in several places (E.g., MA.i.472; DA.ii.688; also VvA.15 and Kvu.ii.599) that Erávana is a devaputta and </data>
<data>a Nága only by birth (játiyá). The Játakas (J.v.137) mention Sakka as riding Erávana, particularly when making comparisons between kings parading on the backs of elephants (E.g., V.iii.392).

He was a native of Cola, and having come to Ceylon, overpowered the reigning king, Asela, and captured the throne. The Mahávamsa says (Mhv.xxi.14f ) that he ruled with &quot;even justice towards friend and foe,&quot; and many stories are related showing his love of fairness and his kindness. Although an unbeliever, he paid the greatest respect to Buddhism, and he is credited with having persuaded the gods, by his determination, to send rain over his kingdom only at convenient times. Elára had a general named Mitta (Mhv.xxiii.4); the chief of his forces was Díghajantu, while his royal elephant was called Mahápabbata. In the great battle between Elára's forces and the Sinhalese soldiers under Dutthagámaní, Elára was slain in single contest with the latter. In recognition of the dead king's chivalry, great honours were paid to him at his funeral and a monument was erected over his ashes. For many generations all music was stopped while passing the monument as a mark of respect to the honoured dead (Mhv.xxv.54-74; Dpv.xxiii.49ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahávamsa Tíká (p. 483), a shrine was erected on the spot where Elára's ashes were buried, and it was called the Elárapatimághara. It was to the south of Anurádhapura, beyond the potters' village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ekasátaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very poor brahmin who lived in the time of Vipassí Buddha. He was so called because he and his wife had, between them, only one upper garment, worn by whichever of them happened to be going out. The Buddha was in the habit of preaching every seven years. On one such occasion the brahmin listened to the Buddha's sermon, and being greatly pleased, wishing to make an offering, he gave the Buddha his upper garment after a hard mental struggle as to whether he could afford the gift. Having made the gift, he shouted with joy saying, &quot;I have won.&quot; The king of the city, Bandhumá, having heard the shout and learnt the reason, gave to the brahmin various rich gifts, including the sabbatthaka (*), all of which the latter presented to the Buddha, keeping, at the king's special request, a single pair of garments for himself and his wife. The king later made Ekasátaka his chaplain (AA.i.92ff; also ThagA.ii.136).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sabbatthaka seems to have been a gift of various things in groups of eight: eight elephants, eight horses, eight thousand pieces of money, etc. (DhA.iii.3); but see Mil.Trs.ii.147, n.1, where it is spoken of as an office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ekasátaka is given in the Anguttara Commentary (loc. cit.) as a previous birth of the Elder Mahá Kassapa. The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.1ff) mentions another brahmin, Culla-Ekasátaka by name. He is, however, stated as having lived in the time of Gotama Buddha, although the story related is, in most respects, identical with that given above, except that the king in the story of Culla-Ekasátaka is Pasenadi, king of Kosala. No mention is made of the brahmin being created purohita. Moreover, this brahmin received as gift only the sabbacatukka (groups of four) and not the </data>
<data>sabatthaka. More important still, Culla Ekasátaka is identified with Mahá Ekasátaka, the latter being mentioned as having lived in the time of Vipassí Buddha. Here we evidently have a confusion of legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Ekasátaka is related in the Milindapañha (pp.115, 291), as one of seven cases in which an act of devotion received its reward in this very life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the time of Atthadassí he was an ascetic with a large following, living on the banks of the Candabhágá. He visited the Buddha with his followers and held a white parasol over the Buddha's head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-seven kappas ago he lived in the deva-world as king of the devas. He was king of men one thousand times (Ap.ii.367ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Eraka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He was the son of an eminent family of Sávatthi. He had many advantages over others, among them beauty and charm. His parents married him to a suitable wife but, because it was his last life, he sought the Buddha. After hearing the Buddha preach he left the world, but for several days he was overcome by evil thoughts. The Buddha thereupon admonished him in a verse, and Eraka gained arahantship (Thag.v.93; ThagA.i.192f; for the name see Brethren, p.86, n.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a householder. One day he saw the Buddha and, having nothing to give, cleaned the road along which the Buddha walked and stood looking at him with clasped hands. Fifty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Suppabuddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Maggadáyaka Thera of the Apadána. Ap.i.173.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h1&gt;Theraváda-Buddhism &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many English web sites with Buddhist literature. The entire Tipitaka has been translated and is available in English language from the&lt;a href="http://www.palitext.demon.co.uk/"&gt;Pali Text Society&lt;/a&gt; in England.

Ekarája.&lt;/b&gt;-King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. He was the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt;. A minister, whom he expelled on the ground of misconduct in the royal harem, took service under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabbasena')"&gt;Dabbasena&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;, and incited him to make war on Ekarája. The latter was captured while sitting on the dais in the midst of his councillors and hanged head downwards by a cord from the lintel of a door. In this position Ekarája cultivated thoughts of loving-kindness towards his enemy and attained a stage of complete absorption in mystic meditation. His bonds burst and he sat cross-legged in mid air. Dabbasena was, meanwhile, seized with a burning pain in his body and, on the advice of his courtiers, had Ekarája released, whereupon the pains disappeared. Realising Ekarája's holiness, Dabbasena restored the kingdom to him and asked his forgiveness (J.iii.13-15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ekaraaja_jat_303')"&gt;Ekarája Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, reference is made to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasilava_jat_051')"&gt;Mahásílava Játaka&lt;/a&gt; for details regarding the expulsion of the minister for misconduct and of the subsequent events. But there the king is called Sílava and not Ekarája. The two stories contain certain similarities but the details vary very much. See also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/seyya_jat_282')"&gt;Seyya Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, where the king is called&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamsa, and compare it with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghata_jat_355_454')"&gt;Ghata Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. The Ekarája Játaka is given as an example of a birth in which the Bodhisatta practised mettá to perfection (E.g., BuA.51; Mbv.11). The story of </data>
<data>Ekarája is the last in the Cariyá-Pitaka (No. xiv).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Cariyá Pitaka Commentary (p.205), Ekarája was a title given to the king on account of his great power, in which case his real name might have been Sílava, as mentioned above. The scholiast on the Ekarája Játaka (J.iii.14), however, says that Ekarája was the king's personal name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekarája.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Pupphavatí (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;). He was the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vasavattii')"&gt;Vasavatti&lt;/a&gt; and the father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candakumaara')"&gt;Candakumára&lt;/a&gt;.

When in the deva-world, his term of life having come to an end, he was filled with anxiety as to where he should seek rebirth. A disciple of Padumuttara, named Sumana, seeing his plight, advised him to seek refuge in the Buddha. He followed the advice and escaped sorrow. Ap.i.194f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ekadhammasavaniya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ekadhammasavaniya Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-He was the son of a banker in Setavyá and he went to see the Buddha who was visiting the town and staying in the Simsapá-wood. The Buddha preached to him on the impermanence of all component things and at the end of the sermon he became an arahant. He received his name because he won insight by hearing the Dhamma only once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a tree-sprite and, coming across some monks who had lost their way, he looked after them, gave them food and directed them to their destination. After the death of Kassapa Buddha, he was born as the son of Suyáma and great-grandson of Kikí and became king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; under the name of Kikí Brahmadatta. Not finding anyone capable of preaching the Doctrine to him, he left his throne in disgust and started on his way to Himavá. As he went along the road, Sakka appeared before him and quoted to him some lines on the impermanence of all things. Satisfied therewith, the king returned to his capital (Thag.v.67; ThagA.i.151f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána verses regarding this Thera quoted in the Theragáthá Commentary are, in the Apadána itself (i.152f), attributed to an Elder named Maggasaññaka, with whom he is evidently to be identified. Five kappas ago he became king twelve times under the name of Sacakkhu. v.l. Ekadhammika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekadhammasavaniya Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant. In the time of Padumuttara he was a Jatila of great power. Once when journeying through the air he found his progress suddenly stopped and, on investigation, discovered that below him, on the ground, the Buddha was preaching. He listened to the sermon, which dealt with impermanence, and, returning to his hermitage, </data>
<data>meditated on this topic. Later he was born in Távatimsa. Fifty-one times he reigned as king of heaven for thirty thousand kappas and twenty-one times he was king of men. In this last life he heard a monk in his father's house preaching a sermon in reference to the impermanence of all component things. At the end of the sermon he remembered his former attainments and, seated there, reached arahantship. He was only seven years old at the time. Ap.ii.385.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Upatissa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Upatissa.-The personal name of Sáriputta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Upatissa.-Purohita to Vijaya, king of Ceylon. He founded a settlement at Upatissagáma. Mhv.vii.44; Dpv.ix.32, 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Upatissa I.-King of Ceylon. He reigned for forty-two years between A.C. 362 and 409. He was the eldest son of Buddhadása. He was of very kindly disposition and lived a simple life, eating of the food served in the Mahápáli alms-hall. It is said that once, when the roof of his palace started leaking at night, he lay all night in the wet, being loth to disturb any of the servants. During a period of drought and famine, he organised a religious festival, causing rain to fall. He built the Rajuppala, Gijjhakúta, Pokkharapásaya, Valáhassa, Ambutthi and Gondigáma tanks and the Khandarája Vihára, besides hospitals and almshouses for women in travail, the blind and the sick. He was murdered by his queen-consort, who had an intrigue with his younger brother, Mahánáma. For an account of Upatissa's reign see Cv.i.37, 179ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Upatissa II.-King of Ceylon. He was the husband of the sister of Moggallána I. and was his general. He killed Síva I, and became king, his reign lasting only one year and a half (A.C. 522-24). He had a son Kassapa, called Girikassapa by virtue of his prowess, and a daughter who married Silákála. Silákála became a rebel and seized Upatissa's kingdom. (For an account of Upatissa see Cv.xli.5f). Upatissa belonged to the Lambakanna clan, and in Sinhalese writing is called Lámáni-upatissa (Cv.Trs.i.52, n.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Upatissa.-Son of Silákála and brother of Dáthápabhuti and Moggallána II. He was a good-looking young man and was his </data>
<data>father's favourite. He was killed by Dáthápabhuti (Cv.xli.33ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Upatissa Thera.-Called Pásánadípavásí Upatissa. He appears to have written a Commentary on the Mahávamsa, which the author of the Mahávamsa Tíká used for his own work, sometimes criticising its comments. See, e.g., MT.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Upatissa.-Thera of Tambapapidípa (Ceylon), perhaps to be identified with No. 6 above. He and his colleague, Phussadeva, are often mentioned as being expert exponents of the Vinaya. Upatissa had two pupils, Mahápaduma and Mahásumma, who became very famous as vinayadhará. Mahápaduma &quot;read&quot; through the Vinaya eighteen times with his teacher, and Mahásumma nine times (Sp.i.263f). Buddhaghosa evidently regarded with great respect the explanations of various Vinaya questions as given by Upatissa, for he often quotes him. See, e.g., Sp.ii.456; iii.624, 714; iv.890.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Upatissa.-Sáriputta's father and chieftain of Nálaka or Upatissagáma (q.v.). His proper name was Vanganta (q.v.), Upatissa being, evidently, his clan name (SnA.i.326).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Upatissa Thera.-Author of the Páli Mahábodhi-vamsa. He lived in Ceylon, probably in the tenth century. For details see P.L.C. 156ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Upatissa Thera.-He wrote a commentary on Kassapa's Anágatavamsa. Gv.p.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. Upatissa.-A Pacceka Buddha, found in a nominal list (M.iii.69). The name is also found in the Apadána (i.280; ii.454).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12. Upatissa Thera.-Sometimes called Arahá Upatissa, author of the Vimuttimagga (P.L.C. 86). He probably lived about the first century B.C. J.P.T.S. 1919, pp.69ff; see also NidA. (P.T.S.); introd. vi f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;13. Upatissa Thera.-Author of the Saddhammappajjotiká, the commentary on the Mahá Niddesa, written at the request of Deva Thera (NidA.ii.108). His residence was on the western side of the Mahá Cetiya within the precincts of the Mahávihára in Anurádhapura, and it was built by a minister, Kittissena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some MSS. give the author's name as Upasena. For his age, see Saddhammappajjotiká.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was the sight of this novice which made Ráhula, then born as the Nága-king Sankha, wish to become a Buddha's son (SnA.i.340; MA.ii.722). According to the Buddhavamsa (xi.21), however, Padumuttara's son was called Uttara. Uparevata, though very young in years (tarunalalitadáraka), was possessed of great iddhi-powers and the Nága-king was greatly impressed by him (AA.i.142f. Here the nága king is called Pathayindhara).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uparevata.-Nephew of Sáriputta. When Sáriputta went to Nálaka on his last visit, in order to die there, Uparevata saw him outside the village, seated under a banyan tree. He was asked to announce Sáriputta's arrival to the latter's mother, and to make preparations for accommodating Sáriputta's five hundred followers (DA.ii.551; SA.iii.175).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Uppalavanná &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Uppalavanná Therí.-One of the two chief women disciples of the Buddha. She was born in Sávatthi as the daughter of a banker, and she received the name of Uppalavanná because her skin was the colour of the heart of the blue lotus. When she was come of age, kings and commoners from the whole of India sent messengers to her father, asking for her hand. He, not wishing to offend any of them, suggested that Uppalavanná should leave the world. Because of her upanissaya, she very willingly agreed and was ordained a nun. Soon it came to her turn to perform certain services in the uposatha-hall. Lighting the lamp, she swept the room. Taking the flame of the lamp as her visible object, she developed tejokasina and, attaining to jhána, became an arahant possessed of the four special attainments (patisambhidá). She became particularly versed in the mystic potency of transformation (iddhivikubbana). When the Buddha arrived at the Gandamba-tree to perform the Twin Miracle, Uppalavanná offered to perform certain miracles herself, if the Buddha would give his consent, but this he refused (ThigA.190, 195). Later, at Jetavana, in the assembly of the Sangha, he declared her to be the chief of the women possessed of iddhi-power (A.i.25). The Therígáthá (vv.234-5) contains several verses attributed to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of them had been uttered in anguish by a mother who had been unwittingly living as her daughter's rival with the man who later became the monk Gangátíriya (q.v.). Uppalavanná repeated them to help her to reflect on the harm and vileness of sensual desires. Two others are utterances of joy on the distinctions she had won and another records a miracle she performed before the Buddha, with his consent. The rest contain a conversation between Uppalavanná and Mára (a conversation, more or less </data>
<data>identical with the foregoing, is recorded in S.i.131f), wherein she tells him that she has passed completely beyond his power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books give several episodes connected with Uppalavanná. Once a young man named Ananda, who was her cousin and had been in love with her during her lay-life, hid himself in her hut in Andhavana and, in spite of her protestations, deprived her of her chastity. It is said that he was swallowed up by the fires of Avící. From that time onwards, nuns were forbidden to live in Andhavana (DhA.ii.49f; the incident is referred to in Vin.iii.35). It is said (E.g., DhA.iv.166f) that this incident gave rise to the question whether even arahants enjoyed the pleasures of love and wished to gratify their passions. Why should they not? For they are not trees nor ant-hills, but living creatures with moist flesh. The Buddha most emphatically declared that thoughts of lust never entered the hearts of the saints. On another occasion, Uppalavanná came across, in Andhavana, some meat left behind, obviously for her, by some kind-hearted thief; having cooked the meat, she took it to the Buddha at Veluvana. Finding him away on his alms-rounds, she left the meat with Udáyi, who was looking after the vihára, to be given to the Buddha, but Udáyi insisted on Uppalavanná giving him her inner robe as a reward for his services (Vin.iii.208f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.211), the miracle which Uppalavanná volunteered to perform at the Gandamba-tree, was the assumption of the form of a cakkavatti, with a retinue extending for thirty-six leagues and the paying of homage to the Buddha, with all the cakkavatti's followers, in the presence of the multitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made of a pupil of Uppalavanná, who followed the Buddha for seven years, learning the Vinaya (Vin.ii.261).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The Buddha declares that Khemá and Uppalavanná are the measure of his women disciples, and that the believing nun, if she would aspire perfectly, should aspire to be like them (A.i.88; ii.164; S.ii.236).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Padumuttara's time Uppalavanná saw a woman disciple who was declared to be the best of those possessed of supernormal power, and wished for herself a similar rank in the dispensation of a future Buddha. In the time of Kassapa, she was one of the seven daughters of Kikí, king of Benares, and having done many good deeds, was born in heaven. Later, she was born in the world of men and had to work for her own living. One day she gave to a Pacceka Buddha, who had just risen from samádhi, a meal of fried rice in his bowl and covered it with a beautiful lotus; the meal had been prepared for herself. The lotus she afterwards took back but again replaced it, asking the Pacceka Buddha's forgiveness. She expressed a wish that she should beget as many sons as there were grains of rice in her gift, and that lotuses should spring up under her feet as she walked. In her next birth she was born in a lotus. An ascetic adopted her as his daughter, but when she grew up, the king of Benares, hearing of her beauty, asked the ascetic for her hand and made her his chief queen, under the name of Padumavatí. The king's other wives were jealous of her beauty, and when the king was away, quelling a rising of the border tribes, they concealed in caskets the five hundred sons, chief of whom was the prince Mahápaduma (q.v.), that were born to Padumavatí, and told the king that Padumavatí was a non-human and had given birth to a log of wood. Padumavatí was sent away in disgrace, but later, through the instrumentality of Sakka, the trick was exposed, and Padumavatí regained all her former power and glory. (Her temporary downfall was due to her having withdrawn her gift of a lotus to the </data>
<data>Pacceka Buddha.) Later, when Mahápaduma and his brothers became Pacceka Buddhas, Padumavatí died of a broken heart and was born in a village outside Rájagaha. There some of the Pacceka Buddhas who had been her sons discovered her, and they all came to a meal at her house. At the conclusion of the meal she offered them blue lotuses, and expressed the wish that her complexion should be like the matrix of the blue lotus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This account is a summary of the Therígáthá Commentary, pp.182ff; AA.i.188ff; but see also DhA.ii.48f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána account of the past lives of Uppakavanna differs from the above in several details (ii.551. But vv.1-15 quoted in the ThigA. differ from those in the Apadána, and agree with the ThigA. account). According to this account, in Padumuttara's time she was a Nága maiden named Vimalá and was impressed by the iddhi-powers displayed by a nun, hence her wish for similar powers. The Apadána also mentions Uppalavanná's birth as the daughter of a banker of Benares, in the time of Vipassí. She gave great alms to the Buddha and the monks and made offerings of lotuses. She was the second daughter of Kikí and her name was Samannaguttá. In her next birth she became the ravishing daughter of Tirítavaccha of Aritthapura. In her last birth she became an arahant within a fortnight of her ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uppalavanná's name occurs several times in the Játakas. In the Kharádiya Játaka (J.i.160) she was a deer, the sister of the Bodhisatta; in the Tipallatthamiga Játaka (J.i.164) she was the mother of Ráhula, then born as a stag. She is identified with the old woman, the foster-mother of Ayyakálaka (J.i.196), with the queen Mudulakkhaná (J.i.306), the brahminee in the Sárambha (J.i.375), the courtesan in the Kurudhamma (J.ii.381), the brahmin's daughter (and sister of Ráhula) in the Dhonasákha </data>

It was at the time of the quarrel of the Kosambí monks; the Buddha, in search of quietness, goes to Bálakalonaka, preaches there to Bhagu and proceeds to Pácínavamsadáya, where he tells his cousins how they should develop meditation, getting rid of all obstacles. M.iii.152ff. The verses of the sutta are also found in the Vinaya version (i.349ff). Some of the verses are included in the Dhammapada (vv.328-30) and in the Khaggavisána Butts of the Sutta Nipáta (vv.11, 12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Gold ore must be purified from all its dross before it can be used for making ornaments, etc.; similarly, the mind must be freed from its impurities - the five nívaranas - before it can be used for acquiring the higher knowledge (A.iii.16-19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Four things prevent the sun and the moon from shining with their full brilliance - clouds, mist, smoke and dust and Ráhu. Similarly four things diminish the holiness of ascetics and recluses - intoxicants, sex, money and wrong livelihood (A.ii.53f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, when going to bathe with his pupils, he saw the Buddha and gave him his upper garment (uttaríya). The garment remained in the sky, forming a canopy over the Buddha and his monks. As a result, for thirty thousand kappas, Uttareyyadáyaka was born in the deva-worlds, and fifty times he became king of the gods. On thirty-six occasions he was king of men. Everywhere he went a canopy of fine material appeared over him and he obtained all he wished for. Ap.i.272-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was the birthplace of Sáriputta (ThagA.ii.93; DhA.i.73). Its real name was Nálaka (q.v.), but it was called Upatissagáma, evidently because its chieftains belonged to the Upatissa clan. It is probable that Sáriputta's father, who was head of the village (gámasámi), was also called Upatissa. See SnA.i.326.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Upatissagáma (sometimes called Upatissanagara).-The settlement founded by Vijaya's chaplain, Upatissa, on the banks of the Gambhíra-nadí, about seven miles to the north of Anurádhapura (Mhv.vii.44; Mhv.Trs.58, n.4; Dpv.ix.36; x.5). It was the seat of government till Anurádhapura became the capital (See, e.g., Mhv.viii.4; x.48). Soon after Mahinda's arrival in Ceylon many young men joined the Order, and among them there were five hundred from Upatissagáma (Mhv.xvii.60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In a previous life, when Anuruddha was born as Annabhára, he offered alms to the Pacceka Buddha and made various wishes which were fulfilled in later births (DhA.i.113f). Uparittha had spent seven days in meditation on Gandhamádana, and when he appeared before Annabhára, the latter ran home to his wife, fetched the food which had been prepared for themselves and gave it to Uparittha. Uparittha ate the meal seated on Annabhára's garment, which was spread on the ground for him. AA.i.105; Thag.910; ThagA.ii.66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Having nothing else to give, she regularly provided water in a bath for others. As a result, she was born in heaven and was fifty times queen of the deva-king and twenty times queen of kings on earth. She could produce rain at will, and her body knew neither heat nor dirt.

Once when the Buddha was staying there, Bhadragaka, the headman of the town, visited him, and the Buddha preached to him a sermon on the arising and the cessation of Ill (S.iv.327f). It was perhaps on the same occasion that the Buddha was visited by the headman Rásiya, and he seems to have talked to him on various topics connected with the doctrine (S.iv.330ff). Record is also made of a sermon preached by the Buddha at Uruvelakappa and addressed to the monks regarding the importance of insight (ariyañána) (S.iv.228f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when the Buddha was staying at Uruvelakappa, he informed Ananda that he wished to spend the day alone in the Mahávana, and he went there and sat down at the foot of a tree. Meanwhile the householder Tapassu arrived and told Ananda that be could not understand how young men in the prime of life found any attraction in renouncing the world. Ananda took Tapassu to the Buddha, who set his doubts at rest. (A.iv.438ff)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Uddaka taught him the doctrine which had been realised and proclaimed by his father Ráma, which was the attainment of the state of &quot;neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness&quot; (corresponding to the fourth Jhána). When Gotama had mastered this, Uddaka made him more than his own equal by setting him over the whole company of his disciples as their teacher. But Gotama, finding this doctrine unsatisfactory, abandoned it (M.i.165ff., 240ff.; DhA.i.70-1). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha evidently had a high regard for Uddaka-Rámaputta, for after the Enlightenment, when looking for someone to whom the Dhamma might be preached, and who was capable of realising its import at once, his thoughts turned to Uddaka, but Uddaka was already dead (Vin.i.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Vassakára Sutta of the Anguttara Nikáya (ii.180) it is mentioned that King Eleyya, together with his bodyguard, Yamaka, Moggalla and others, were followers of Rámaputta and that they held him in great esteem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikáya (iv.83f) the Buddha says that Uddaka claimed to be &quot;versed in lore and to have conquered everything, digging out the root of Ill,&quot; though he had no justification for such a claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, in the Pásádika Sutta (D.iii.126-7), the Buddha tells Cunda that when Uddaka said &quot;seeing, he seeth not,&quot; he had in mind a man who saw the blade of a sharpened razor but not its edge - a low, pagan thing to speak about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sanskrit books Uddaka-Rámaputta is called Udraka.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Uttarápatha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The northern division of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')"&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/a&gt;. Its boundaries are nowhere explicitly stated in Páli literature. It has been suggested (See Law, Early Geog. of Bsm., pp.48ff) that Uttarápatha was originally the name of a great trade-route, the northern high road which extended from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhaara')"&gt;Gandhára&lt;/a&gt;, and that it lent its name - as did the Dakkhinápatha - to the region through which it passed. If this be so, the name would include practically the whole of Northern India, from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga')"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt; in the east to Gandhára in the north-west, and from the Himálaya in the north to the Vindhyá in the south. According to the brahmanical tradition, as recorded in the Kávyamímámsá (p.93), the Uttarápatha is to the west of Prithudaka (Pehoa, about fourteen miles west of Tháneswar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief divisions included in this territory are mentioned in the Páli literature as Kasmíra-Gandhára and Kamboja. This region was famous from very early times for its horses and horse-dealers (See, e.g., Vin.iii.6; Sp.i.175), and horses were brought down for sale from there to such cities as Benares (J.ii.287).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Uttarápatha was Kamsabhoga, where, in the city of Asitañjana, King Mahákamsa reigned (J.iv.79). The Divyávadana (p.470) mentions another city, Utpalavatí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahávastu (iii.303), Ukkala, the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tapassu')"&gt;Tapassu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhallika')"&gt;Bhalluka&lt;/a&gt;, was in Uttarápatha, as well as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt;, the famous university (Mtu.ii.166).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;There was regular trade between Sávatthi and Uttarápatha (PvA.100). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anganika_bh')"&gt;Anganika Bháradvája&lt;/a&gt; had friends in Uttarápatha (ThagA.i.339).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day the Buddha came to his house and he filled the Buddha's bowl with the food prepared for his own use. Three days in succession the Buddha came, and Udaya, feeling annoyed, said to the Buddha: &quot;A pertinacious and greedy man is the Samana Gotama that he comes again and again.&quot; The Buddha pointed out to him how, again and again, the furrow has to be sown to ensure a continuous supply of food, how over and over again the dairy-folk draw milk, and how again and again birth and death come to the slow-witted. At the end of the sermon both Udaya and his household became followers of the Buddha. S.i.173f; SA.i.199-200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Because Udaya had already attained to the fourth &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/jhaana')"&gt;jhána&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha gave his explanation in the terms of jhána. At the end of the sermon Udaya realised the Truth. Sn.1006, 1105-11; SnA.ii.599-600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Udaya (or Udayana).&lt;/b&gt;-A prince of Hamsavati.

Bu.xviii.21; J.i.40; BuA.189.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta born as king of Benares. In his previous birth he had been a servant of Suciparivára (q.v.). On fast days it was the custom in Suciparivára's house for everyone, even down to </data>
<data>the cowherds, to observe the uposatha, but this servant, being new to the place, was not aware of this. He went to work early in the morning and returned late in the evening. When he discovered that all the others were keeping the fast he refused to touch any food and, as a result, died the same night. Just before death he saw the king of Benares passing in procession with great splendour, and felt a desire for royalty. He was therefore born as the son of the king of Benares and was named Udaya. In due course he became king, and one day, having seen Addhamásaka (q.v.) and learnt his story, he gave him half his kingdom. Later, when Addhamásaka confessed to him the evil idea that had passed through his mind of killing the king in order to gain the whole kingdom, Udaya, realising the wickedness of desire, renounced the kingdom and became an ascetic in the Himálaya. When leaving the throne he uttered a stanza containing a riddle which was ultimately solved by Gangamála (q.v.). J.iii.444ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Udaya&lt;/b&gt;.-King of Ceylon, Udaya I. (A.C. 792-797), also called Dappula. He was the son of Mahinda II. and his wife was the clever Sená. He had several children, among them Devá, who was given in marriage to Mahinda, son of the Ádipáda Dáthásiva of Rohana. For details of his reign see Cv.xlix.1ff; also Cv. Trs.i.126, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-A brother of Sena I. and his Ádipáda. During the king's absence from the capital, he married Nálá, daughter of his maternal uncle, and took her to Pulatthinagara, but the king forgave him and later, when his elder brother Mahinda died, made him Mahádipáda, sending him as ruler of the Southern Province. Soon after, however, Udaya fell ill and died (Cv.l.6, 8, 44, 45). According to an inscription, he had a son who, under Kassapa IV., became Mahálekhaka. See Cv. Trs.i.138, n.3 and 142, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

He succeeded Sena II. and reigned eleven years. During his reign the province of Rohana was brought once more under the rule of the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Ceylon, Udaya III. (A.C. 934-937). He was the son of Mahinda, a younger brother of Sena II., and his mother was Kittí or Kittá. He was first yuvarája of Dappula IV. and later succeeded him as king. Cv.liii.4, 13ff; Cv.Trs.i.172, n.5 and 174, n.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Udaya.-&lt;/b&gt;King of Ceylon, Udaya IV. (A.C. 945-953). He was a friend of Sena III. (perhaps his younger brother, see Ep. Zey.ii.59) and was his yuvarája. On Sena's death, Udaya succeeded him and reigned for eight years. During his reign the Colas invaded Ceylon, but were repulsed (Cv.liii.28, 39ff; also Cv.Trs.i.177, n.2). Among his religious activities was the erection of the Manipásáda, which, however, he could not complete. Cv.liv.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Younger brother and yuvarája of Sena V. In Sena's quarrel with his mother, Udaya took the side of the latter. Cv.liv.58, 63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Udaya&lt;/b&gt;.-Senápati of Sena V. He was appointed by the king while the real Senápati was away in the border country. When the latter heard of the appointment, he marched against the king and defeated his forces. Sena was forced to come to terms with the Senápati and banish Udaya from the country.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Uttaradesa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A province of Ceylon, probably to the north of Anurádhapura. It was often occupied by the Tamils, and its chiefs refused to acknowledge allegiance to the Sinhalese kings. Its people had to be subdued from time to time by the Sinhalese kings, in order to establish the peace of the land and the security of the throne (See, e.g., Cv.xliv.71; xlvii.3, 54; xlviii.83-4, 95, 112).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district formed a convenient landing-place for invaders coming to Ceylon from India, where they might complete their preparations (E.g., Cv.i.14).

He was so called (&quot;Welcome&quot;) because he was born to his parents as a result of their prayers. He had a step-sister, Udayabhaddá. When his parents wished him to marry, he refused, but in the end, yielding to their entreaties, he made a woman's image in gold and desired them to find a wife who resembled it. Udayabhaddá alone could rival the image, so she was wedded to Udayabhadda. They lived together in chastity and, in due course, when Udayabhadda died, the princess became queen. The king was born as Sakka, and honouring a promise he had made to the princess to return and announce to her the place of his birth, he visited her as soon as he remembered her, and, before revealing himself, tested her in various ways. Being satisfied with her conduct, he instructed her and went away. The princess, renouncing the kingdom, became a recluse. Later she was born in Távatimsa as the Bodhisatta's handmaiden.

The citizens gave a special kathina-robe to his chief disciple, Sála (BuA.148). According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.173), Piyadassí Buddha preached his first sermon in the same pleasaunce, but the Buddhavamsa (xiv.119) gives its name as Ussávana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Upasena &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Upasena Thera.-Maternal uncle of Vijitasena Thera and brother of Sena. He was an elephant-trainer, and having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and, in due course, became an arahant. He ordained Vijitasena (ThagA.i.424). According to the Mahávastu (iii.60ff), Sáriputta was converted to Buddhism not by Assaji, as recorded in the Pitakas, but by an Elder named Upasena, who is, perhaps, to be identified with the Upasena. The Mahávastu (iii.431f) also mentions an Upasena who was nephew to the Tebhátika Jatilas. When the Tebhátikas accepted the Buddha as their teacher, they cast the garments, etc., which they had used as ascetics, into the Nerañjará, on the banks of which was Upasena's hermitage. When Upasena saw the robes, etc., he knew that something must have happened to his uncles. He went at once to see them and, having heard the good tidings of their new-found bliss became a monk himself. It is not stated whether this Upasena is identical with the Elder of the same name mentioned above as the teacher of Sáriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Upasena Vangantaputta.-He was born in. Nálaka as the son of Rúpasárí, the brahminee, his father being Vanganta. He was the younger brother of Sáriputta (UdA.266; DhA.ii.188). When he came of age, he learnt the three Vedas, and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order. When his ordination was but one year old, he ordained another bhikkhu, to increase the number of holy ones, and went with him to wait upon the Buddha. The Buddha roundly rebuked him for this hasty procedure (Vin.i.59; Sp.i.194; J.ii.449), and Upasena, wishing to earn the Master's praise on account of the very cause of this rebuke, practised insight and became an arahant. Thereafter he adopted various dhutangas and persuaded others to do likewise. In a short </data>
<data>time he had a large retinue, each member of which was charming in his way, and the Buddha declared Upasena to be the best of those who were altogether charming (samantapásádikánam) (A.i.24). Buddhaghosa says that Upasena was famed as a very clever preacher (pathavighutthadhammakathika), and many joined him because of his eloquence. AA.i.152; also Mil.360, where more details are given of how Upasena admitted monks into the Order and of the conditions imposed on them; for a slightly different version see Vin.iii.230ff; it is said there that after Upasena's visit, the Buddha allowed monks who practised dhutangas, to visit him even during his periods of retreat. See also Sp.iii.685f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He visited the Buddha when the Buddha had enjoined on himself a period of solitude for a fortnight; the monks had agreed that anyone who went to see the Buddha would be guilty of a pácittiya offence, but the Buddha, desiring to talk to him, asked one of Upasena's followers if he liked rag-robes. &quot;No, Sir, but I wear them out of regard for my teacher,&quot; was the reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Theragáthá are found several verses ascribed to Upasena as having been spoken by him in answer to a question by his saddhivihdrika, regarding what was to be done during the dissensions of the Kosambí monks (vv. 577-86; the first verse is quoted in the Milinda 371 and also the fifth 395). The Milinda-pañha (pp.393, 394) contains several other verses attributed to Upasena similar in their trend of ideas and admonitions. The Udána states (p.45f; UdA.266ff) that once when he was taking his siesta he reviewed the happiness he enjoyed and the glories of the life he led under the guidance of the Buddha. The Buddha, noticing this, proclaimed his approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, while Upasena was sitting after his meal in the shadow of the Sappasondika-pabbhára, fanned by the gentle </data>
<data>breeze, mending his outer robe, two young snakes were sporting in the tendrils overhanging the cave. One fell on his shoulder and bit him, and the venom spread rapidly throughout his body; he called to Sáriputta and other monks who were near, and requested that he might be taken outside on a couch, there to die. This was done, and his body &quot;was scattered there and then like a handful of chaff.&quot; (S.iv.40f; SA.iii.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upasena had been, in Padumuttara's day, a householder of Hamsavatí. One day he heard the Buddha declare one of his monks to be the best of those who were altogether charming, and wished for a similar declaration regarding himself by some future Buddha. Towards this end he did many deeds of piety (ThagA.i.525). The Apadána mentions that he gave a meal to Padumuttara and eight monks, and at the meal placed over the Buddha's head a parasol made of kanikdra-flowers. As a result, he was thirty times king of the devas and twenty-one times cakkavatti. (Ap.i.62). The verses quoted from the Apadána in the ThagA. are slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upasena is given, together with Yasa Kákandakaputta, as an example of one who observed the Vinaya precepts thoroughly, without imposing any new rules or agreements. DA.ii.525.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Vaka Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Upasena Thera.-Mentioned in the Gandhavamsa (61, 66; also Svd.1197) as the author of the Saddhammappajjotiká, the commentary on the Mahá Niddesa. But see Upatissa (13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Upasena.-Son of Sujáta Buddha. Bu.xiii.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once when the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was staying at the Deer Park in Kannakatthala in the neighbourhood of the city, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;, who happened to be at Ujuññá on business, visited the Buddha. On this occasion was preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kannakatthala_s')"&gt;Kannakatthala Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.125ff; MA.ii.757).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was here too that Nigantha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/acela_kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; came to see the Buddha. This visit is recorded in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapasiihanaada_s')"&gt;Kassapa Síhanáda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. D.i.161ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Uggata.-A khattiya of the city of Sumangala, father of Sujáta Buddha. J.i.38; Bu.xiii.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Uggata.-The Kálinga king who, with Bhímaratha, king of Sañjayantí, and Atthaka, king of Hastinápura, sought the Bodhisatta Sarabhanga to learn from him where the kings Kalábu, Nálikira, Ajjuna and Dandakí had been born after the destruction of themselves and their kingdoms as a result of their ill-treatment of holy men. J.v.135ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their story is given in the Sarabhanga Játaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholiast of the Játaka (J.v.137) takes Uggata to be not the name of the Kálinga king but a descriptive epithet, and explains it by saying cando viya suriyo viya ca pákato paññáto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávastu (iii.364f), however, definitely mentions Ugga as the name of the king, in the same way as Bhímaratha and Asthamaka (Atthaka), and gives the capitals of the two latter as Sañjayantí and Hastinápura respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Uggata.-King during the time of Sobhita Buddha. He built a vihára named Surinda at Sunandavatí and another named Dhammaganáráma at Mekhalá and dedicated them to the Buddha and the Order. At the festival of dedication of the former one hundred crores became arahants and at that of the latter, ninety crores (Bu.vii.9f; BuA.139).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Uggata.-Twenty-nine kappas ago there were sixteen kings of the name of Uggata, all previous incarnations of the Thera Citakapújaka. Ap.i.151.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Uggata.-King of one thousand and fifty-one kappas ago; a previous life of Dhajadáyaka Thera. Ap.i.109.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;7. Uggata.-Fourteen kappas ago there were four kings named Uggata, previous births of Parappasádaka (Ap.i.114) or Bhúta (ThagA.i.494) Thera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was a favourite spot of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pindola')"&gt;Pindola-Bháradvája&lt;/a&gt;, who often spent the day there. On one occasion when he was there, Udena came with the women of the palace to the pleasaunce to enjoy himself. When the king fell asleep the women wandered about the park and, seeing Pindola, they went up to him and he preached to them. The king, on waking, was enraged to find the women absent and, on learning the cause, went to Pindola and questioned him. Pindola, knowing that the king had no wish to learn, sat silent. The king, in great anger, threatened to cast a net of red ants on the Elder, but before he could carry out his threat, Pindola vanished through the air (SnA.ii.514f; SA.iii.27f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Udakapújaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. In a previous birth he saw Padumuttara Buddha journeying through the air and wished to offer him some water. He, therefore, threw some water into the air, which the Buddha, out of compassion, stopped to receive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-five kappas ago Udakapújaka became king three times under the name of Sahassarája (Ap.i.142-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Kutiviháriya Thera.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Uttara-Vihára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another name for the Abhayagiri-Vihára (q.v.). The inhabitants of the Uttaravihára seem to have kept a chronicle, in the same way as did the dwellers of the Mahá-Vihára. This is often referred to in the Mahávamsa Tíká, as the Uttara-Vihára-atthakathá and the Uttara-Vihára-Mahávamsa. Judging from the quotations from this work given in the Mahávamsa Tíká, the Uttara-Vihára chronicle seems to have differed from the tradition of the Mahá-Vihára more in detail than in general construction. It is not possible to say whether it contained exegetical matter on the Páli Canon besides matters of historical interest. For a detailed account of the work see Geiger: The Dípavamsa and the Mahávamsa, pp.50ff; also my edition of the Mahávamsa Tíká.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Uppalavanna&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The god to whom Sakka entrusted the guardianship of Lanká and its people. He met Vijaya and his followers when they landed in Ceylon and sprinkled water on them and wound a sacred thread about their hands for protection (Mhv.vii.5). The god is generally identified with Visnu, though there is evidence to show that, at least in later mythology, the two gods were distinct. Somewhere about A.D. 790, a shrine was erected to Uppalavanna in Devanagara (modern Dondra) in South Ceylon. This shrine was later plundered by the Portuguese. King Vírabáhu offered there a sacrifice of victory (Cv.lxxxiii.49; see also Cv.Trs.ii.152, n.3) and Parakkamabáhu II. rebuilt the shrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ninety-four kappas ago he had seen the Pacceka Buddha Kosika, in Himavá, engaged in meditation, and for seven days he had one hundred torches kept lighted near the Buddha. On the eighth day he gave alms to the Pacceka Buddha. As a result he was born in Tusita, and from his body rays of light issued, spreading one hundred leagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five kappas ago he reigned as king of Jambudípa, with his capital in Sobhana, built by Vissakamma himself, entirely of gold.

The story was related in connection with a backsliding brother who, having seen a very beautiful woman as he was going his alms-rounds in Sávatthi, gave himself up to despair and had to be led to the Buddha for admonition (J.v.209ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is also found, with certain slight variations, in the Játakamálá under the title of Ummádayantí Játaka (No.xiii).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tale of a maiden who made all who saw her mad, and of the love-smitten monarch who preferred walking in the right path and even meeting death itself to indulging in passion, is found also in the Kathásaritságara.

The Nága king, Campeyya, was brought before him by a brahmin snake-charmer for a performance, but when the king learnt from the Naga's sister, Sumaná, what had happened, he caused the Nága to be set free. Later, Campeyya took him to the Nága-world and shewed him every honour. Uggasena's subjects were allowed to bring back from the Nága-world whatever they desired (J.v.458ff; Mtu.ii.177ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is told in the Campeyya Játaka (q.v.). In the present age Uggasena became Sáriputta. J.v.468.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uggasena.-Son of a banker of Rájagaha. He fell in love with a very skilful acrobat, married her and followed her about with her troupe. When he discovered that she despised him for his lack of skill as an acrobat, he learnt the art and became a clever tumbler. The Buddha knew that Uggasena was ready for conversion and entering Rájagaha while Uggasena was displaying his skill before a large crowd of people, withdrew their attention from his skilful feats. Seeing Uggasena's disappointment, the Buddha sent Moggallána to ask him to continue his performance, and while Uggasena was displaying his skill by various tricks, the Buddha preached to him, and Uggasena became an arahant, even as he stood poised on the tip of a pole, and later became a monk. His wife also left the world soon after and attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha they were husband and wife. On their way to the shrine of the Buddha where they worked as labourers, they saw an Elder and gave him part of the food they had with them and expressed the desire that they should, one day, like him, realise the Truth. The Elder, looking into the future, saw that their wish would be fulfilled and smiled. The wife, seeing him smile, said to her husband that the Elder must be </data>
<data>an actor, and the husband agreed. Because of this remark they became actors in this life, but through their pious gift they attained arahantship. DhA.iv.59-65; also ibid., 159.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Uggasena.-King, husband of Queen Dinná (q.v.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-A banker in the time of Konágamana Buddha; he was one of the Buddha's chief lay-supporters and built for him a residence, half a league in extent, on the site of the later Jetavana. J.i.94; Bu.xxiv.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-The chief minister of Pasenadi, king of Kosala (AA.ii.697). He once visited the Buddha and told him how he rivalled in power and wealth the setthi Migára, grandson of Rohana. He was worth one hundred thousand in gold alone, to say nothing of silver. The Buddha tells him that all this wealth could easily be lost in various ways, not so the seven kinds of Ariyan wealth (saddhá, síla, etc.). A.iv.6-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-One of those that formed the retinue of the rájá Eleyya. He was a follower of Uddaka-Rámaputta, whom the king too held in veneration. A.ii.180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;. Ugga (-Gahapati).-&lt;/b&gt;A householder of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthigama')"&gt;Hatthigáma(ka)&lt;/a&gt; of the Vajji country. Among householders he was declared by the Buddha to be the best of those who waited on the Order (sanghupatthákánam) (A.i.26). On his father's death he was appointed to the post of setthi. Once when the Buddha went to Hatthigáma during a tour and was staying in the Nágavanuyyána there, Ugga came to the pleasance, with dancers, at the conclusion of a drinking-feast of seven days' duration. At the sight of the Buddha he was seized with great shame and his intoxication vanished. The Buddha preached to him and he became an anágámí. Thereupon he dismissed his dancers and devoted himself to looking after members of the Sangha. Devas visited him at night and told him of the attainments of various monks, suggesting that he should choose only the eminent </data>
<data>ones as the recipients of his gifts. But what he gave, he gave to all with equal delight (AA.i.214-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha once stated that Ugga was possessed of eight special and wonderful qualities. One of the monks, hearing the Buddha's statement, went to Ugga and asked him what these qualities were. Ugga replied that he was not aware of what the Buddha had in mind and proceeded to explain eight wonderful things that had happened to him, viz.:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) As soon as he saw the Buddha, his state of drunkenness vanished and he made obeisance to the Buddha, who talked to him on various topics, such as dána, síla, etc. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) When the Buddha saw that Ugga's mind was ready, he preached to him the Four Truths, which he understood and realised. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) He had had four young and beautiful wives; when he took the vow of celibacy, he made ample provision for them; for one of them he obtained the husband of her choice, because she so desired, and this he did with no tinge of jealousy. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) All his immense wealth he shared with men of good and lovely conduct. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(5) On whatever monk he waited, he did it with whole-heartedness; to the monk's preaching he listened earnestly; if the monk did not preach, Ugga himself taught him the doctrine. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(6) Devas told him of the different attainments of various monks, but he   gave to all alike, without distinction. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(7) He felt no pride that he should hold converse with devas. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(8) He did not worry about death because the Buddha had assured him that   he would never more return to this world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monk reports this conversation to the Buddha and the Buddha tells him that these were the very qualities he had in </data>
<data>mind when praising Ugga (A.iv.212-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya (Vajjí Sutta&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;S.iv.109f) records a visit paid to the Buddha by Ugga, at Hatthigámaka. He asked the Buddha why it was that some beings attained full freedom in this very life, while others did not. Because of grasping, says the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ugga had been a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He once heard the Buddha preach and declare, at the end of his sermon, one of his lay disciples to be the best of those who waited on the Order. He wished for himself a similar attainment and did many good deeds towards that end (AA.i.214). v.l. Uggata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-A householder of Vesáli, declared by the Buddha to be the best of those who gave agreeable gifts (manápadáyakánam). (A.i.26; in SA.iii.26 he is wrongly described as aggo panítadáyakánam - the title of Mahánáma).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His original name is not known. He came to be called Ugga-setthi, because he was tall in body, lofty in morals and of striking personality. The very first time he saw the Buddha, he became a sotápanna and later an anágámí. When he was old, the thought came to him one day, while he was alone, &quot;I will give to the Buddha whatever I consider most attractive to myself and I have heard from him that such a giver obtains his wishes. I wish the Buddha would come to my house now.&quot; The Buddha, reading his thoughts, appeared before his door with a following of monks. He received them with great respect and, having given them a meal, announced to the Buddha his intention of providing him and the monks with whatever they found agreeable (AA.i.213-4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While staying at the Kútágárasálá in Vesáli, the Buddha once declared to the monks that Ugga was possessed of eight marvellous qualities. The rest of the story is very similar to that of Ugga of </data>
<data>Hatthigámaka, given above. This Ugga states as the first wonderful thing which happened to him, the faith he found in the Buddha at their very first meeting; three and four are the same; the fifth is that whatever monk he waits on, he does it whole-heartedly; the sixth, that if the monk preaches he would listen with attention, if the monk does not preach, Ugga would teach to him the doctrine; the seventh is the same; the eighth that he has got rid of all the orambhágiya-samyojanas mentioned by the Buddha. The conversation is reported to the Buddha who agrees that Ugga does possess the qualities mentioned (A.iv.208-12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya (S.iv.109f) repeats under Ugga of Vesáli the same discussion with the Buddha as was given in connection with Ugga of Hatthigáma, regarding the reason why some beings do not attain complete freedom in this very life. This is perhaps due to uncertainty on the part of the compilers as to which Ugga took part in the original discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sutta in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.iii.49-51) gives a list of things of which Ugga himself was fond. We are told that he offered these things to the Buddha. The list includes rice-cakes made in the shape of Sála-blossoms, the flesh of sucking pig and Kási robes. These and other things were given not only to the Buddha, but, according to the Commentary (AA.ii.602), also to five hundred monks. The Sutta goes on to say that Ugga died soon after and was born among the Manomayadevá. He visited the Buddha from the deva-world and stated that he had achieved his goal (of reaching arahantship).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is included in a list of householders who possessed six special qualities: unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, Ariyan conduct, insight and liberation (A.iv.451).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His desire to become chief of those who </data>
<data>give agreeable things was first conceived in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he was a householder in Hamsavatí; he heard the Buddha describe one of his disciples as being a giver of such gifts (AA.i.213).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-A thera. He was the son of a banker in Ugga, in the Kosala country. When the Buddha was staying in the Bhaddáráma there, Ugga heard him preach and entered the Order. Soon afterwards he became an arahant (Thag.v.80; ThagA.i.174-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been a householder in the time of Sikhí Buddha and offered him a ketaka-flower. As a result, he was born twelve times as king. He is probably to be identified with Sudassana Thera of the Apadána (i.164-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Ugga. &lt;/b&gt;A banker of the city of Ugga; he was a friend of Anáthapindika and, according to some accounts, his son married Anáthapindika's daughter, Cúla Subhaddá. He and his family had been followers of the Niganthas, but they later became followers of the Buddha through the intervention of Subhaddá. For the story see Cúla Subhaddá. See also Kálaka (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-A township (nigama) in Koala. The Buddha stayed there at the Bhaddáráma (ThagA.i.74). The town was the residence of the banker Ugga, and was once a stronghold of the Niganthas; after the conversion of Ugga's family, through Cúla Subhaddá's intervention, the people became faithful followers of the Buddha and for some time Anuruddha lived there, at the Buddha's special bidding, to preach to the new converts (DhA.iii.465-9; according to ThagA.i.65 Mahá Subhaddá also lived in Ugga, in a family of unbelievers). Probably the Uggáráma, mentioned in the story of Anganika Bháradvája (ThagA.i.339; Brethren, 157, n.4), was also in Ugga, in which case it was near the village of Kundiya of the Kuru country.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Upavatta (Upavattana)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sála-grove of the Mallas of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa')"&gt;Kusinára&lt;/a&gt;, on the further side of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hirannavati')"&gt;Hiraññavatí&lt;/a&gt;. This was the last resting-place of the Buddha on his last tour, and here he passed away, lying on a bed placed between two sála trees (D.ii.137ff; Dpv.xv.70).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhadda')"&gt;Subhadda&lt;/a&gt; visited the Buddha in the earlier part of the last night of his life, was converted and gained admission into the Order, afterwards winning arahantship. (See also DhA.iii.377). It was here, too, that the Buddha asked the monks if they had any doubts they wished to hear solved regarding the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, magga and patipadá, or any questions they wished to ask (A.ii.79), and here he gave his last admonition to the monks (S.i.157; see also Ud.37f). Ananda tried to persuade him to die in a place of greater importance, and the Buddha, in order to disabuse his mind, preached to him the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasudassana_s')"&gt;Mahá Sudassana Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.169f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.572f) that the road to the sála-grove from the Hiraññavatí led from the further bank of the river, like the road from the Kadambanadí to the Thúpáráma in Anurádhapura which led through the Rájamátu-vihára. The row of sála-trees stretched from south to east and then continued to the north (&quot;like the chief street in Anurádhapura&quot;). Hence the name Upavattana. The grove was to the southwest of Kusinára. UdA.238.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She was born with the semblance of a necklet upon her neck and shoulders, as though drawn by a painter, hence her name, Uracchadá. When sixteen years old she heard Kassapa Buddha preach, and became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. That same day she attained arahantship, entered the Order and passed into Nibbána (J.vi.481).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí, both Uracchadá and Queen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahamaayaa')"&gt;Máyá&lt;/a&gt; (mother of Gotama Buddha) were born as the daughters of King Bandhumá. One day the king received a present of a golden wreath, worth a thousand, and a box of precious sandalwood. He gave the sandalwood to the elder daughter and the wreath to the younger. The two girls, wishing to present their gifts to the Buddha, obtained the king's consent. The elder princess powdered the sandalwood and filled a golden box with it. The younger had the wreath made into a necklet and placed it in a golden casket. They then went to the Buddha, and the elder reverently sprinkled his body with sandalwood and scattered it in his cell with the prayer, &quot;May I, in time to come, be the mother of a Buddha like you.&quot; The younger reverently placed the necklet on the Buddha and prayed, &quot;Until I attain arahantship, may this ornament never part from my body.&quot; (J.vi.481)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Vimánavatthu Commentary (pp. 270f), Uracchadá's name was Uracchadamálá and her teacher was a brahmin named Gopála, who was also present when the Buddha preached to Uracchadamálá. But he did not acquire any special attainments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was ordained by Revata (Thag.v, 43; ThagA.i.110). He is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikáya (v.133) in a list of very eminent disciples, together with Cála, Kakkata, Kalimbha, Nikata and Katissaha. They lived in the Kútágárasálá in Vesáli, but when the Licchavis went there to visit the Buddha, they moved to the Gosingasálavana in search of quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once when the Buddha was staying in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaatiyaavana')"&gt;Játiyávana&lt;/a&gt; at Bhaddiya, Uggaha invited him and three monks to a meal at his house. At the conclusion of the meal, he asked the Buddha to speak a few words of advice to his daughters who were about to be married. The Buddha preached to them the &lt;a href="uggaha_s')"&gt;Uggaha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.36ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says that their nuptials were already in progress at the time of the Buddha's visit (AA.ii.597).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, when returning from her round, she met a monk in the street and gave him all she had in her bowl. On the second and third days she did likewise. On the fourth day, as she was going her round, she met the Buddha in a very crowded spot. She stepped back and, while doing so, she trod on the skirt of her robe which had slipped down. Unable to keep her feet, she fell down. The Buddha came up and spoke to her. She became a Sotápanna. DhA.iii.110-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One's life is short, says the devaputta; one should, therefore, gather merit, in order to gain bliss. Rather, answers the Buddha, reject the bait of all the worlds and aspire after final Peace (S.i.54).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uttara Sutta.-Preached to the monks by Uttara Thera (Uttara 6) at Mount Sankheyya at Dhavajáliká in Mahisavatthu. From time to time we should reflect on our own misfortunes as well as on those of others, and likewise on our successes. Vessavana heard this sutta being preached as he was journeying from north to south on some business. He went to Távatimsa, where he informed Sakka of what he had heard Uttara say. Sakka, thereupon, appeared before Uttara and asked him whether his sermon was based on his own illumination (patibhána), or on what he had heard from the Buddha. Uttara's reply was that his words were garnered from the Doctrine of the Buddha just as a man takes a handful of grain from a heap of grain. Sakka then repeated the whole sermon on the same subject, which be had heard the Buddha preach to the monks at Gijjhakúta in Rájagaha. A.iv.162-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambí&lt;/a&gt;. He was the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/parantapa')"&gt;Parantapa&lt;/a&gt;. His mother, when pregnant with him, was carried off by a monster-bird and deposited on a tree near the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/allakappa')"&gt;Allakappa&lt;/a&gt;. The child was born in a storm (utu?) - hence the name. Allakappa, having discovered the mother and child, took them under his protection. One day, when Udena was grown up, Allakappa saw by the conjunction of the planets that Parantapa had died. When he announced the news, Udena's mother revealed to him her identity. Allakappa taught Udena the various charms he knew for taming elephants and sent him to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambí&lt;/a&gt;, with a large following of elephants, to claim the kingdom. Some time after he became king, Udena appointed &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghosaka_setthi')"&gt;Ghosaka&lt;/a&gt; as his treasurer, and one day, having seen Ghosaka's adopted daughter, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samavati')"&gt;Sámávatí&lt;/a&gt;, going to the river to bathe, sent for her and married her. Later he married, in very romantic circumstances, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasuladattaa')"&gt;Vásuladattá&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cannda_ppajjota')"&gt;Canda Pajjota&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="ujjenii')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;. The Dhammapadatthakathá (i.161ff) contains a whole story-cycle of Udena from which these details, except where otherwise stated, are taken. For details of other persons mentioned in the article and their encounters with Udena, see under their respective names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udena had another wife, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiyaa')"&gt;Mágandiyá&lt;/a&gt;, who took advantage of her new position to wreak vengeance on the Buddha </data>
<data>for having once slighted her. When Sámávatí was converted to the Buddha's faith by her handmaiden &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khujjuttaraa')"&gt;Khujjuttará&lt;/a&gt;, Mágandiyá tried to poison the king's mind against her, but the attempt was frustrated, though Sámávatí very nearly lost her life at the king's hand. When Udena realised how grievously he had wronged her, he promised to grant her a boon, and, as the result of her choice, the Buddha sent &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; with five hundred monks to the palace every day, to preach to the women of the court. Udena himself does not seem to have been interested in religion. Once when be discovered that the women of the court had given five hundred costly robes to Ananda, he was annoyed, but when in answer to his questions Ananda explained to him that nothing given to members of the Order was wasted, he was pleased and himself made a similar offering of robes to Ananda. Mentioned also in Vin.ii.291. The incident took place after the Buddha's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His encounter in his park the &lt;a href="udakavana')"&gt;Udakavana&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pindola')"&gt;Pindola Bháradvája&lt;/a&gt;, in somewhat similar circumstances, did not, however, end so happily. Udena's women had given Pindola their robes, and when the king questioned Pindola as to the appropriateness of the gift, he remained silent. Udena threatened to have him bitten by red ants; but Pindola vanished through the air. (SnA.ii.514-5; SA.iii.27; in a previous birth too, as Mandavya, Udena had been guilty of abusing holy men, see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maatanga_jat_497')"&gt;Mátanga Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, J.iv.375ff). Later (S.iv.110f) we find him visiting Pindola again on friendly terms and receiving information as to how young members of the Order succeeded in curbing their passions in spite of their youth. In this context Udena calls himself a </data>
<data>follower of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udena had a son named Bodhi (J.iii.157), among whose activities the building of a palace, called Kokanada, is specially recorded. It is clear from the incident of the presentation of robes to Ananda, referred to above, as well as by a definite statement to that effect contained in the Petavatthu Commentary (p.140), that Udena survived the Buddha; but whether his son Bodhi succeeded him or not is not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Udena's possessions mention is made of his bow, requiring one thousand men to string it (DhA.i.216), and of his elephant Bhaddavatiká (J.iv.384).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udena is sometimes referred to as Vamsarájá (king of the Vamsas) (E.g., J.iv.375; the Dvy. e.g., 528, calls him Vatsarájá), the Vamsas or the Vacchas being the inhabitants of Kosambí.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Udána Commentary (p.382) he is called Vajjirájá. The Milinda-pañha (p.291) tells a story of a woman called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gopaalamaataa')"&gt;Gopála-mátá&lt;/a&gt;, who became a queen of Udena. She was the daughter of peasant-folk, and, being poor, she sold her hair for eight pennies, with which she gave a meal to Mahá Kaccána and his seven companions. That very day she became Udena's queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A thera. He once stayed, after the Buddha's death, in the Khemiyambavana near Benares. There the brahmin Ghotamukha visited him. Their conversation is recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghotamukha_s')"&gt;Ghotamukha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of Udena's sermon, the brahmin offered to share with him the daily allowance he received from the Anga king. This offer was refused, and at Udena's suggestion Ghotamukha built an assembly-hall for monks at Pátaliputta; this assembly-hall was named after him (M.ii.157ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Udena (9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-An upásaka of Kosala. He built a vihára for the Order, and he invited monks for its dedication, which took place during the Vassa. It being against the rules to go on a journey before the Vassa, the monks asked him to postpone the dedication. This annoyed him. When the matter was referred to the Buddha, he altered the rule so that a journey lasting not more than seven days could be undertaken during the Vassa. Vin.i.139.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Udena Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-The personal attendant of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana')"&gt;Sumana&lt;/a&gt; Buddha. Bu.v.24; J.i.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A king. He joined the Order under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kondanna')"&gt;Kondañña&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, with ninety crores of followers, all of whom became arahants. BuA.111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A yakkha. See Udena Cetiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A king, father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siddhattha')"&gt;Siddhattha&lt;/a&gt; Buddha (Bu.xvii.13); also called Jayasena (BuA.187).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A king, a former birth of Ukkhepakata-vaccha Thera (ThagA.i.148), called in the Apadána (i.56), Ekatthambhika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Udena Thera&lt;/b&gt;.-An arahant, probably identical with Udena (2). During the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a hermit, with eighty-four thousand others, living in a hermitage near Paduma-pabbata in the Himálaya. Having heard the Buddha's praises from a yakkha, he visited Padumuttara, offered him a lotus flower and spoke verses in praise of him. Ap.ii.362ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Later, Sanghamittá took up her residence there and it was enlarged by the addition of twelve buildings, three of which gained peculiar sanctity because in these were set up the mast, the rudder and the helm of the ship that had brought the Bodhi-tree to Ceylon, and these buildings were called, respectively, the Kupayatthithapita-ghara, the Piyathapita-ghara and the Arittathapita-ghara. Even when other sects arose, these twelve buildings were occupied by the Hatthálhaka (or orthodox) nuns. Mhv.xix.68ff; the Tiká (p.408) says the houses were originally called Cúlaganá-gára, Maháganágára and Sirivaddhágára. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Uposatha Suttá.-Suttas dealing with questions asked by monks of the Buddha as to why certain Nágas (egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born and born without parents) should keep the fast day, divesting themselves of their Nága forms! The Buddha replies that they do so because they wish to be born in happy states. S.iii.241f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uposatha Sutta.-One Uposatha-day, the Buddha, surrounded by the company of monks, was seated in the Migáramátu-pásáda, in Sávatthi. Looking round and finding them seated in silence, he spoke their praises, saying how some of them had won access to the devas, some to Brahma, others to the Imperturbable (ánejja), and yet others to the Ariyan state. A.ii.183f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Uposatha Sutta.-One uposatha-night, during the first watch, Ananda approaches the Buddha and asks him to recite the Pátimokkha. Three times he asks, but the Buddha remains silent, and at last says that the assembly is impure. Mahámoggallána, who is present, looks round, and seeing there a monk given up to wicked ways, asks him to leave. On his refusing to do so, Moggallána takes him by the hand and leads him away. Thereupon the Buddha proceeds to explain how, just as the sea is full of eight kinds of marvels, so is the Dhamma. A.iv.204ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Uposatha (v.l. Uposathanga) Sutta.-Visákhá, having taken the uposatha vows, visits the Buddha at noontide in the Migáramátu-pásáda. The Buddha explains to her that there are various ways of observing the sabbath; these he describes as the herdsman's sabbath, the sabbath of the naked ascetics and the sabbath of the Ariyans.

His companions were the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya')"&gt;Pañcavaggiya&lt;/a&gt;-monks, who, however, left him when he relaxed the severity of his austerities (M.i.166).

It relates that once the Bodhisatta fainted under his austerities, and the news was conveyed to his father that he was dead. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt;, however, refused to believe this, remembering the prophecy of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaaladevala')"&gt;Káladevala&lt;/a&gt;. When the Bodhisatta decided to take ordinary food again, it was given to him by a girl, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaataa')"&gt;Sujátá&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s6_siy')"&gt;Senání&lt;/a&gt; of the township of Senání. In the neighbourhood of Uruvelá were also the Ajapála Banyan-tree, the Mucalinda-tree and the Rájáyatana-tree, where the Buddha spent some time after his Enlightenment, and where various shrines, such as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/animisa_cetiya')"&gt;Animisa-cetiya&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/ratanacankama_cetiya')"&gt;Ratanacankama-cetiya&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/ratanaghara_cetiya')"&gt;Ratanaghara&lt;/a&gt; later came into existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Uruvela the Buddha </data>
<data>went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt;, but after, he had made sixty-one arahants and sent them out on tour to preach the Doctrine, he returned to Uruvelá, to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kappaasika')"&gt;Kappásikavanasanda&lt;/a&gt; and converted the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddavaggiya')"&gt;Bhaddavaggiyá&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.23f; DhA.i.72). At Uruvelá dwelt also the Tebhátika-Jatilas: &lt;a href="uruvela_kassapa')"&gt;Uruvela-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nadi_kassapa')"&gt;Nadí-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gayaa_kassapa')"&gt;Gayá-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, who all became followers of the Buddha (Vin.i.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ceylon Chronicles (E.g., Mhv.i.17ff; Dpv.i.35, 38, 81), it was while spending the rainy season at Uruvelá, waiting for the time when the Kassapa brothers should be ripe for conversion, that the Buddha, on the full-moon day of Phussa, in the ninth month after the Enlightenment, paid his first visit to Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made of several temptations of the Buddha while he dwelt at Uruvela, apart from the supreme contest with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara')"&gt;Mára&lt;/a&gt;, under the Bodhi-tree. Once Mára came to him in the darkness of the night in the guise of a terrifying elephant, trying to frighten him. On another dark night when the rain was falling drop by drop, Mára came to the Buddha and assumed various wondrous shapes, beautiful and ugly. Another time Mára tried to fill the Buddha's mind with doubt as to whether he had really broken away from all fetters and won complete Enlightenment (S.i.103ff). Seven years after the Buddha's Renunciation, Mára made one more attempt to make the Buddha discontented with his lonely lot and it was then, when Mára had gone away discomfited, that Mars's three daughters, Tanhá, Ratí and Ragá, made a final effort to draw the Buddha away from his purpose (S.i.124f).  &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;It was at Uruvelá, too, that the Buddha had misgivings in his own mind as to the usefulness of preaching the Doctrine which he had realised, to a world blinded by passions and prejudices. The Brahmá &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sahampati')"&gt;Sahampatí&lt;/a&gt; thereupon entreated the Buddha not to give way to such diffidence (S.i.136ff; Vin.i.4f). It is recorded that either on this very occasion or quite soon after, the thought arose in the Buddha's mind that the sole method of winning Nibbána was to cultivate the four &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/satipatthaana')"&gt;satipatthánas&lt;/a&gt; and that Sahampatí visited the Blessed One and confirmed his view (S.v.167; and again, 185). A different version occurs elsewhere (S.v.232), where the thought which arose in the Buddha's mind referred to the five controlling faculties (saddhindriya, etc.), and Brahmá tells the Buddha that in the time of Kassapa he had been a monk named Sahaka and that then he had practised these five faculties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Uruvela is explained as meaning a great sandbank (mahá velá, mahanto válikarási). A story is told which furnishes an alternative explanation: Before the Buddha's appearance in the world, ten thousand ascetics lived in this locality, and they decided among themselves that if any evil thought arose in the mind of any one of them, he should carry a basket of sand to a certain spot. The sand so collected eventually formed a great bank (AA.ii.476; UdA.26; MA.i.376; MT.84). In the Divyávadána (p.202), the place is called Uruvilvá. The Mahávastu (ii.207) mentions four villages as being in Uruvelá: Praskandaka, Balákalpa, Ujjangala and Jangala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Uruvelá.&lt;/b&gt;-A township in Ceylon, founded by one of the ministers of Vijaya (Dpv.ix.35; Mhv.vii.45). According to a different tradition (Mhv.ix.9; perhaps this refers to another settlement), it </data>
<data>was founded by a brother of Bhaddakacáná, called Uruvela. Uruvelá was evidently a port as well, because we are told that when Dutthagámaní decided to build the Mahá-Thúpa, six wagonloads of pearls as large as myrobalan fruit, mixed with coral, appeared on dry land at the Uruvela-pattana (Mhv.xxviii.36). Near Uruvelá was the Vallí-vihára, built by Subha (Mhv.xxxv.58).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geiger thinks (Mhv.Trs.189, n.2) that Uruvelá was near the mouth of the modern Kalá Oya, five yojanas - i.e. about forty miles - to the west of Anurádhapura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Uruvelá.&lt;/b&gt;-A village to which Queen Sugalá (q.v.) fled, taking the sacred relies, the Alms Bowl and the Tooth Relic (Cv.lxxiv.88). It is identified with Etimole about five or six miles south-east of Monorágala (Cv.Trs.ii.29, n.4). It is perhaps to be identified with Uruvelamandapa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>
