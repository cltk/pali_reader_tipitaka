Ánanda discourses to the assembled monks on the nature of the True Saint- (Bhaddekaratta). The Buddha appears on the scene and on being told of Ánanda's discourse, asks him how exactly he had proceeded. Ánanda repeats to him the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddekaratta_s')"&gt;Bhaddekaratta Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, which he had previously learnt from the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha recites it himself from beginning to end and praises Ánanda for his skill.

Ádiccabandhu&lt;/b&gt;.-An often-used epithet of the Buddha (E.g., D.iii.197; Sn.v.1128; Thag. 26, 158, 417, etc.). The Vimanavatthu Commentary (p.116) says that Ádicca (the Sun) belonged to the Gotamagotta, as did also the Buddha, hence his epithet Ádiccabandhu; other explanations are given in the same context: the Buddha is born in the same ariyá játi and is the descendant of the Sun (tam paticca tassa ariyáya játiya játattá), or the Sun is the Buddha's kinsman because the Sun is the Buddha's orasaputta (breast-born son) inasmuch as the Sun is the Buddha's disciple. It is in this sense that in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.57) the Buddha speaks of the sun as &quot;mama pajá,&quot; which Buddhaghosa (SA.i.86) explains as meaning disciple and spiritual son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ádicca is described as tapatam mukham (chief of heat-producing things). MA.ii.783.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ádiccabandhu&lt;/b&gt;.-A Pacceka Buddha who was instrumental in enabling the author (son of the King of Benares) of the twentieth verse of the Khaggavisána Sutta to become a Pacceka Buddha. Ádiccabandhu saw that the young prince, who had renounced the world and was living in his father's park near the city, did not, on account of the visits of his parents and others, have sufficient peace of mind to develop his power of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He, therefore, visited the prince and persuaded him to go into the forest by showing him how real pabbajitas lived. The first two lines of the Sutta Nipáta verse (No. 54) were uttered by Ádiccabandhu. Sn.v.54; SnA.i.104-5; see also ApA.i.105, 152.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Átumá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town that lay between Kusinárá and Sávatthi. Once the Buddha, with a large company of bhikkhus, visited the town. At that time there dwelt in it a monk who had been ordained late in life (a buddhapabbajita, identified by Buddhaghosa (DA.ii.599) with the buddhapabbajita Subhadda) and had formerly been a barber. He had two sons, handsome, elegant and well versed in the barber's art. When the monk heard of the Buddha's coming, he sent his sons from house to house to collect salt and oil and rice and meal. The young men, using all their powers of persuasion, collected a large quantity of each of these things, and when the Buddha arrived in Átumá and went to stay in the Bhúságára, they made ready rice-gruel and offered it to him. The Buddha, however, would not accept it as the monk, who had had the food collected, had been guilty of an unlawful act in that one monk had begged for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on this occasion that it was declared to be a dukkata offence for a monk, who had formerly been a barber, to carry about with him a barber's equipment (Vin.i.249-50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahá Parinibbána Sutta (D.ii.131-2) the Buddha tells Pukkusa of another occasion on which he was staying in the Bhúságára in Átumá. There was a thunderstorm and two peasants (brothers) and four oxen were struck by lightning. A large number of people having gathered at the place, one of them asked the Buddha if he were aware of the accident. But the Buddha had been in a state of concentration and had neither seen nor heard anything of it. Such was the state of calm of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ásanka Játaka (No. 380)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was an ascetic in the Himálaya. At that time a being of great merit left Távatimsa and was born as a girl in the midst of a lotus in a pool near the Bodhisatta's hermitage. The Bodhisatta, noticing some peculiarity in the growth of the lotus, swam to it and recovered the girl, whom he brought up as his daughter, giving her the name of Ásanká. Sakka, coming to visit him, saw the girl, and, inquiring what he could do for her comfort, he provided her with a crystal palace and divine food and raiment. She spent her time waiting on the Bodhisatta. The King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, having heard of her great beauty, came to the forest with a large following and asked for her hand. The Bodhisatta agreed, on condition that the king would tell him her name. The king spent a whole year trying to guess it and, having failed, was returning home in despair, when the girl, looking out of her window, told him of the creeper Ásávatí, for whose fruits gods wait for one thousand years. She thus encouraged him to try again. Another year passed and she again raised hopes in the disappointed king by relating to him the story of a crane whose hopes Sakka had fulfilled. At the end of the third year the king, disgusted by his failure, started to go home, but again the girl engaged him in conversation, and in the course of their talk the girl's name was mentioned. When the king was told that the word had occurred in his talk, he returned to the Bodhisatta and told it to him. The Bodhisatta then gave Ásanká in marriage to the king (J.iii.248-54).

He was the son of Janasandha (also called Dasaratha), and because his face was resplendent with beauty like a well-polished golden mirror, he was called Ádásamukha. His father died when he was seven years old, and the courtiers tested the boy in various ways before crowning him king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports of his wisdom soon spread abroad and once, when an old servant of his father's (Gámani Canda) was being brought to the court to answer various charges, fourteen problems were entrusted to him by different inhabitants of the kingdom to be placed before the king for solution.

A warrior sent by Brahmadatta harnessed two horses (brothers) and, sallying forth from the city, overcame six camps and captured six kings. Just then the elder horse (who was the Bodhisatta) was wounded. The charioteer unfastened the horse's armour as he lay on his side, and started to arm another horse. The Bodhisatta addressed the charioteer and said that as an Ájañña horse he must fight on. The charioteer set him on his feet again and, with his help, captured the seventh camp and its king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, having counselled the victorious king to show mercy to his captives, died, and his body was burnt with all honours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk who had given up striving.

Fleeing from there he comes to a broad sheet of water beset with danger on the hither side; the further side is secure from fear, but there is no boat and no bridge - the fivefold flood (ogha), the hither shore being sakkáya and the further shore nibbána. S.iv.172-b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ásívisa Sutta.-There are four kinds of snakes in the world: the venomous but not fierce, the fierce but not venomous, the one that is both and the one that is neither. Similarly there are four kinds of persons: the one quick to get angry but with short-lived anger, the one slow to get angry but with lasting anger, etc. (A.ii.110-11)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ásívisa Vagga.-The nineteenth chapter of the Saláyatana Samyutta of the Samyutta Nikáya.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ácámadáyiká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A family in Rájagaha was afflicted with plague and all its members died except one woman. She broke through a wall (that being the customary method of avoiding infection) and went and lived in the backyard of another house. The inmates of the house, having compassion on her, gave her the remnants of their food.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, Mahá Kassapa, rising after seven days and nights from nirodha-samápatti, knowing that he could be of use to the poor woman, appeared before her asking for alms. Having nothing but rice-water to give him, she asked him to go elsewhere, but the Elder showed his desire to accept her gift and refused alms offered to him by Sakka and by the inmates of the house behind which the woman lived.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With great joy she gave him the rice-water, and the Elder then told her that three births earlier she had been his mother. That same night she died and was born in a vimána among the Nimmánaratí gods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her story forms the basis of the Ácáma-dáyiká-Vimána Vatthu.

The Buddha tells the monks that human life is very brief and has its sequel elsewhere. Therefore good must be done and the holy life must be lived. Mars approaches the Buddha and suggests that men should take no heed of death, but should enjoy life like a babe replete with milk. The Buddha points out to him the error of such a view (S.i.108).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Áyu Sutta.-Preached at the same place, on another occasion. Mára utters the same sentiment and the Buddha refutes his views. Mára retires vanquished. S.i.108-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

For twelve years a devotee gave him his requisites including cloth for his robes; but a thief, Harantika, always stole the cloth. Discovering this, the devotee caught the rogue, beat him soundly, and, having tied him to a corpse, warned the villagers that a Yakkha would be prowling about that night, calling himself Harantika. The villagers fastened their doors and gave him no admission, even his wife refusing to recognise his voice. Then Harantika went to Maháabhaya, and having confessed his guilt, asked for protection. Maháabhaya bathed him in warm water and rubbed oil on his body, saying it was not his business to take revenge. Harantika later became a monk and attained arahantship.

Álamba.&lt;/b&gt;-Probably the name of a divine musician, one of a large number who wait on Sakka and on his wives (Vv., pp.16, 47). Dhammapála (VvA.96) quotes this view and objects to it, saying that the name is not that of a musician but of a musical instrument. The opinion that the name denotes a celestial musician seems, however, to be the right one. For a discussion see Hardy: Vimánavatthu Commentary (P.T.S.

Áyasmanta deposed the king and installed Kalyánavatí, chief queen of Kittinissanka, on the throne of Ceylon. It was he who really administered the government, the queen's power being only nominal. The Cúlavamsa calls him a man of almost unsurpassable courage, a descendant of the Khandhávara family. He slew the Adhikárin Deva and had a vihára erected at Valliggáma. He also built a parivena called after him Sarájakulavaddhana (this evidently being one of his honorific titles) and gave land and other possessions for its maintenance. He had a text-book of law compiled for the use of administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was slain by the Mahádipáda Aníkanga. Cv.lxxx.33-44.

Immediately a sapling sprang up, fifty cubits tall, with five branches, each fifty cubits long.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king poured round the tree perfumed water from eight hundred jars of gold and silver.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to consecrate the new tree, the Buddha, at Ánanda's request, sat under it for one night, in the rapture of samápatti.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the tree was planted by Ánanda, it became known as Ánandabodhi (J.iv.228-30).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilgrims who came to the Buddha at Jetavana were in the habit of paying respect to the Ánandabodhi (J.ii.321).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paduma_jat_261')"&gt;Paduma Játaka&lt;/a&gt; and the</data>

According to tradition it was here that the Buddhist scriptures were first reduced to writing in Ceylon under the patronage of a chieftain of King Vattagámani.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ábhassara&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Brahma-world where live radiant devas from whose bodies rays of light are emitted, like lightning. It belongs to the Rúpaloka and is in the plane of second jhána (Abhs. v.3; Compendium 138, n.4). The devas living there subsist on joy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(pítibhakkha) (S.i.114.; DhA.iii.258; J.vi.55). Their span of life is two kappas and there is no guarantee that a person who has been born there may not later be reborn in an unhappy condition (A.ii.127; but see Abhs. v.6, where their life-span is given as eight kappas). From time to time these devas utter shouts of joy saying &quot;aho sukham, aho sukham.&quot; This sound is the best of sounds. These devas are completely enveloped in ease (sukhena abhisaññá parisaññá) (A.iii.202; D. iii.219). Their world forms the third station of consciousness (viññánatthiti), they are of uniform body, but their perceptions are diverse (ekattakáyá nánat-tasaññino) (A.iv.40, 401; D.ii.69; D.iii.253). During the periods of the development of the world many beings are born in the Abhassara realm and they are then called the highest of the devas, yet even they change their condition (A.v.60). In lists of devas (E.g., M.i.289) they are given below the Appamánábhá and above the Subhá. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodhisattas are sometimes born in the Ábhassara world (AA.i.73; J.i.406, 473; M.i.329; , MA.i.553; SA.i.162), but they are never born in Arúpa worlds even when they have developed Arúpa-jhánas. Baka Brahmá was born in Ábhassara after having passed through Vehapphala and Subhakinna, and it was then that he conceived the belief that he was eternal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha visited him and convinced him of the error of his belief (J.iii.359). When the universe is dissolved after the lapse of a long epoch and is again evolved, beings are mostly born in the </data>
<data>Ábhassara world. When, sooner or later, the world begins to re-evolve (vivattati), the Brahmavimána appears, but it is empty. Then some being or other, either because he has finished his life there or because his merit is exhausted, leaves the Ábhassara world and is reborn in the Brahmavimána. Others follow his example, and it is then that the first to be reborn in the Brahma-world thinks of himself as Brahmá, the eternal, etc. (D.iii.29).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When inhabitants of the Ábhassara-world are reborn as humans, their existence continues to be like that which they had in the brahma-world itself. As time goes on, however, they lose their qualities and develop the characteristics, both physical and mental, of human beings (For details see D.iii.84ff., PsA.253). Buddhaghosa (DA.iii.865) says that their birth on earth is opapátika (by spontaneous regeneration) and they are mind-born (manomaya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the occasions when the world is destroyed by fire, the fire spread up to the Ábhassara-world; when by water, the water rises to the Subhakinna; when by wind, the wind reaches to the Vehapphala (CypA.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (MA.i.29; VibhA.520; cp. DA.ii.510), the Ábhassaras are so called because radiance spreads from their bodies in all directions, like flames from a torch (dandadípikáya acci viya etesam sarírato ábhá chijjitvá chijjitvá patantí viya sarati visaratí ti Abhassará).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the scholiast of the Candábha Játaka (q.v.), beings who meditate on the Sun and Moon are born in this world. The Moon appears at the wish of the Abhassara Brahmás. See Candimá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kumára-Kassapa &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kumára-Kassapa Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-He was foremost among those who had the gift of varied and versatile discourse (cittakathikánam) (A.i.24). His mother was the daughter of a banker of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;, and she, having failed to obtain her parent's consent to become a nun, married and, with her husband's consent, joined the Order, not knowing that she was with child. When her condition was discovered her colleagues consulted &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;, who declared that she was no true nun. The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, on being consulted, entrusted the matter to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaali')"&gt;Upáli&lt;/a&gt;, who had it fully investigated by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa')"&gt;Visákhá&lt;/a&gt; and other residents of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, and he gave his finding in the assembly, in the presence of the king, that the nun was innocent. (For details see J.i.148; Upáli's handling of the case won the Buddha's special commendation, see, e.g., AA.i.172). When the boy was born the king reared him, and the boy was ordained at the age of seven. The boy came to be called Kumára, because he joined the Order so young and was of royal upbringing, and also because the Buddha, when sending him little delicacies such as fruit, referred to him as Kumára Kassapa. Once when Kumára Kassapa was meditating in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhavana')"&gt;Andhavana&lt;/a&gt;, an anágámí Brahmá, who had been his companion in the time of Kassapa Buddha, appeared before him, and asked him fifteen questions which only the Buddha could answer. This led to the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vammiika_sutta')"&gt;Vammika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.143ff), and after dwelling on its teachings Kassapa </data>
<data>became an arahant. (For Kumára Kassapa's story see J.i.147ff; AA.i.158f; ThagA.i.322f; MA.i.335f). His mother, too, developed insight and attained to arahantship. It is said that she wept for twelve years because she could not be with Kassapa, and one day, seeing him in the street, as she ran towards him and fell, milk flowed from her breasts and wet her robe. Kassapa, realising that her great love was standing in the way of her attainments, spoke harshly to her that she might love him the less. The ruse succeeded and she became an arahant that very day (DhA.iii.147).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Kassapa was a learned brahmin, and having heard a monk ranked foremost in eloquence, he wished for a similar distinction and did many acts of piety towards that end. When the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were being forgotten, he, together with six others, entered the Order and lived a life of rigorous asceticism on the summit of a mountain. (Ap.ii.473f; the details of this story are given in DhA.ii.210-12; among Kassapa's companions were also Pukkusáti, Dárucíriya, Dabba Mallaputta and Sabhiya; see also UdA.80f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two verses of deep significance ascribed to Kumára-Kassapa are found in the Theragáthá (vv.201.202). Although it is said that he was a very eloquent speaker, the examples given of his preaching are extremely scanty. The Anguttara Commentary (i.159) states that the Buddha gave him his title from the skilful way in which he argued with Páyási, as related in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/payasi')"&gt;Páyási Sutta&lt;/a&gt;; but this cannot be correct for, according to&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala')"&gt;Dhammapála&lt;/a&gt; (VvA.297), the events of the Páyási Sutta took place after the Buddha's death. The Sutta, however, does justify Kassapa's reputation. (For his praises see also MA.i.500f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa's upasampadá took place in his </data>
<data>twentieth year. A doubt arose as to whether this was valid because, according to the rule, twenty years must be completed for upasampadá. The Buddha held that in reckoning the age the time spent in the mother's womb could also be included. Vin.i.93; Sp.iv.867.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Having seen a young monk begging alms, she asked her mother why men in the prime of life should renounce the world. Her mother told her of the appearance of the Buddha in the world. An upásaka who heard the conversation told her more of the Buddha and taught her the saranas and the sílas. Later he told her of the nature of the body, and she, reflecting thereon, became a sotápanna. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death she became one of Sakka's women-attendants, and her story was related to Moggallána by Sakka.

They had a monkey who provided them with amusement. One day when the ascetics went to the plains for salt and condiments, the Bodhisatta, who had been born as a brahmin ascetic named Komáyaputta, occupied their lodging; when the monkey started to play his pranks for him, the Bodhisatta snapped his fingers at him and told him to behave properly, because he lived with ascetics. The monkey thereupon became virtuous and refused to return to his evil ways, even after the arrival of his former friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told at the Pubbáráma, in reference to some monks who lived there in the apartments below those of the Buddha, and who were quarrelsome and abusive.

This opportunity occurred while they were watching a crow's nest in which a cuckoo had laid an egg. The crow watched over it and fed the young cuckoo after its birth. One day the cuckoo cried before it was grown up, and the crow killed it and threw it away. The king inquired of the Bodhisatta the reason for this, and he explained that the garrulous who talk in and out of season meet with a similar fate. The king was cured of his evil habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Kokálika, who is identified with the young cuckoo.

When he really understands the arising and the passing away of the six-fold sense sphere answers the other. Not being satisfied, the first monk asks others who, in turn, declare in similar terms of the five upádánakkhandhas, the four mahábhútas, etc. Finally he asks the Buddha, who says that the answers of the monks were like those of men who, on being asked what the kimsuka (Judas) tree was like, describe it, not as it really is, but as each one of them happens to have seen it. The Buddha explains the monk's question by means of the parable of a city, strongly guarded, having six gates and a watchful warden of the gates, receiving messengers from various quarters (S.iv.191ff).

Desiring solitude, he lived in the park of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandakii')"&gt;Dandaki&lt;/a&gt;, near Kumbhavatí in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalinga')"&gt;Kalinga&lt;/a&gt;. A certain courtesan of the city walking about in the park, having lost the king's favour, saw Kisa-Vaccha, and considering the sight an ill-omen, she spat on him and threw her tooth stick at his head. That same day she received again the patronage of the king and decided that it was as a result of spitting on the hermit. Later, when the purohita lost his office, she advised him to do as she had done, and by coincidence he, too, was restored. Some time after, the king going to quell a border rising, was advised to spit on the ascetic and throw his tooth stick at him; in this way he would find good luck. The king followed this advice, all his soldiers doing likewise. The king's general, a supporter of Kisa-Vaccha, bathed the holy man, and on being told that the Gods would destroy the kingdom unless apology were made, urged the king to apologise. The king was, however, unwilling, and the whole tract of Kalinga, sixty leagues in extent, was turned into a waste; only three people escaped unhurt - Kisa-Vaccha, the king's general, and Matuposaka Ráma. Kisa-Vaccha himself was taken in a palanquin to Sarabhanga by two of Sarabhanga's pupils (J.iii.463, 469; v.133-6; MA.ii.599ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was evidently well known in India and is often referred to (E.g., J.v.267; DA.i.266).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kisa-Vaccha is mentioned in a list of eleven sages (E .g., J.vi.99).

Thus realising, he conceives disgust for the body, etc., is repelled by them, and obtains release from them. He thereby attains freedom and becomes aware that he is free.

The king consulted Senaka and his colleagues, but they could find no solution. The deity appeared again to him and said he was like a man who, wanting a fire, blows a firefly, crumbling over it cow-dung and grass, or, wanting milk, milks the cow's horn. She then threatened the king with death if her questions were not answered. In despair, the king sent for Mahosadha (J.vi.371f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is evidently this story which is mentioned elsewhere (J.iii.197) as a separate Játaka, but no details are given, and the reader is referred to the Khajjopanaka-Pañha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The length of his reign is uncertain; he was slain by Mahánága (Cv.xli.65-92; see also Cv.Trs.i.61, n.2). Rúpavatí, queen of Parakkamabáhu I., was probably a lineal descendant of this king. Cv.lxxiii.136, 142.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kittisirimegha.-Son of Mittá, sister of Vijayabáhu I. and of a Pandu king (Pandurájá). Mánábharana and Sirivallabha were his brothers, and be married Vijayabáhu's daughter, Lokanáthá (Cv.lix.42, 44). After Vijayabáhu's death, Kittisirimegha ruled over the province of Dvádasasahassaka at Mahánágahula with Mittá and Jayabáhu I. (Cv.lxi.22-7). After the death of Mánábharana, Kittisirimegha took over also his province of Rohana (Cv.lxiii.2). When Gajabáhu succeeded Vikkamabáhu II. Kittisirimegha fought against him, but was defeated by the king's officer Gokanna, and retired to his own province, where he was later joined by Parakkamabáhu at Sankhanáyakatthalí (Cv.lxiii.20, 34, 43). Parakkama stayed with him, being adopted as his son, and his upanayana was held under Kittisirimegha's orders at Baddalatthalí (Cv.lxiv.18, 25, 36). When, however, Parakkama escaped from the prince's protection, he sent an army to capture him, but without success (Cv.lxvi.57ff). Later, Parakkama himself went to see Kittisirimegha in the company of his mother Ratnávalí, and Kittisirimegha gave orders to his followers to regard the prince as their master. He himself died soon after (Cv.xvii.16, 55, 60, 83, 87).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kittisirimegha.-Son of Mánábharana by his second queen Pabhávatí. His grandfather was Sirivallabha (Cv.lxiv.24). His father, on his deathbed, repented of the harm he had done to the Buddha's religion and asked his son to do reparation by joining Parakkamabáhu I. The </data>

The daughter of a rich man in Rájagaha looks out of her window on the seventh storey and seeing the hunter pass through the street, falls in love with him. Learning from her slave that he is leaving the city the next day, she leaves her home secretly, joins Kukkutamitta on the road and elopes with him. Seven sons are born to them who, in course of time, marry and set up households of their own. One day, perceiving that the whole family is ripe for conversion, the Buddha goes to the place where Kukkutamitta's nets are spread, leaves there his footprint and sits down under a tree. The hunter, having caught nothing, suspects that someone has set the animals free and on seeing the Buddha draws his bow. By the Buddha's power he is rooted to the spot, and likewise his sons who come with their wives to seek him. Kukkutamitta's wife also comes, and seeing what has happened exclaims in riddling phrase: &quot;Do not kill my father.&quot; (It transpires that she had become a sotápanna while yet a girl.) The family ask pardon of the Buddha, and all become sotápannas. When the monks hear of this, they complain that Kukkutamitta's wife, though a sotápanna, had all this while assisted her husband to take life. The Buddha assures them that such is not the case. A man may take poison in his hand, but if there be no wound there no harm comes to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous existence, a county treasurer bid against a city treasurer for the principal share in the building of a shrine for the relics of Kassapa Buddha. When the city treasurer bid more than the county treasurer possessed, the latter offered to devote himself to the service of the shrine, together with his wife, his seven sons and their wives. Kukkutamitta was the county treasurer. DhA.iii.24-31.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

His king, who had become an ascetic, eats a mango which had been carried by the river from this grove, and wishes for some more. He is transported by a river nymph (Uppalavanná of this age) to the mango-grove, where he hears from his erstwhile chaplain the story of his alternate bliss and misery. The Buddha related the story to some of his lay disciples who were keeping the fast (J.v.1ff). The king is identified with the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

During his stay there his thoroughbred mare foaled, and the foal was given to the woman at her request, in part payment of her charges. She brought up the foal as though he were her own child. Some time after, the Bodhisatta, who was then a householder, happened to pass the same way and discovered the thoroughbred's presence by the behaviour of his own horses. The woman agreed to part with the foal to him for a large price on condition that he should be provided with all manner of luxuries. The Bodhisatta kept his word, and when the king came to inspect his horses, made the foal, who knew his own worth, exhibit his marvellous powers. The king installed him as his state horse, and thereafter the lordship of all India passed into the king's hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Sáriputta. Once, when the Buddha was returning to Sávatthi after a tour, the citizens decided to celebrate his arrival by each one taking on himself the task of feeding a certain number of monks in the Buddha's retinue. A poor old woman wished to feed a monk, but all the monks were already allotted, only Sáriputta remaining. She invited him to her house, and he accepted her invitation. When it became known that Sáriputta was to feed with her, the king and all the rich citizens of Sávatthi sent her food and garments and money to help in her entertainment of the Elder. As a result, through the kindness of Sáriputta, she became rich in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta is identified with the thoroughbred of the Játaka (J.ii.286ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is evidently the same story as that which, in the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.325), is called the </data>
<data>Kundakasindhayapotaka Játaka. But there the story is related, not in reference to Sáriputta, but to the Buddha himself, because he accepted a cake of rice-husks from the slave-woman &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaa')"&gt;Punná&lt;/a&gt;. This is probably due to some confusion with two or more stories of similar import. See also&lt;a href="kundakapuuva_jat_109')"&gt;Kundakapúva Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It may have originated in the members of the Order being entrusted with the care of the Hair Relic (Kesadhátu), which was brought to Ceylon in the reign of Moggallána I (Cv.xxxix.49).

Kokálika (Kokáliya).&lt;/b&gt;-A monk, one of the chief partisans of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha's&lt;/a&gt; might, he was, at first, reluctant to join in Devadatta's plot against him, but later allowed himself to be persuaded on hearing the scheme explained (Vin.ii.196; iii.171). When the monks blamed Devadatta for his misdeeds, Kokálika was always ready to defend him (Vin.iii.174). When Devadatta's gains diminished, Kokálika went about praising him, his birth, accomplishments and holiness, and many believed him (J.ii.438f). He was a great friend of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_nandaa')"&gt;Thullanandá&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.iv.335). We are told that once he expressed resentment because he had never been asked to recite the texts; so one day the monks gave him his chance. He ate his favourite soup, and at sundown, wearing a blue lower robe and an outer robe of white and carrying an elegantly carved fan, he appeared in the assembly. But when he tried to recite sweat poured from his body and he was utterly confused. Henceforth the monks knew that his claim to learning was but pretence (J.ii.65f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Játakas are related showing how, in previous births also, Kokálika had come to grief because of his fondness for talk and how he had been the accomplice of Devadatta. He is identified with  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the jackal in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/daddara_jat_172_304')"&gt;Daddara Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.65ff) and the  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sihakotthuka_jat_188')"&gt;Síhakotthuka Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.108); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the ass in the lion's skin in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihacamma_jat_189')"&gt;Síhacamma   Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.110); &lt;/li&gt;</data>

There seems to be great confusions in the stories of these two men - if they were really two. In the Játaka Commentary, for instance, the introductory stories of several of the Játakas refer to the Takkáriya Játaka for details of Kokálika, obviously having in mind Devadatta's partisan; but the introductory story of the Takkáriya Játaka is identical with that related elsewhere of Cúla Kokálika. See also DhA.iv.91f, where the story of the talkative tortoise is related to Kokálika of the &lt;a href="kokaalika_jat_331')"&gt;Kokálika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; which, according to Buddhaghosa (SNA.ii.473) refers to Cúla Kokálika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vyaggha_jat_272')"&gt;Vyaggha Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.356) Kokálika is mentioned as having tried to persuade &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; to go </data>
<data>with him to his own country and as having been very angry when they refused. Possibly this story also refers to Cúla Kokálika.

Kokálika (Kokáliya)&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk, also called Cúla Kokálika to distinguish him from Kokálika (1). He was the son of Kokáli-setthi of Kokáli and lived in the monastery erected by his father in Kokáli. Once the two Chief Disciples, desiring quiet, spent the rainy season with him, he promising to tell nobody of their presence. After the rains, as the Elders were about to return, Kokálika informed the inhabitants of their stay and blamed them for not showing them hospitality. The townspeople hurried to the Elders with various offerings; these were, however, refused, and Kokálika, who had expected that the gifts would be given to him, was disappointed. The Elders promised the townsmen to visit them again, and on their return were accompanied by a large following of monks to whom the townsmen showed all honour. The gifts were divided among the monks, Kokálika not receiving a share. He thereupon became abusive, and the Chief Disciples left the place. The people were annoyed, and insisted that Kokálika should either bring them back or depart himself. The Elders refused to return, and Kokálika, in great anger, sought the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, and in spite of his injunctions spoke ill of the Chief Disciples. Having three times accused the Elders of sinful desires, he left &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, but boils immediately came out on his body, swelling and bursting. Groaning with pain, he fell down at the gate of Jetavana. His spiritual teacher, the anágámí Brahmá, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tudu')"&gt;Tudu&lt;/a&gt;, hearing his cries, came to him and begged him to seek forgiveness </data>
<data>from the Elders. But he cursed the Brahmá and refused to listen to him. Kokálika died and was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paduma')"&gt;Paduma-niraya&lt;/a&gt;. S.i.149ff; A.v.171f; SN.123f; SNA.ii.473f; J.iv.242f; AA.ii.850; SA.i.167f; DhA.iv.91f The different sources vary in a few minor details; the Játaka version is the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in reference to this incident that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkaariya_jat_481')"&gt;Takkáriya Játaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahmá &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sahampati')"&gt;Sahampati&lt;/a&gt; informed the Buddha of Kokálika's birth in the Paduma-niraya (S.i.151; SN. p.125).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kokálika Sutta was preached in reference to this Kokálika. See also Kokálika (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kokálika is mentioned as an example of a person guilty of misdemeanour regarding the Buddha's disciples (Tathágatasávake micchápatipanno).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Konágamana (Konágamana)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twenty-third in the list of the twenty-four Buddhas and the second Buddha to be born in the Bhaddakappa. He was born in the Subhagavatí Park in Sobhavatí, the capital of King Sobha, his father being the brahmin Yaññadatta and his mother Uttará. He lived in the household for three thousand years, in three palaces, Tusita, Santusita and Santuttha; his chief wife was Rucigattá and their son was Satthaváha. Konágamana left the world on an elephant and practised austerities only for six months, at the end of which time he was given milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Aggisoma and grass for his seat by the yavapálaka Tinduka. His Bodhi was an Udumbara tree. His first sermon was preached in the Migadáya near Sudassana-nagara, at the foot of a Mahá-sála tree. He held only one assembly of his disciples, who numbered thirty thousand. His body was thirty cubits in height. He died in the Pabbatáráma at the age of thirty thousand. His relics were scattered. His chief disciples were Bhíyya and Uttara among monks, and Samuddá and Uttará among nuns, his constant attendant being Sotthiya. His chief patrons were Ugga and Somadeva among laymen, and Sívalá and Sámá among laywomen. The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Pabbata of Mithilá. He held an almsgiving, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order. (D.i.7; Bu.xxiv; BuA.213ff; J.i.42f; according to the Játaka his body was twenty cubits high; Sp.i.190). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banker Ugga built for the Buddha a Sangháráma half a league in extent (J.i.94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the Buddha's birth a shower of gold fell all over Jambudípa, hence he was called Kanakágamana, Konágamana being a corrupt form of that word (BuA.213-14)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ceylon Chronicles (Dpv.ii.67; xv.25, 44, 48; xvii.9, 17, 73; Mhv.xv.91-124), Konágamana visited </data>
<data>their Island (then known as Varadípa), with thirty thousand disciples, accepted the Mahánoma garden at Vaddhamána, given by King Samiddha, and preached the doctrine. At the conclusion of his sermon, thirty thousand people realised the Truth. At the Buddha's wish, the nun Kantakánandá (v.l. Kanakadattá) brought to Ceylon a branch of the Bodhi-tree. The Buddha also preached at the Ratanamála, the Sudassanamála and the Nágamálaka and gave his girdle for the people's worship. He left Mahásumba and Kantakánandá to look after the new converts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Konágamana's time Mount Vepulla was known as Vankaka, and the people living on the mountain were called Rohitassá, their term of life being thirty thousand years (S.ii.191). Konágamana held the uposatha once a year (DhA.ii.236).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Northern books (E.g., Dvy.333; Mtu.i.114; ii.265f, 300, 302, 304, 430; iii.240-7, 330) Konágamana is called Kanakamuni, Konákamuni, and Kanakaparvata. A Thúpa, erected on the spot where Konágamana was born, is thought to have existed down to the time of Asoka, who rebuilt it to double its original size and worshipped it in his twentieth year (Hultszch: Inscrip. of Asoka, p.165). Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op. cit., ii.19) says he saw thúpas at Konágamana's birthplace and also at the spot where he met his father after the Enlightenment. Fa Hien (Travels, p.36) saw thúpas at the latter place and also at the place of the Buddha's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

This opportunity occurred while they were watching a crow's nest in which a cuckoo had laid an egg. The crow watched over it and fed the young cuckoo after its birth. One day the cuckoo cried before it was grown up, and the crow killed it and threw it away. The king inquired of the Bodhisatta the reason for this, and he explained that the garrulous who talk in and out of season meet with a similar fate. The king was cured of his evil habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Kokálika, who is identified with the young cuckoo.

It contained beautiful paintings of the renunciation of seven Buddhas, but the Elder Cittagutta (q.v.), who lived in the cave for a long time, never saw them because he had never lifted his eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a great ironwood (nága) tree at the entrance to the cave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elder, at the request of the king, once went to visit him, but after seven days, not being happy in the palace, he returned to Kurandaka.

It was once the capital of King Mahásirijeyyasúra who possessed a famous elephant, called Devanága. Buddhism was established in Ketumatí by a monk from Ceylon who was named Maháparakkama. It later became the residence of famous monks. Sás., pp.80, 81; see also 101, 118, 162.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ninety-one kappas ago he saw the footprint of the Buddha Vipassí and offered to it a koranda-plant in bloom. Fifty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Vítamala (Ap.i.206). He is probably to be identified with Ramaníyavihárí. ThagA.i.116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Korandapupphiya Thera.-An arahant. He was a woodsman in the time of Tissa Buddha, and having seen three footprints of the Buddha, he offered to him a flowering koranda-plant. In all subsequent births his skin was the colour of the koranda-flower. The same verses appear in two places in the Apadána with very slight variations (Ap.ii.383, 434). Perhaps these are two distinct persons, because in the Theragáthá Commentary the verses appear twice - once under the name of Sugandha (ThagA.i.81) and once under that of Sabbamitta (ThagA.i.270).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the youngest son of Abhaya, a householder of Mahisadonika in the Nakulanaga district. His name was Deva, but because of a slight limp he came to be known as Khañjadeva. When out hunting with the villagers, he would chase and catch buffaloes, grasp their leg with his hand, whirl them round his head and dash them on the ground, breaking their bones. Kákavannatissa, hearing of this, caused him to be brought to the court. Later, Khañjadeva took part in Dutthagámaní's campaigns. Mhv.xxiii.3, 78ff.

After death he was born as heir to the king of Benares, and made the daughter of the Kosala king his chief queen. Remembering his previous life, he composed a song about it; the song became very popular, though no one understood its import. The queen, having been promised a boon, chose to know the meaning of the song, and the king, having summoned the people from twelve leagues round, explained the allusions. The queen, too, revealed how she had once been a slave in the court of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambahattha')"&gt;Ambattha&lt;/a&gt; and had given alms to a holy monk.

For ages they spend their time in laughter and in sport of sensual lusts. In consequence their self-possession is corrupted and they fall from their state (D.i.19; PsA.441; NidA.i.108). They are so called because they are corrupted and are destroyed by sport (khiddáya padussanti, vinassanti) (DA.i.113). It is said that while playing about in such pleasances as Nandanavana, Cittalatávana and Phárusakavana, they forget to eat and drink and fade away like flowers. Their death is due to self-consciousness (attasañcetaná) (AA.ii.544). They are, as it were, burnt up by their infatuation (mohassa anudaha-natáya-mohanavasena hi tesam satisammoso) (VibhA.498). They were present at the preaching of the Mahásamaya Sutta (D.ii.260). v.l.

He welcomed them and asked them the stories of their renunciation. Having heard them, both he and his wife wished to leave the world, but his wife, deceiving him, went before him, leaving him to look after their son and daughter. When the children were old enough he, too, became an ascetic, and though he met his wife later he refused to have anything to do with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son was Ráhula and the daughter Uppalavanná, the wife being Ráhulamátá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to five hundred monks who had lustful thoughts at midnight.

It is generally acknowledged (for a discussion see Law, Páli Lit., i.7f; 34f) that the work is of later composition and that it contains extracts from earlier works.

After death he was born as one of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Cátummakárájika-devas&lt;/a&gt; (DA.iii.966; SNA.i.369f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In literature the name Kuvera signifies the god of wealth, and his city, Álakamandá, is said to embody all prosperity (E.g., Cv.xxxvii.106; xxxix.5; lxxx.5).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had nine treasures (Cv.lxxxvii.31; see Hopkins' Epic Mythology, 142f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yakkha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaka')"&gt;Punnaka&lt;/a&gt; calls himself the minister of Kuvera (J.vi.307, 325).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuvera is mentioned in a list of those who reached heaven through generosity (J.vi.201).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kundadhána Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He was proclaimed the first among those who received food tickets (saláka) (A.i.24). He came of a brahmin family of Sávatthi and his name was Dhána. He knew the Vedas by heart, and when advanced in years, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order. From that day, however, in all his movements the form of a young woman followed him wherever he went, though he himself could not see the figure. This caused great merriment and evoked many sarcastic remarks, which he could not understand. When he went for alms women would put into his bowl two portions of food, saying, &quot;One is for your Reverence and the other for your friend, the young lady, your companion.&quot; In the monastery the novices and young monks would point at him and say: &quot;Look, our venerable one has become a konda&quot; (gallant?). From this he became known as Konda- or Kundadhána. Driven to distraction by this teasing, he became abusive and was reported to the Buddha, who hade him be patient as he was only being pursued by the remnant of an evil kamma. Pasenadi, king of Kosala, hearing of Kundadhána, was interested, and being satisfied by personal investigation that the Elder was blameless, provided him with all necessaries, so that he need no longer go round for alms. This enabled him to concentrate his mind, and he became an arahant. Thereupon the figure of the woman disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kundadhána's claim to be the first among receivers of saláka was due to the fact that he it was who received the first food-ticket when the Buddha visited &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mahá-Subhaddá at Ugganagara,   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Culla-Subhaddá at Sáketa, and also  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the Sunáparanta-janapada. &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only khínásavas were allowed to accompany the Buddha on these visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kundadhána's determination to attain this special eminence was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. Once he gave Padumuttara a well-ripened &quot;comb&quot; of bananas when the Buddha arose from a long trance. As a result he became king of the devas eleven times and king of men twenty-four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was an earthbound sprite in the time of Kassapa Buddha. Seeing two monks, firm friends, on their way to the uposatha held by the Buddha, he had a mischievous desire to test their friendship, and when one of the monks retired into the forest leaving the other on the road, he followed the former, unseen by him, assuming the form of a woman arranging her hair, adjusting her garments, and so on. The second monk, seeing his friend return and shocked by his apparent misdemeanour, left him in disgust, refusing to perform the uposatha with him. Realising the effect of his practical joke, the sprite did all he could to make amends, but the friendship of the two monks was for ever spoilt. The sprite suffered the fears of hell for a whole Buddha-era, and even in his last birth as Kundadhána his evil kamma pursued him, as seen above. AA.i.146ff; Thag.A.i.62ff; also Ap.i.81f; Thag.15. The version given in Dh A.iii.52f differs very slightly in certain details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kundadhána was among those to whom the Buddha preached the Nalakapána Sutta, and was therefore probably a friend of Anuruddha and the other Sákyan nobles present on that occasion (M.i.462). v.l. Konda-dhána, Konthadhána, Kuddadhána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There was a monastery on Kotapabbatta called the Kotapabbata-vihára. This was the residence of the Sámanera who was afterwards born as Dutthagámaní (Mhv.xxii.25); also of Mahá-Summa Thera (Mhv.xxiii.61), of Asubhakammika-Tissa and of his teacher Mahá-Tissa (MT.553). The Vihára was near Mahágáma (MT.553).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Visuddhi Magga (p.292) mentions an Elder, Tissa, of Kota (Koti) pabbata, who, having attained arahantship through meditation on breathing, was able to limit the term of his life. According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iv.50), an Elder named Anula lived in the monastery during the time of Dutthagámaní, and the village Bhokkanta, residence of Sumaná, wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, was in its vicinity. It was probably the same as Gotapabbata (q.v.) (See Mhv.xxxv.124; MT.667). The Nágalena was in the Kotapabbata-vihára (DA.ii.695).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Koka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hunter. While on his way to the forest with his dogs he meets a monk. He bags no game that day and blames the monk, whom he again meets on his way home. Koka sets his dogs on the monk, and when the latter climbs a tree, pierces the soles of his feet with arrows. The monk's cloak falls upon the hunter, completely covering him. The dogs, thinking that the monk has fallen from the tree, devour their own master. The monk, fearing that he is to blame, seeks the Buddha, who reassures him and relates the story of a wicked physician who cajoled a boy into catching a snake, pretending that it was a bird. When the boy discovered that it was a snake, he threw it on the physician's head, who died from its bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physician is identified with Koka. DhA.iii.31f. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the past is evidently derived from the Sáliya Játaka, which, however, according to the Játaka Commentary, was related in reference, not to Koka, but to Devadatta.

Sáriputta visited the Buddha, taking with him a young man, son of a friend of his father. The youth had joined the Order under Sáriputta renouncing his immense wealth, but he could gain no attainment. Sáriputta desired him to hear an exposition by the Buddha, hence his question (SnA.i.331).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One who aspires to the highest good should not be envious, obstinate, or careless, but diligent in his training, cultivating self-restraint and chastity, intent in the dhamma, making the dhamma his first and last concern (Sn.pp.56f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is the ninth of the Culla Vagga of the Sutta Nipáta, and derives its name from the first word (kimsilo) in Sáriputta's question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The village was one gávuta distant from the Ganges (MT.560). The Buddha went there from Bhaddiyanagara. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddaji_th')"&gt;Bhaddaji&lt;/a&gt; preceded the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; to Kotigáma and awaited his arrival there. The people, led by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanduttara')"&gt;Nanduttara&lt;/a&gt;, made ready a meal and provided boats in which the Buddha and the monks might cross the river. In the middle of the river, submerged in the water, stood the palace once occupied by  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapanaada')"&gt;Mahápanáda&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.332f; ThagA.i.287f; Mhv.xxxi.5f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his last tour the Buddha crossed the river at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama')"&gt;Pátaligáma&lt;/a&gt;, went on to Kotigáma, and remained in that village preaching to the monks.

Kosiya, Kosiyagotta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a brahmin clan. In the Pácittiya it is given as one of the lower gottas. (Vin.iv.8; but it is also Sakka's gotta, and is therefore generally regarded as a high one; see e.g., Thag.415; ThagA.i.452).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those mentioned as belonging to this gotta are the brahmin Kevatta (J.vi.418f), the brahmin who was the father of Sona Kumára (the Bodhisatta) (J.v.319ff), Bhaddákápiláni, born in Ságala (AA.i.99; ThagA.68; SA ii.144), and the banker who came to be known as Macchariya-Kosiya (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kátiyána's father was a Kosiyan, but he married a woman of the Kátiyána family (ThagA.i.452).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhuridatta_jat_543')"&gt;Bhúridatta Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.181; Mtu.ii.49) mentions a sage Kosiya, who taught Alambáyana the Nága-spell. The scholiast says he belonged to the Kosiyagotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/salikedara_jat484')"&gt;Sálikedára Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.278f) mentions a brahmin of Sálindiya, called Kosiyagotta, probably for the same reason.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="kosiya_jat_130_226_470')"&gt;Kosiya Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.465f) speaks of a Kosiya-bráhmaní. All these are either addressed or spoken of as Kosiya in their different contexts. The name Kosiya is also used twice in speaking of Sakka - once by the Buddha (D.ii.270), once by Mahá Moggallána (M.i.252) - and again by Guttila (J.ii.252) and by Mahá Kassapa (Ud.iii.7; UdA.200; DhA.i.429).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name means &quot;belonging to the Kusika family.&quot; It is once used of Indra in the Rg Veda, in what exact sense is not known. Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.ii.296f; see also Dvy.632; Mtu.iii.200, 202, </data>
<data>315, 403) that perhaps we have here a survival from the time when Indra was only the god of a Kusika clan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word Kosiya (e.g., J.ii.208) means &quot;Owl&quot; and is probably one of the several clan names which are also names of animals (cf. Vaccha).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kosiya&lt;/b&gt;.-See Macchari-Kosiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kosiya Thera&lt;/b&gt;.-An arahant. He belonged to a brahmin family in Magadha and was called by his gotta-name. He often listened to the preaching of Sáriputta and, joining the Order, in due course won arahant ship. He was a gate-keeper of Bandhumatí and in the time of Vipassí Buddha gave to the Buddha a piece of sugar-cane. (Thag.370-4; ThagA.i.431f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Ucchukandika of the Apadána. Ap.ii.393.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Kosiya&lt;/b&gt;.-See Kosika (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Kosiya.&lt;/b&gt;-See Nanda Mánava.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Tradition says (See, e.g., Saddhamma-Sangaha, p.55) that it was written in Sinhalese, and was so called because it was compiled in the Kurundavelu-Vihára in Ceylon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to have been chiefly concerned with Vinaya rules, for we find frequent references to it; particularly in the Samantapásádiká. E.g., Sp.i.281; ii.319; iii.537, 544, 545, 573, 583, 597, 616, 620, 626, 627, 660, 664, 668, 688, 722, 726; iv.745, 758, 778, 783, 789, 813, 818, 861, 920, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also called Kurundí-gandha (Gv.59).

Kotthita Sutta.-A conversation between Mahá Kotthita and Sáriputta as to whether or not anything exists after the passionless ending, without remainder, of the six spheres of contact (phassáyata nánam asesaviráganirodhá). The conversation is repeated between Mahá Kotthita and Ananda. A.ii.161f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kotthita Sutta.-Mahá Kotthita asks Sáriputta a series of questions as to why the holy life (brahmacariyá) is lived by the Blessed One, to all of which Sáriputta answers &quot;No.&quot; He then goes on to explain that the purpose of the holy life is the realisation of the four Ariyan truths. A.iv.382f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kotthita Sutta.-Three suttas. Mahá Kotthita visits the Buddha and asks for a brief statement of the Dhamma. The Buddha answers that desire should be put away for that which is (1) impermanent, (2) Ill, (3) without a self. S.iv.145f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kotthita Sutta.-Kotthita visits Sáriputta at Isipatana and asks him which is true: to say that the eye is the bond of objects or that objects are the bond of the eye? Sáriputta replies that neither is true: the bond consists in the desire and lust arising from their contact. If two men be yoked one to the other, the bond consists not in either of the men but in the yoke-tie which binds them. If this were not so, the religious life would be purposeless. S.iv.162f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Kotthita Sutta.-A group of three suttas containing conversations between Mahá Kotthita and Sáriputta on what constitutes ignorance.

It was told in reference to a backsliding monk who fell in love with a woman in Sávatthi, neglected all his duties and refused food. He was taken to the Buddha, who related this story to show how even mighty men may lose their power and come to misery through love of a woman. (J.v.278ff; the story is also given in Mtu.iii.1ff; ii.441f; the details differ, as do some of the names, from the Páli version).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story bears much resemblance to that of Anitthigandha (q.v.).

Kosala Sutta.-While Pasenadi is visiting the Buddha, a messenger arrives and announces the death of Malliká. The king is greatly grieved, but the Buddha consoles him by pointing out how it is impossible to escape old age, decay, disease, destruction. A.iii.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kosala Sutta.-Everything changes, even Pasenadi, king of Kási-Kosala, the whole universe, even Mahá Brahmá and the devas of the Abhassara world. Instability and change are everywhere; therefore the wise loathe all, having a mind only to attain in this life the anupadáparinibbána (A.v.59ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kosala Sutta.-Pasenadi visits the Buddha at Jetavana after having won a battle, and, falling at the Buddha's feet, shows great humility and does obeisance. When the Buddha asks the reason for such profound homage, the king gives various reasons for his honouring of the Buddha (A.v.65ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

ThigA.25; Ap.ii.608.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khemaka Thera.-An arahant. Once, when he lay very ill at the Badarikárámá, near Kosambí, some monks, staying at the Ghositáráma, sent one of their number, Dásaka, with a message to Khemaka, inquiring whether he managed to bear his pains. Dásaka returned with the reply that he did not; he was sent again to ask if Khemaka had seen the self in the five khandhas; when Dásaka returned with the answer that he had not, be was sent a third time to ask whether Khemaka was an arahant. &quot;No,&quot; came the answer, and Dásaka had to visit him a fourth time with the inquiry, What did Khemaka mean by self? In exasperation Khemaka came himself to Ghositáráma and explained how, even when the Noble Disciple has put away the five lower fetters, there still clings to him a subtle remnant of the &quot;I&quot; conceit. It is said that as a result of the sermon Khemaka himself and sixty others became arahants (S.iii.126ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.ii.230f) explains that the monks wished to hear Khemaka because they knew his ability, and they also knew that if they showed keenness to learn he would come to them. They did not go to him because his but was small, and they did not actually ask him to come to them because he was ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Khemaka, Khema, Khemanesáda.-The name given to the fowler who caught the golden swan from Cittakúta, at the request of King Seyya (v.l. Samyama), as narrated in the Maháhamsa Játaka (q.v.). Khemaka received his name from the lake Khema, of which he was in charge. He is identified with Channa (J.v.356ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Khemaka.-See Khemavatí.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kimbilá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town on the banks of the Ganges. It was in a veluvana (more probably a niceluvana; the Anguttara Commentary ii.642 explains it as a Mucalindavana) there the Buddha stayed and where the Kimbila and Kimbilá Suttas were preached (A.iii.247, etc.; S.iv.181f; v.322).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.642), it was the birthplace of the setthiputta Kimbila (Kimbila 2). The city existed in the time of Kassapa Buddha and was the residence of the woman who later became Kannamundapetí (Pv.12; PvA.151). Among the palaces seen by Nimi when he visited heaven was that of a deva who had been a very pious man of Kimbilá (J.vi.121). Another such pious person of the same city was Rohaka with his wife Bhadditthiká. Vv.xxii.4; VvA.109.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha sent for them and impressed on them that all his teachings were based on experience and knowledge and should therefore be followed by them.

He was converted with Bhaddiya and four other Sákyan nobles at Anupiyá, shortly after the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu (Vin.ii.182; DhA.i.112f). The Theragáthá Commentary says (ThagA.i.235f; Thag.118, 155f, According to DhA.i.117, Kimbila became an arahant soon after ordination together with Bhagu; see also J.i.140 and AA.i.108) that while at Anupiyá the Buddha, in order to arouse Kimbila, conjured up a beautiful woman in her prime and then showed her to him passing into old age. Greatly agitated, Kimbila sought the Buddha, heard the Doctrine and, having entered the Order, in due course won arahantship. Kimbila seems to have maintained throughout his early friendship with Anuruddha, dwelling with him and Nandiya, now in this wood or park, now in that. The Buddha visited them at Pácína-vamsadáya when he was going away, disgusted with the recalcitrant monks of Kosambí. (Vin.i.350; J.iii.489; see also Upakkilesa Sutta, M.iii.155ff and ThagA.i.275f). They were in the Gosingasálavana when the Buddha preached to them the Cúla-Gosinga Sutta, at the conclusion of which, Dígha Parajana Yakkha sang the praises of all three (M.i.205ff). Their number was increased by the presence of Bhagu, Kundadhána, Revata and Ananda, on the occasion when the Buddha preached the Nalakapána Sutta in the Palásavana at Nalakapána (M.i.462ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In three different places in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.iii.247; 339; iv.84) record is made of a conversation between Kimbila and the Buddha, when Kimbila asks how the Dhamma could be made to endure long after the Buddha's death and what were the causes which might bring about its early disappearance. The conversation took place in the Veluvana (Niceluvana?) in Kimbilá. According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.642), </data>
<data>however, it would appear that the Kimbila mentioned here was not Kimbila the Sákyan but another. We are told that this Kimbila was a setthiputta of Kimbilá. He joined the Order and acquired the power of knowing his previous births. He recollected how he had been a monk at the time when Kassapa Buddha's religion was falling into decay, and seeing how the Faith was neglected by its followers, he made a stairway up a cliff and lived there as a recluse. It was this memory of his previous life which prompted Kimbila's question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere (S.v.322f ) the Buddha is reported as questioning Kimbila at the same spot on the question of breathing. Kimbila remains silent though the question is put three times. Ananda intervenes and suggests that the Buddha should himself furnish the answer so that the monks may learn it and profit thereby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, Kimbila had been a householder; after the Buddha's death he erected a pavilion of salala-garlands round his cetiya (ThagA.i.235). He is probably to be identified with Salalamandapiya Thera of the Apadána (Ap.i.333).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.115; iv.126) mentions a story which shows how delicately nurtured Kimbila was. One day, in a discussion with his friends, Anuruddha and Bhaddiya, as to where rice came from, Kimbila remarked that it came from the granary (kotthe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Ninety-one kappas ago he saw the footprint of the Buddha Vipassí and offered to it a koranda-plant in bloom. Fifty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Vítamala (Ap.i.206). He is probably to be identified with Ramaníyavihárí. ThagA.i.116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Korandapupphiya Thera.-An arahant. He was a woodsman in the time of Tissa Buddha, and having seen three footprints of the Buddha, he offered to him a flowering koranda-plant. In all subsequent births his skin was the colour of the koranda-flower. The same verses appear in two places in the Apadána with very slight variations (Ap.ii.383, 434). Perhaps these are two distinct persons, because in the Theragáthá Commentary the verses appear twice - once under the name of Sugandha (ThagA.i.81) and once under that of Sabbamitta (ThagA.i.270).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kukkura Játaka (No 22).-Because his carriage straps, left in the rain, are gnawed by his own dogs, the king of Benares orders all dogs except his own to be killed indiscriminately. The Bodhisatta, who is the leader of the pack of dogs in the cemetery, visits the king, points out to him his iniquity, and reveals the truth by causing an emetic to be administered to the king's dogs. Having convinced the king, the Bodhisatta teaches him the ten stanzas of Righteousness found in the Tesakuna Játaka (dhammañ cara mahárája, etc.) (J.v.123). Great are the benefactions made to dogs thereafter. The Bodhisatta's teaching lasted for ten thousand years under the name of Kukkurováda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king is identified with Ananda (J.i.175ff). The occasion for the story is given in the Bhaddasála Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kukkura Játaka.-See Kakkara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

They had a monkey who provided them with amusement. One day when the ascetics went to the plains for salt and condiments, the Bodhisatta, who had been born as a brahmin ascetic named Komáyaputta, occupied their lodging; when the monkey started to play his pranks for him, the Bodhisatta snapped his fingers at him and told him to behave properly, because he lived with ascetics. The monkey thereupon became virtuous and refused to return to his evil ways, even after the arrival of his former friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told at the Pubbáráma, in reference to some monks who lived there in the apartments below those of the Buddha, and who were quarrelsome and abusive.

The chaplain took bribes, and the king's son, Candakumára, having been told of this, once righted a wrong decision, thereby winning the applause of the people. The king appointed him judge, and Khandahála vowed vengeance. Later the king, having dreamed of heaven, asked Khandahála the way thither; the chaplain replied that the way lay through a sacrifice in which all the king's sons, his queens, his merchant princes, and his most treasured possessions should be offered. Khandahála hoped thereby to bring about the death of Candakumára. Ekarájá accepted the suggestion and made all preparations for the sacrifice. Several times the king wavered in his resolve, being interceded with by his parents, Canda and his wives, and the people. Khandahála goaded him on, but at the moment when the sword was about to descend on the neck of Candakumára, the latter's wife, Candá, daughter of the Pañcála king, made an &quot;act of truth,&quot; and Sakka appeared, brandishing a thunderbolt. Canda was saved, the crowd killed Khandahála, and would have killed the king too but for the intervention of Sakka.

He was carried about on a stick by two birds while in front, behind, above and below flew his vast retinue, guarding him from all harm and providing for all his needs. He distrusted and despised all womankind, and his stories of their wiles, as related by him to his friend &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnamukha')"&gt;Punnamukha&lt;/a&gt;, are given in the &lt;a href="kunaala_jat_536')"&gt;Kunála Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha explains that, according to his own teaching, rebirth comes only to a being who has fuel, the fuel being craving (S.iv.398f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion arises out of a conversation which, according to Vacchagotta, took place among paribbájakas in the Kutúhalasálá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.369; MA.ii.694) that there was no special place of that name; any place where discussions were held could be so called.

Kevatta (1) visits the Buddha and asks him to order a monk to perform some mystic wonder in order to increase the faith of the Buddha's followers. The Buddha expresses his hatred of miracles and tells Kevatta that a greater and better wonder than any or all of them is education in the system of self-training which culminates in Arahantship. In illustration of this, he relates a legend: A monk, seeking the answer to the question &quot;Where do the elements pass away?&quot; goes up and up, by the power of his iddhi, from world to world, asking the gods for an answer. In each heaven he is referred to those who are higher up, until he comes at last to the Great Brahmá himself, who takes him aside and tells him that he does not know the answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monk seeks the Buddha, who explains to him that the question is wrongly put; it should be, &quot;Where do the elements find no foothold; where do náma and rúpa pass away?&quot; And the answer is, &quot;In the mind of the arahant, when intellect (viññána) ceases, then náma and rúpa cease.&quot; D.i.211ff; cp.

The latter, coveting the gold, hid it elsewhere, and took leave of the squire as though he were going to some other part of the country. The squire, after pressing him in vain to stay, accompanied him part of the way. Suddenly the ascetic stopped and said he had found a straw from the roof of the hermitage sticking to his hair and wished to restore it as it did not belong to him. The squire was greatly impressed by this show of non-covetousness, but another ascetic, who was the Bodhisatta, observing what happened and guessing the reason, communicated his suspicions to the squire. When they searched for the gold it could not be found, but the ascetic confessed his guilt after a sound thrashing (J.i.375ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The occasion for the telling of the story is given in the Uddála Játaka. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Koliyá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the republican clans in the time of the Buddha. The Koliyá owned two chief settlements - one at Rámagáma and the other at Devadaha. The Commentaries (DA.i.260f; SNA.i.356f; A.ii.558; ThagA.i.546; also Ap.i.94) contain accounts of the origin of the Koliyas. We are told that a king of Benares, named Ráma (the Mtu.i.353 calls him Kola and explains from this the name of the Koliyas), suffered from leprosy, and being detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and retired into the forest. There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon recovered, and, while wandering about, came across Piyá, the eldest of the five daughters of Okkáka, she herself being afflicted with leprosy. Ráma, having cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons. With the help of the king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in doing so. The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site was discovered on a tiger-track (vyagghapatha) it was also called Vyagghapajjá. The descendants of the king were known as Koliyá. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Kunálá Játaka (J.v.413), when the Sákyans wished to abuse the Koliyans, they said that the Koliyans had once &quot;lived like animals in a Kola-tree,&quot; as their name signified. The territories of the Sákiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohiní. The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed relationship with the Buddha. (It is said that once the Koliyan youths carried away many Sákiyan maidens while they were bathing, but the Sákiyans, regarding the Koliyans as relatives, took no action; DA.i.262). A quarrel once arose between the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohiní, which irrigated </data>
<data>the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention of the Buddha. In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the membership of the Order, and during the Buddha's stay in the neighbourhood, he lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara. (For details of this quarrel and its consequences see J.v.412ff; DA.ii.672ff; DhA.iii.254ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attached probably to the Koliyan central authorities, was a special body of officials, presumably police, who wore a distinguishing headdress with a drooping crest (Lambacúlakábhatá). They bore a bad reputation for extortion and violence (S.iv.341).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the places already mentioned, several other townships of the Koliyans, visited by the Buddha or by his disciples, are mentioned in literature - e.g.,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Uttara, the residence of the headman Pátaliya (S.iv.340); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sajjanela, residence of Suppavásá (A.ii.62); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sápúga, where Ananda once stayed (A.ii.194); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Kakkarapatta, where lived Díghajánu (A.iv.281); and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Haliddavasana, residence of the ascetics Punna Koliyaputta and Seniya (M.i.387; see also S.v.115). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nisabha (ThagA.i.318), Kakudha (SA.i.89) (attendant of Moggallána), and Kankhá-Revata (Ap.ii.491) (and perhaps Sona Kolivisa, q.v.), were also Koliyans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death the Koliyans of Rámagáma claimed and obtained one-eighth of the Buddha's relics, over which they erected a thúpa (D.ii.167; Mhv.xxi.18, 22ff).

He made old men roll about on the ground and played practical jokes on old women. His friends behaved likewise. All old people left his country; no parents or aged persons remained to be tended by the young, and newcomers among the gods were few in number. Sakka (the Bodhisatta), wishing to teach the king a lesson, once appeared before him in the guise of an old man, with two jars of butter milk in a crazy old cart, having willed that only the king should be able to see him. The king was riding his state elephant, and when he asked the old tarter to move the latter dashed the two jars on the king's head and the onlookers laughed to see the milk dripping down his face. Resuming Sakka's form, the Bodhisatta admonished the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to account for Lakuntaka Bhaddiya's deformity.

He lived in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aapana')"&gt;Ápana&lt;/a&gt;, and when the Buddha once stayed there with one thousand three hundred and fifty monks, Keniya visited the Buddha, bringing various kinds of drinks, which he gave to him and to the monks. The following day he invited the whole company to a meal and showed great hospitality. It was as a result of the drinks offered by Keniya that the Buddha laid down a rule as to which drinks were permissible for monks and which were not (Vin.i.245f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Sutta Nipáta (p.104; M.ii.146f; see also ThagA.ii.47), it was owing to the elaborate preparations made by Keniya for the meal to the Buddha and the Sangha that the brahmin Sela, friend and counsellor of Keniya, came to discover the Buddha's presence in Ápana. The result was the conversion and ordination of Sela and his three hundred pupils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.440; MA.ii.779; Ap.i.318) that Keniya was a mahásála-brahmin, and that he became a Jatila with the object of protecting his wealth. He bought some land from the king and built his hermitage there, and became the protector (nissaya) of one thousand families. In his hermitage was a palm tree which yielded a golden nut each day. Keniya was a yellow-robed ascetic by day; by night he enjoyed the pleasures of the senses. On his first visit to the Buddha he took five hundred pingo-loads of badarapána (SNA.ii.446) (? grape juice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keniya is mentioned (E.g., DA.i.270; see also DhA.i.323; UdA.241) as an example of one of the eight classes of ascetics - those who maintain wife and children (sa-puttabhariya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

He was born in a brahmin family in Sávatthi, and having heard of the supernormal powers of Mahá Moggallána entered the Order, wishing to attain to a like proficiency. He developed sixfold abhiññá and great supernormal powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a yakkha chief, and when he saw the Buddha and greeted him, the Buddha, to his great joy, preached to him. Eighty kappas ago he became king under the name of Sumangala (Thag.v.104; ThagA.i.209f). He is probably identical with Supáricariya of the Apadána. Ap.i.181.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khitaka Thera.-An arahant. He was born in a brahmin family of Kosala and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order, in due course winning arahantship. Later he dwelt in the forest, stirring enthusiasm in the forest-dwelling monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he was a park-keeper, and having seen the Buddha going through the air offered him a coconut fruit, which the Buddha stopped to accept (Thag.vv.191-2; ThagA.315f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Nálikeradáyaka Thera of the Apadána (Ap.ii.447f). His Apadána verses are also found under the name of Kundala Thera.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kirapatika&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A household of Vesalí, a pious follower of the Buddha. Once when the Buddha was staying in Vesalí, a poor man, wishing to give alms to him and to the monks, asked Kirapatika for money to provide the alms; Kirapatika gladly gave him much money and the Buddha and the monks were invited. But the monks, having heard of the man's poverty, had a full meal earlier, so that when the man served them with the food he had prepared they could eat but very little. The man was greatly offended and the Buddha, hearing of it, made an order to the monks prohibiting such conduct (Vin.iv.75f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (Sp.iv.817) that the householder's name was Kira, but that he was called Kirapatika on account of his great influence. He gave his workmen regular and generous wages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

With her assistance he killed the Yakkhas at their feast in Sirísivatthu. Later Vijaya discarded her in favour of a royal maiden from Madhurá, and she left, with her two children Jívahattha and Dipellá, for Lankápura, where she was slain as a spy. Her children fled to Malaya and their descendants became the Pulindas (Mhv.vii.9-68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuvanná had as companion a slave called Sisapátí (Sísapátiká). v.l.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kukkutavatí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to some accounts the city, where Mahá Kappina ruled before he became a monk, is called, not Kukkuta (q.v.), but Kukkutavatí. Perhaps the former was the name of the county and the latter that of its capital. From here to Sávatthi was a distance of one hundred and twenty leagues, and there was a trade route between the two cities which merchants travelled on foot (janghavánijá), and also a route from the Majjhimadesa. Three rivers had to be crossed on the way: the Aravacchá, the Nílaváhaná and the Candabhágá. DhA.ii.116ff; a less detailed account is given in SA.ii.177f and AA.i.175f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Korabya, Koravya, Korabba&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the generic name given to the king of the Kurús (cf. Brahmadatta). Once in the Játakas Koravya is given as the name of the king of Indapatta in the Kuru country, this king being the father of Sutasoma (J.v.457). Elsewhere (J.ii.368; iii.400, 402; v.59, 61, 65; vi.256, 268, 273) Koravya appears as a title of Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurús. Koravya may also have been used as an adjective, for we find it explained as Kururatthavásika (E.g., J.vi.273). The Koravya king probably belonged to the Yudhitthilagotta (See J.iv.361). The Anguttara Nikáya (iii.369f) mentions a king Koravya who owned a large banyan tree named Suppatittha. According to the Ratthapála Sutta (M.ii.65; see also Thag.776.ff; ThagA.ii.34; for details see Ratthapála), in the Buddha's day, too, the ruler of Kuru was called Koravyarájá, and he owned a park which seems to have been called Migácíra (q.v.). This king was evidently interested in religious discussion. Thullakotthika was his capital. The Avadánasataka (i.67; ii.118; see also Camb. Hist. of India, i.121, which refers to a half-mythical Pañcála king, Kraivya) speaks of a Kauravya of Thullakotthika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kosambí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of the Vatsas or Vamsas (J.iv.28; vi.236). In the time of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;. (MA.ii.740f; DhA.i.164f). Kosambí was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha's Parinibbána (D.ii.146,169). It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to &lt;a href="kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt; from the south and the west. (See, e.g., Vin.i.277). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city was thirty leagues by river from Benares. (Thus we are told that the fish which swallowed &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakkula')"&gt;Bakkula&lt;/a&gt; travelled thirty leagues through the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamunaa')"&gt;Yamuná&lt;/a&gt;, from Kosambí to Benares, AA.i.170; PsA.491). The usual route from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; to Kosambí was up the river (this was the route taken by Ananda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt;, Vin.ii.290), though there seems to have been a land route passing through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anupiya')"&gt;Anupiya&lt;/a&gt; and Kosambí to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;. (See Vin.ii.184f). In the Sutta Nipáta (vv.1010-13) the whole route is given from&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maahissati')"&gt;Mahissati&lt;/a&gt; to Rájagaha, passing through Kosambí, the halting-places mentioned being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambí, Sáketa, Sávatthi, Setavyá, Kapilavatthu, Kusinárá, Pává, Bhoganagara and Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Near Kosambí, by the river, was Udena's park, the Udakavana, where Ananda and Pindola-Bháradvája preached to the women of Udena's palace on two different occasions (Vin.ii.290f; SNA.ii.514; J.iv.375). The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Simsapávana in Kosambí (S.v.437). Mahá Kaccána lived in a woodland near Kosambí after the holding of the First Council (PvA.141).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already in the Buddha's time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambí - the Kukkutáráma, the Ghositáráma, the Pávárika-ambavana (these being given by three of the most eminent citizens of Kosambí, named respectively, Kukkuta, Ghosita and Pávárika), and the Badarikáráma. The Buddha visited Kosambí on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books. (Thomas, op. cit., 115, n.2, doubts the authenticity of the stories connected with the Buddha's visits to Kosambí, holding that these stories are of later invention).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent his ninth rainy season at Kosambí, and it was on his way there on this occasion that he made a detour to Kammássadamma and was offered in marriage Mágandiyá, daughter of the brahmin Mágandiya. The circumstances are narrated in connection with the Mágandiya Sutta. Mágandiyá took the Buddha's refusal as an insult to herself, and, after her marriage to King Udena, tried in various ways to take revenge on the Buddha, and also on Udena's wife Sámavatí, who had been the Buddha's follower. (DhA.i.199ff; iii.193ff; iv.1ff; Ud.vii.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great schism once arose among the monks in Kosambí. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be </data>
<data>dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambí, becoming angry at the monks' behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Díghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambí and, journeying through Bálakalonakáragáma and the Pácínavamsadaya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Párileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambí, and, coming to the Buddha at Sávatthi, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. (Vin.i.337-57; J.iii.486ff (cp.iii.211ff); DhA.i.44ff; SA.ii.222f; the story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in Ud.iv.5. and in S.iii.94, but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambí uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics. But see UdA.248f, and SA.ii.222f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries give two reasons for the name Kosambí. The more favoured is (E.g., UdA.248; SNA.300; MA.i.535. Epic tradition ascribes the foundation of Kosambí to a Cedi prince, while the origin of the Vatsa people is traced to a king of Kásí, see PHAI.83, 84) that the city was so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once </data>
<data>occupied by the sage Kusumba (v.l. Kusumbha). Another explanation is (e.g., MA i.539; PsA.413) that large and stately margossa-trees (Kosammarukkhá) grew in great numbers in and around the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakkula was the son of a banker in Kosambí. (MA.ii.929; AA.i.170). In the Buddha's time there lived near the ferry at Kosambí a powerful Nága-king, the reincarnation of a former ship's captain. The Nága was converted by Ságata, who thereby won great fame. (AA.i.179; but see J.i.360, where the incident is given as happening at Bhaddavatiká). Rujá was born in a banker's family in Kosambí (J.vi.237f). Citta-pandita was also born there (J.iv.392). A king, by name Kosambaka (q.v.), once ruled there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesáli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kákandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambí, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres (Vin.ii.298; Mhv.iv.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at Kosambí that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks (Vin.ii.307).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosambí is mentioned in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.iv.179; but see AA.i.170; MA.ii.929; PsA.491, all of which indicate that the city was on the Yamuná) as being &quot;Gangáya nadiyá tíre.&quot; This is either an error, or here the name Gangá refers not to the Ganges but to the Yamuní. Kosambí is identified with the two villages of Kosam on the Jumna, about ninety miles west of Allahabad. (CAGI.448f; Vincent Smith places it further south, J.R.A.S.1898, 503ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Meghiya Thera was attracted by a mango-grove on its banks and asked the Buddha's permission to meditate there. Twice the Buddha refused; the third time he gave his permission. Meghiya went, but soon returned, finding that he could not concentrate his mind there. The river was evidently in the neighbourhood of Cáliká (A.iv.354f; ThagA.i.149; Ud.iv.1). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Udána Commentary (UdA.217), it was so called because it abounded in black worms (kálakimínam bahulatáya).v.l.

The Bodhisatta, having been born as Kappa, a brahmin of Kásí, joined him and became his senior pupil. When the ascetics went to Benares for salt and vinegar, the king lodged them in his park and fed them, and when they returned to Himavá, persuaded Kesava to stay behind. Kesava fell ill of loneliness, and the five physicians of the king could not cure him. At his own request he was taken to the Himálaya by the king's minister, Nárada, and there, on seeing again his familiar haunts and his pupil Kappa, he immediately recovered, though his medicine was but the broth of wild rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king of the Játaka is Ananda, Nárada is Sáriputta, and Kesava, Baka Brahmá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Pasenadi. Having discovered that Anáthapindika daily fed five hundred monks in his house, the king gave orders that the same should be done in his palace. One day he discovered that the monks would take the food from the palace, but would eat that which was given to them elsewhere by those who served them because they loved them. When the king reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha pointed out to him that the best food was that which was given in love; love was the best flavouring for food (J.iii.142-5; iii.362; S.i.144; SA.i.165).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.342ff), the king personally looked after the monks for seven days, after which he forgot about them and they were uncared for. Thereupon they omitted to go to the palace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the past as given in this Commentary differs considerably from the Játaka-version. Here Kesava is described as a king who had left the world and become an ascetic. The ascetics </data>
<data>left the royal park, disliking the noise there, but they left Kappa with Kesava. Soon after, Kappa went away, and it was then that Kesava fell ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kesava is identified with the Bodhisatta, Kappa with Ananda, the king of Benares with Moggallána, and Nárada with Sáriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was this reluctance of the Sákyan monks to accept Pasenadi's hospitality which led him to seek marriage with a Sákyan maiden; but the Sákyans gave him Vásabhakhattiyá (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A son was born to him who was named Dutthakumára, and who, according to the fortune-tellers, would die for lack of water. In order to falsify the prophecy, the king guarded his son closely, made numerous tanks near the city, and saw that vessels of water were placed wherever possible. One day, while returning from the park, the prince saw a Pacceka Buddha, and being angry that obeisance should be paid to the Buddha instead of to himself, he took the Buddha's bowl and dashed it on the ground. The prince's body burst into flames, but all the water around having dried up, they could not be quenched and he was swallowed up in hell. When Kitavása heard of this he was greatly grieved, but on reflection he realised that his grief sprang from affection, and thenceforth resolved to fix his love on nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitavása is identified with Chattapáni of the Dhammaddhaja Játaka, Chattapáni himself being a former birth of Sáriputta (J.ii.194ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Kitavása's son bears close resemblance to that of Kitava's son (see Kundinagariya Thera).

The king of the Phussakokilas, Punnamukha, on the other hand, always sang the praises of his escort. One day the two kings met, and Punnamukha asked Kunála why he was not more gracious to his ladies. &quot;Because I know too much about women,&quot; was the answer; but Punnamakha was not in a mood to discuss the matter any more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Punnamukha fell ill, and his hen birds deserted him and came to Kunála. He drove them away, ministered to Punnamukha, and cheered him. Some time after, Kunála, seated on the Manosilátala in Himavá (according to Buddhaghosa, D.ii.675, this was on the banks of the Kunáladaha), started to tell his friend of the wickedness of women. Hearing of this, many inhabitants of numerous worlds came to listen to him, among them Ananda, king of the vultures, and the ascetic Nárada. Many were the instances given by Kunála to illustrate the deceitfulness, ingratitude and immorality of women - among them the stories of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kanhaa')"&gt;Kanhá&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Saccatapáví&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaakaatii_jat_327')"&gt;Kákátí&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="kurangavii')"&gt;Kurangaví&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pingiyani')"&gt;Pingiyání&lt;/a&gt;, Brahmadatta's mother who sinned with   Pañcálacanda&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the queen Kinnará&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancapapa')"&gt;Pañcapápá&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kunála's diatribe was followed by Ananda's, and his by Nárada's, each claiming to speak from facts within their </data>
<data>knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the stories related by Kunála, the bird-king is identified with one of the characters concerned in each story, so that he was able to speak with authority. Thus he was &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ajjuna, one of Kanha's husbands;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the goldsmith in the story of   Saccatapáví; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the Garuda in Kákátí's tale;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Chalangakumára, who misconducted   himself with Kurangaví; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pañcálacanda, lover of Brahmadatta's   mother; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the chaplain, also called Pañcálacanda,   who saved Kinnará from her husband's wrath; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Baka, one time husband of Pañcapápá;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;and Brahmadatta, husband of Pingiyání.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punnamukha is identified with Udáyí, the vulture-king with Ananda and Nárada with Sáriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preaching of the Kunála Játaka was followed by that of the Mahásamaya Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Játaka was related in order to destroy the discontent that rose in the hearts of the Sákiyan youths, kinsmen of the Buddha, who, having entered the Order, were troubled by the thought of the wives they had left behind. The Buddha therefore took them to the Himalaya, showed them the magnificent beauty of the region, particularly the miraculous splendours of the Kunáladaha, and there preached to them. At the end of the Játaka they all became arahants. We are told that that very day they became arahants (J.v.412-56; also DA.ii.674ff; AA.i.173).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_kunaala_jat_464')"&gt;Cúla Kunála Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kosala&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country inhabited by the Kosalá, to the north-west of Magadha and next to Kásí. It is mentioned second in the list of sixteen Mahájanapadas (E.g., A.i.213; iv.252, etc.). In the Buddha's time it was a powerful kingdom ruled over by Pasenadi, who was succeeded by his son Vidúdabha. By this time Kásí was under the subjection of Kosala, for we find that when Bimbisára, king of Magadha, married Kosaladeví, daughter of Mahákosala and sister of Pasenadi, a village in Kásí was given as part of the dowry (J.ii.237; iv.342f). Various Játakas indicate that the struggle between Kási and Kosala had been very prolonged (See, e.g., J.ii.21f; iii.115f; 211f; v.316, 425). Sometimes the Kási king would attack Kosala, capture the king and rule over the country. At others the Kosala king would invade Kási and annex it to his own territory. Several Kosala kings who succeeded in doing this, are mentioned by name - e.g., Dabbasena (J.iii.13), Díghávu (J.iii.211f), Vanka (J.iii.168) and Kamsa; the last being given the special title of &quot;Báranásiggáha,&quot; (J.ii.403; v.112) probably in recognition of the fact that he completed the conquest of Kási. Other kings of Kosala who came in conflict with Benares in one way or another are mentioned - e.g., Díghiti (J.iii.211f; Vin.i.342f), Mallika (J.ii.3), and Chatta (J.iii.116). Sometimes the kings of the two countries entered into matrimonial alliances (e.g., J.iii.407). With the capture of Kási the power of Kosala increased rapidly, until a struggle between this country and Magadha became inevitable. Bimbisára's marriage was probably a political alliance, but it only served to postpone the evil day. Quite soon after his death there were many fierce fights between Ajátasattu, his successor, and Pasenadi, these fights bringing varying fortunes to the combatants. Once </data>
<data>Ajátasattu was captured alive, but Pasenadi spared his life and gave him his daughter, Vajirá, in marriage and for a time all went well. Later, however, after his conquest of the Licchavis, Ajátasattu seems to have succeeded in establishing his sway in Kosala. (See Vincent Smith, op. cit., 32f). In the sixth century B.C. the Sákyan territory of Kapilavatthu was subject to Kosala. The Sutta Nipáta (vs.405) speaks of the Buddha's birthplace as belonging to the Kosalans; see also A.i.276, where Kapilavatthu is mentioned as being in Kosala. Elsewhere (M.ii.124) Pasenadi is reported as saying, &quot;Bhagavá pi Kosalako, aham pi Kosalako.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Buddha Sávatthi was the capital of Kosala. Next in importance was Saketa, which, in ancient days, had sometimes been the capital (J.iii.270; Mtu.i.348). There was also Ayojjhá, on the banks of the Sarayu, which, judging from the Rámáyana, must once have been the chief city; but in the sixth century B.C. it was quite unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river Sarayu divided Kosala into two parts, Uttara Kosala and Dakkhina Kosala (Law: Geog., p.6). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Kosala rivers mentioned in the books are the Aciravatí (D.i.235) and the Sundariká (S.i.167; SN. p.97; but see M.i.39, where the river is called Báhuká). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among localities spoken of as being in Kosala are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Icchánangala (A.iii.30, 341; iv.340,   etc.), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ukkatthá (D.i.87), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ekasálá (S.i.111), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Opasáda (M.ii.164), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kesaputta of the Kálámas (A.i.188),  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Candalakappa (M.ii.209), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Toranavatthu (S.iv.374), &lt;/li&gt;</data>

It is said that when nothing could make Mahápanáda smile, his father offered a big reward for anyone who could succeed in doing this. People, accordingly, left their work and flocked to the court, but it, was not until Sakka sent down a celestial actor that Mahápanáda showed any signs of being amused. When this happened the men returned to their various duties, and on their way home, when meeting their friends, they asked of each other, &quot;Kacci bho kusalam, kacci bho kusalam.&quot; The district where this occurred came to be called Kosalá on account of the repetition of the word kusala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent the greater part of his time in Kosala, either in Sávatthi or in touring in the various parts of the country, and many of the Vinaya rules were formulated in Kosala. (See Vinaya Index, s.v. Kosala). It is said (SA.i.221) that alms were plentiful in Kosala, though, evidently (J.i.329), famines, due to drought, were not unknown. Yet, though woodland tracts were numerous (see, e.g., SA.i.225) where monks could </data>
<data>meditate in solitude, the number of monks actually found in Kosala was not large (VT.i.226). Bávarí himself was a native of Kosala (SN.v.976), yet he preferred to have his hermitage in Dakkhinápatha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, his unnaloma was deposited in a thúpa in Kosala (Bu.xxviii.9). It is said that the measures used in Kosala were larger than those of Magadha - thus one Kosala pattha was equal to four Magadha patthas (SNA.ii.476).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosala is often mentioned in combination with Kási in the compound Kási-Kosala; Pasenadi was king of Kási-Kosala (e.g., A.v.59) (cf. Ariga-Magadha). See also Pasenadi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kosala&lt;/b&gt;.-A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned in a list of names. M.iii.70; ApA.i.107.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kujjatissa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He lived in Mangana in Ceylon, and was mentioned by the Sangha to King Saddhátissa as being worthy of his special worship. The king travelled five leagues to see him, but the thera, lest the king should invite him to the palace, lay down on a bed at the time of the king's arrival and started scratching letters on the floor. The king decided that the thera was not an arahant and went away. When he was blamed for having displeased so pious a king, the thera undertook to make amends. He requested that, after his death, he should be placed in a covered palanquin containing also a second bed. This was done and the palanquin travelled by air to Anurádhapura, performing many miracles, applauded by the people. In Anurádhapura it circled round the Thúpáráma and the Silácetiya and, when it reached the Lohapásáda, the thera Mahávyaggha entered the palanquin, lay down on the spare bed and entered Nibbána. The king made offerings of flowers and perfumes to the palanquin and it descended to earth, for such had been Kujjatissa's desire. The bodies were burnt and thúpas were erected over the relics. AA.i.384f. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Khuddaka-Tissa (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Bodhisatta, who became Mangala Buddha in one of his later births, left his kingdom and lived as a recluse in the forest with his wife and children. The yakkha, having heard of the Bodhisatta's generosity, came to him, begged for his two children, and on being given them ate them in the sight of their father. Even when the blood flowed from the yakkha's mouth the Bodhisatta remained unmoved, and wished that in the future there should issue from his own body rays of light, in colour like to streams of blood. As a result of this wish Mangala's aura always spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, while that of other Buddhas spread as a rule only one fathom from their body.

The Bodhisatta sent him some food, but Mára created a pit of glowing khadira-embers between the Pacceka Buddha and the Treasurer's house. When the Treasurer heard of this, he took the bowl of food himself and stepped into the pit, ready to die rather than to have his alms-giving thwarted. A lotus sprang up to receive his foot, the pit vanished, and Mára, discomfited, vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaathapindika')"&gt;Anáthapindika&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A devatá, who lived in the upper storey of his palace, had to come with her children down to the ground floor whenever the Buddha visited Anáthapindika. She tried to check the merchant's munificence by talking to his manager and his eldest son, but all in vain. At last, when as a result of his extreme piety Anáthapindika's wealth was exhausted, the devatá ventured to approach him and warn him of his impending ruin if he did not take heed. He ordered her out of the house, and she had, perforce, to obey. In despair she sought the aid of Sakka, who suggested that she should recover for the merchant all his debts, and reveal to him his hidden treasure which had been lost sight of. She did so, but Anáthapindika, before consenting to pardon her, took her to the Buddha, who then related this Játaka. The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/velaama_sutta')"&gt;Velámaka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; was also preached on this occasion (J.i.226-34; see also the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visayha_jat_340')"&gt;Visayha Játaka&lt;/a&gt;).

One day, while sitting on a flat stone, he entered into a trance. A pack of thieves, mistaking him for the trunk of a tree, piled their sacks on to his head and body and slept around him. In the morning, discovering their mistake, they begged forgiveness and, having listened to his preaching, became monks. It was this incident which gained for him the name of Khánu (&quot;stump&quot;). The Buddha praised him on account of his achievement (DhA.ii.254f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khánu Kondañña's samádhi is classified under vipphárá iddhi, inasmuch as even the uproar, caused by the thieves in piling up their sacks, did not disturb it.

He ate the Nága's fat seated on a kotisimbali-tree, and threw away the banyan and the Nága's carcase. A bird who was in the banyan-tree left it and took up his abode in the simbali. The Bodhisatta, who was a tree-sprite in the simbali, trembled at the sight of the tiny bird, because the sprite knew that from the bird's droppings huge trees would spring up and kill the simbali. The Garuda, seeing the sprite trembling, asked the reason, and on learning it frightened the bird away. It is right to distrust where distrust is proper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to five hundred monks who were in danger of being overcome by sinful desires (J.iii.397ff).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kosambí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of the Vatsas or Vamsas (J.iv.28; vi.236). In the time of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;. (MA.ii.740f; DhA.i.164f). Kosambí was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha's Parinibbána (D.ii.146,169). It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to &lt;a href="kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt; from the south and the west. (See, e.g., Vin.i.277). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city was thirty leagues by river from Benares. (Thus we are told that the fish which swallowed &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakkula')"&gt;Bakkula&lt;/a&gt; travelled thirty leagues through the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamunaa')"&gt;Yamuná&lt;/a&gt;, from Kosambí to Benares, AA.i.170; PsA.491). The usual route from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; to Kosambí was up the river (this was the route taken by Ananda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt;, Vin.ii.290), though there seems to have been a land route passing through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anupiya')"&gt;Anupiya&lt;/a&gt; and Kosambí to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;. (See Vin.ii.184f). In the Sutta Nipáta (vv.1010-13) the whole route is given from&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maahissati')"&gt;Mahissati&lt;/a&gt; to Rájagaha, passing through Kosambí, the halting-places mentioned being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambí, Sáketa, Sávatthi, Setavyá, Kapilavatthu, Kusinárá, Pává, Bhoganagara and Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Near Kosambí, by the river, was Udena's park, the Udakavana, where Ananda and Pindola-Bháradvája preached to the women of Udena's palace on two different occasions (Vin.ii.290f; SNA.ii.514; J.iv.375). The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Simsapávana in Kosambí (S.v.437). Mahá Kaccána lived in a woodland near Kosambí after the holding of the First Council (PvA.141).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already in the Buddha's time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambí - the Kukkutáráma, the Ghositáráma, the Pávárika-ambavana (these being given by three of the most eminent citizens of Kosambí, named respectively, Kukkuta, Ghosita and Pávárika), and the Badarikáráma. The Buddha visited Kosambí on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books. (Thomas, op. cit., 115, n.2, doubts the authenticity of the stories connected with the Buddha's visits to Kosambí, holding that these stories are of later invention).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent his ninth rainy season at Kosambí, and it was on his way there on this occasion that he made a detour to Kammássadamma and was offered in marriage Mágandiyá, daughter of the brahmin Mágandiya. The circumstances are narrated in connection with the Mágandiya Sutta. Mágandiyá took the Buddha's refusal as an insult to herself, and, after her marriage to King Udena, tried in various ways to take revenge on the Buddha, and also on Udena's wife Sámavatí, who had been the Buddha's follower. (DhA.i.199ff; iii.193ff; iv.1ff; Ud.vii.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great schism once arose among the monks in Kosambí. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be </data>
<data>dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambí, becoming angry at the monks' behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Díghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambí and, journeying through Bálakalonakáragáma and the Pácínavamsadaya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Párileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambí, and, coming to the Buddha at Sávatthi, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. (Vin.i.337-57; J.iii.486ff (cp.iii.211ff); DhA.i.44ff; SA.ii.222f; the story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in Ud.iv.5. and in S.iii.94, but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambí uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics. But see UdA.248f, and SA.ii.222f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries give two reasons for the name Kosambí. The more favoured is (E.g., UdA.248; SNA.300; MA.i.535. Epic tradition ascribes the foundation of Kosambí to a Cedi prince, while the origin of the Vatsa people is traced to a king of Kásí, see PHAI.83, 84) that the city was so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once </data>
<data>occupied by the sage Kusumba (v.l. Kusumbha). Another explanation is (e.g., MA i.539; PsA.413) that large and stately margossa-trees (Kosammarukkhá) grew in great numbers in and around the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakkula was the son of a banker in Kosambí. (MA.ii.929; AA.i.170). In the Buddha's time there lived near the ferry at Kosambí a powerful Nága-king, the reincarnation of a former ship's captain. The Nága was converted by Ságata, who thereby won great fame. (AA.i.179; but see J.i.360, where the incident is given as happening at Bhaddavatiká). Rujá was born in a banker's family in Kosambí (J.vi.237f). Citta-pandita was also born there (J.iv.392). A king, by name Kosambaka (q.v.), once ruled there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesáli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kákandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambí, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres (Vin.ii.298; Mhv.iv.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at Kosambí that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks (Vin.ii.307).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosambí is mentioned in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.iv.179; but see AA.i.170; MA.ii.929; PsA.491, all of which indicate that the city was on the Yamuná) as being &quot;Gangáya nadiyá tíre.&quot; This is either an error, or here the name Gangá refers not to the Ganges but to the Yamuní. Kosambí is identified with the two villages of Kosam on the Jumna, about ninety miles west of Allahabad. (CAGI.448f; Vincent Smith places it further south, J.R.A.S.1898, 503ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He bellowed like a dog, walked on all fours, and licked up food with his mouth only. Sunakkhatta saw him and greatly admired him, but the Buddha prophesied that Korakkhatta would, in seven days, die of epilepsy and be born among the Kálakañjakas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prophecy proved true, and Sunakkhatta learnt the truth from Korakkhatta's corpse (D.iii.6ff; J.i.389f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.819) that Korakkhattiya was so called because his feet turned inwards (anto vankapádo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kurungamiga Játaka (No.21).-&lt;/b&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was an antelope who used to eat the fruit of a sepanni-tree. One day a huntsman discovered him and lay in wait to kill him, but the Bodhisatta suspected his presence and so escaped death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta's&lt;/a&gt; plots to kill the Buddha, the huntsman being identified with Devadatta. J.i.173f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kurungamiga Játaka (No.206).&lt;/b&gt;-In a forest lived three friends: an antelope, a woodpecker and a tortoise. One night the antelope was caught in a huntsman's noose, and the tortoise set about biting through the thongs of the noose while the woodpecker, uttering cries of ill-omen, kept the huntsman in his hut. The antelope escaped, but the tortoise, exhausted by his labours, was caught by the huntsman. The antelope thereupon enticed the hunter into the forest and, eluding him, released the tortoise. The antelope was the Bodhisatta, Sáriputta the woodpecker, Moggallána the tortoise and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; the hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's wickedness (J.ii.152ff; DhA.iii.152f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Játaka is figured on the Bharhut Stupa.

But he was often seized by fits of lustful passion, and even when, following the Buddha's instructions, he meditated in the charnel field, he could not control the tendency. The Buddha himself went with him and bade him mark the putrefaction and dissolution of dead bodies around him. He attained first jhána, developing which he won arahantship (ThagA.i.444f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá verses (393-8) ascribed to him are a record of this experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Having heard from some ascetics, whom they had entertained, of the appearance of the Buddha, they went with these ascetics to Sávatthi, each carrying offerings in five hundred carts. Having heard the Buddha preach, they became sotápannas. They gave alms to the Buddha for a fortnight, and then, with his permission, returned to Kosambí. They built monasteries in their gardens for the use of the Buddha and his monks, that built by Kukkuta being called the Kukkutáráma.

Kokálika (Kokáliya) Sutta (See Kokálika 2).-The story of Kokálika - according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.473), to be distinguished as Cúla Kokálika. It contains the verses preached by the Buddha to Kokálika. The verses describe the evil of back-biting and the terrors that await the back-biter after death. The Sutta Nipáta contains twenty-two verses (657-78). The Sutta Nipáta Commentary says (p.477f) that the last two stanzas are not explained in the Mahá Atthakathá, and that therefore they did not belong to the original sutta. Of the remaining twenty the last fourteen (663-76) are called by Buddhaghosa the Turitavatthugáthá, and he says that they were uttered by Moggallána as Kokálika lay dying, by way of admonition, and that, according to others, Mahá Brahma was the speaker. The first three stanzas (658-60) are, in the Samyutta Nikáya (i.149), attributed to Tudu. In the Anguttara Nikáya (v.171-4; the verses are also found in A.ii.3 and in S.i.149ff; Netti.132), also, Tudu speaks them; but according to this version the Buddha repeats them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kokálika Sutta.-Gives the story of Kokálika (2) speaking ill of Sáriputta and Moggallána before the Buddha, of Kokálika's illness and death, of his admonition by Tudu, and of the announcement of his death and subsequent birth in the Paduma-niraya by Sahampatí to the Buddha. A monk questions the Buddha on the duration of suffering in the Paduma-niraya, and the Buddha proceeds to instruct him by means of various illustrations. The sutta ends with the repetition by the Buddha of Tudu's verses. A.v.171-4; also S.i.149ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kokálika Sutta.-Subrahmá visits the Buddha at Sávatthi and utters verses in reference to Kokálika. The man who tries </data>

It is probably identical with Kolambálaka (Mhv.xxxiii.42), in which case it was near the Tittháráma, in the neighbourhood of the northern gate of Anurádhapura. There was also a monastery called Kolambahaláka founded by Súratissa, and said to have been near Raheraka (Mhv.xxi.5). The Kolambahálaka-parivena was the residence of the monk Dáthávedhaka.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Konágamana (Konágamana)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twenty-third in the list of the twenty-four Buddhas and the second Buddha to be born in the Bhaddakappa. He was born in the Subhagavatí Park in Sobhavatí, the capital of King Sobha, his father being the brahmin Yaññadatta and his mother Uttará. He lived in the household for three thousand years, in three palaces, Tusita, Santusita and Santuttha; his chief wife was Rucigattá and their son was Satthaváha. Konágamana left the world on an elephant and practised austerities only for six months, at the end of which time he was given milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Aggisoma and grass for his seat by the yavapálaka Tinduka. His Bodhi was an Udumbara tree. His first sermon was preached in the Migadáya near Sudassana-nagara, at the foot of a Mahá-sála tree. He held only one assembly of his disciples, who numbered thirty thousand. His body was thirty cubits in height. He died in the Pabbatáráma at the age of thirty thousand. His relics were scattered. His chief disciples were Bhíyya and Uttara among monks, and Samuddá and Uttará among nuns, his constant attendant being Sotthiya. His chief patrons were Ugga and Somadeva among laymen, and Sívalá and Sámá among laywomen. The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Pabbata of Mithilá. He held an almsgiving, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order. (D.i.7; Bu.xxiv; BuA.213ff; J.i.42f; according to the Játaka his body was twenty cubits high; Sp.i.190). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banker Ugga built for the Buddha a Sangháráma half a league in extent (J.i.94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the Buddha's birth a shower of gold fell all over Jambudípa, hence he was called Kanakágamana, Konágamana being a corrupt form of that word (BuA.213-14)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ceylon Chronicles (Dpv.ii.67; xv.25, 44, 48; xvii.9, 17, 73; Mhv.xv.91-124), Konágamana visited </data>
<data>their Island (then known as Varadípa), with thirty thousand disciples, accepted the Mahánoma garden at Vaddhamána, given by King Samiddha, and preached the doctrine. At the conclusion of his sermon, thirty thousand people realised the Truth. At the Buddha's wish, the nun Kantakánandá (v.l. Kanakadattá) brought to Ceylon a branch of the Bodhi-tree. The Buddha also preached at the Ratanamála, the Sudassanamála and the Nágamálaka and gave his girdle for the people's worship. He left Mahásumba and Kantakánandá to look after the new converts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Konágamana's time Mount Vepulla was known as Vankaka, and the people living on the mountain were called Rohitassá, their term of life being thirty thousand years (S.ii.191). Konágamana held the uposatha once a year (DhA.ii.236).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Northern books (E.g., Dvy.333; Mtu.i.114; ii.265f, 300, 302, 304, 430; iii.240-7, 330) Konágamana is called Kanakamuni, Konákamuni, and Kanakaparvata. A Thúpa, erected on the spot where Konágamana was born, is thought to have existed down to the time of Asoka, who rebuilt it to double its original size and worshipped it in his twentieth year (Hultszch: Inscrip. of Asoka, p.165). Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op. cit., ii.19) says he saw thúpas at Konágamana's birthplace and also at the spot where he met his father after the Enlightenment. Fa Hien (Travels, p.36) saw thúpas at the latter place and also at the place of the Buddha's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once during a drinking festival at Sávatthi five hundred women, friends of Visákhá visited Jetavana in her company. On the way they became drunk, which led to their behaving improperly in the monastery. The Buddha frightened them by his iddhi-power and restored them to their senses. (J.v.11ff; the DhA.iii.100ff gives a slightly different version of the doings of Visákhá's friends).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the past is also given in the Játakamálá (No.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was born in Vesáli, and was one of those who heard the Buddha preach when he came to quieten the panic which arose there, as recorded in the Ratana Sutta (q.v.). After the sermon Kosalavihárí left the world. At the conclusion of his novitiate he dwelt in a forest near a village in Kosala. A lay adherent seeing him camping under a tree built for him a small hut, and there the thera attained arahantship. He acquired his name from having dwelt long in Kosala (Thag.59; ThagA.i.134f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic in Himavá and gave the Buddha some tuberous roots. Fifty-four kappas ago he was a king named Sumekhalisama. He is evidently to be identified with Bilálidáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kosiya Játaka (No.130).&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin of Benares had a bad wife who lay in bed by day feigning sickness and spent her nights in enjoyment. The husband worked hard to supply her with dainties, and, in consequence, could not visit his teacher who was the Bodhisatta. When the latter discovered the truth, he advised the brahmin to prepare a mess of cow-dung and other things and to insist that his wife should either swallow this medicine or get up and work. She then knew that her shamming was discovered and abandoned her evil ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a brahmin of Sávatthi, a pious follower of the Buddha, whose wife behaved in a similar way. The Buddha told him this story of the past and asked him to try the same remedy, for, he said, the brahmin and his wife were identical with the couple of the story (J.i.463f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the atítavatthu the woman is addressed as &quot;Kosiyá.&quot; The scholiast (J.i.465) adds that she belonged to the Kosiyagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kosiya Játaka (No.226).&lt;/b&gt;-The king of Benares, making war at an unseasonable time while camping in the park, saw an owl (kosiya) being attacked by crows. The king asked his minister the reason for this; the minister, being the Bodhisatta, said the owl had left his hiding-place too early-that is, before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Pasenadi, who visited Jetavana on his way to quell a border rising; the time was unsuitable for such an enterprise.

In the present age it was called &lt;a href="kusinaaraa')"&gt;Kusinárá&lt;/a&gt;. Once it was the royal city of Mahá-Sudassana and was twelve leagues in length and twelve in breadth, prosperous and full of people, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalakamandaa')"&gt;Álakamandá&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.146f; J.i.392; Cyp.i.4; Dvy.227).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Khujjuttará&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was born of a nurse in the house of the banker Ghosita (AA.i.232), and later became a slave of Queen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samavati')"&gt;Sámávati&lt;/a&gt;. The queen gave her daily the eight pieces of money allowed to her by the king for the purchase of flowers. Khujjuttará bought flowers with four pieces from the gardener &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana')"&gt;Sumana&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining four pieces she kept. One day the Buddha visited Sumana, and Khujjuttará, having heard the Buddha preach to him, became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. That day she spent the whole amount on flowers. The queen asked her how she had obtained so many, and she told her the whole story. From that time Sámávatí showed Khujjuttará all honour, bathed her in perfumed water, and heard the Dhamma from her. Khujjuttará became, as it were, a mother to Sámávatí, and going regularly to hear the Dhamma, would return and preach it to her and her five hundred attendant women. Under the instruction of Khujjuttará they all became sotápannas. When Sámávatí expressed a desire to see the Buddha, Khujjuttará suggested that she should pierce holes in the walls of the palace and gaze on the Buddha as he passed along the street. After the death of Sámávatí, Khujjuttará seems to have spent all her time in religious works, listening to the preaching of the Dhamma. The Buddha declared her foremost among lay women by reason of her extensive knowledge (bahussutánam). A.i.26; DhA.i.208ff; AA.i.226, 237f; ItvA.23f.; PsA.498f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, in the past, she was a serving-woman of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, and one day, having seen a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacceka_buddha')"&gt;Pacceka Buddha&lt;/a&gt; who was slightly hunch-backed, she threw a blanket over her shoulder, and </data>
<data>bending down to look like a hunchback, she imitated the Buddha's manner of walking. Therefore, in this present birth she herself was hunchbacked. On another occasion eight Pacceka Buddhas, receiving their bowls filled with rice-porridge from the palace, found the bowls so hot that they were obliged to move them from one hand to the other. Seeing this, Khujjuttará gave them eight ivory bracelets as stands for their bowls. It is said that these bracelets are still preserved in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandamulapabbhara')"&gt;Nandamúla-pabbhára&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this act Khujjuttará obtained profound wisdom in this birth, and was able to learn the Tipitaka by heart. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was the daughter of a treasurer, and had a friend who was a nun; one day when she was adorning herself at eventide the nun visited her, and as there was no servant-girl at the time Khujjuttará asked the nun to do various things for her. As a result she was born as a slave. Her desire to become chief among learned lay-women was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, on her seeing a similar rank bestowed on a lay-woman (DhA.i.226f, etc.; Dvy.339-41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the discourses in the Itivuttaka are those which Khujjuttará learned from the Buddha and later repeated to Sámávatí and her attendant women. Because these discourses were all preached at Kosambí and repeated there by her, there was no need to specify the place of their preaching; hence the formula &quot;Ekam samayam Bhagavá Kosambiyam viharati&quot; is omitted, and instead is found &quot;vuttam h'etam Bhagavatá arahatá.&quot; (ItvA.32).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khujjuttará is several times mentioned as the paragon among lay-women disciples (E.g., A.i.88; ii.164; iv.368; S.ii.236), and in the Commentaries (E.g., DA.iii.910) she is given as an example of kámabhoginiyo (women who enjoyed the pleasures of </data>
<data>the senses). She possessed the patisambhidá while yet a householder, but it was the patisambhidá of the probationer (sekha) (Vsm.442; VibhA.388).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khujjuttará is identified with the slave-girl in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uraga_jat_154_354')"&gt;Uraga Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.168) and in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhisa_jat_488')"&gt;Bhisa Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.314), the nurse in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_sutasoma_jat_525')"&gt;Culla-Sutasoma Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.192) and the hunchback in the&lt;a href="kusa_jat_531')"&gt;Kusa Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.312). Owing to her personal experience (abhijánato) she had the power of recalling her past births (Mil.78).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (UdA.384) that when Sámávatí and her companions were burnt to death, Khujjuttará escaped because she had not participated in their previous misdeeds. At the time of the fire she was absent from the palace, some say ten leagues away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;a HREF="../../../index')"&gt;&lt;img SRC="../../images/pitsanu.gif" border="1" alt="Home" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#top"&gt;&lt;img SRC="../../images/uparrowb.gif" ALT="Oben" border="1" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/dic_idx')"&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/zeilen.gif" alt="Zum Index" border="1" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a HREF="mailto:gregerw@loxinfo.co.th"&gt;&lt;img SRC="../../images/mailbig.gif" border="1" alt="Email" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;img border="1" src="../../images/uparrow3.gif" alt="Zurueck" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;img SRC="../../images/dwnarrow.gif" border="1" alt="Voraus" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Khantivanna Játaka (No.225)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A courtier of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, started an intrigue in the king's harem, and a servant of the courtier did likewise in his master's house. When the courtier brought the servant to the king, the king advised the master to be patient, as good servants were rare, and, said the king, he knew of a courtier who had acted in the same way, but his king did not wish to lose him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to the king of Kosala, who had been made a cuckold by one of his young and zealous courtiers.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Korandaka Vihára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Ceylon. The Visuddhi Magga (p.91) contains the story of a young monk, nephew of the Elder of the Vihára, who went to Rohana for study; he later returned to the Vihára, and for three months was waited on by his parents, but he did not reveal his identity, fearing that his parents would prove an impediment to him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This monastery was once the residence of an Elder named Mahá Sangharakkhita. v.l. Corakandaka. MT.606.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kútadanta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Khánumata. Kútadanta consults the Buddha on the best way of making a sacrifice efficacious, and the Buddha tells him of a sacrifice held in days of yore by King Mahá Vijitáví, under the guidance of his enlightened purohita. The sacrifice is undertaken with the co-operation of the four divisions of the king's subjects. The king has eight personal qualifications, as has his chaplain. No living thing is injured; all the labour is voluntary and the sacrifice is offered, not only on behalf of the king, but of all the good. No regrets are felt at any stage of the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha then proceeds to tell Kútadanta of other forms of &quot;sacrifice&quot; more potent than the gift of material things, and ends the sutta with a description of arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the discourse Kútadanta declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha. D.i.127ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

To this Compendium there exists a Sinhalese paraphrase of the eleventh century, and based on the Compendium is one Porána-tíká by Revata and another by Sangharakkhita.

Like the peak of a roof which falls unless tightly held by the rafters, is a king who must be supported by his subjects who have been won over by his righteousness. As a citron must be eaten without its peel, so must taxes be gathered without violence. Like the lotus, unstained by the water in which it grows, is the virtuous man untainted by the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king is identified with Ananda (J.iii.317ff). The occasion for the story is given in the Tesakuna Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

J.i.34; but in Bu.v.21 it is called Mekhala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-The city in which Tissa Buddha was born. J.i.40. In Bu.xviii.16 it is called Khemaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Khema.&lt;/b&gt;-The city in which Kakusandha Buddha was born (J.i.42; Bu.xxiii.13 calls it Khemavatí). It was the capital of King Khemankara. See also No.6 below. See also Dvy.242.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-A Khattiya, the Bodhisatta in the time of Kakusandha Buddha. He gave alms to the Buddha and the monks and entertained the Order (D.ii.7; J.i.42; Bu.xxiii.13; BuA.211). He helped Rúpanandá to bring a branch of Kakusandha's bodhi-tree to Ceylon. See also Khemankara. Mhv.xv.79; MT.351.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-The deer-park near Bandhumatí (J.vi.480; Bu.xx.4; AA.i.80, 169). There the Buddha Vipassí was born, and there he preached his first sermon to his chief disciples, and later another sermon to their eighty-four thousand followers (BuA.196f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Khema is identical with the present Isipatana. DA.ii.471.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-The pleasance in which Kakusandha Buddha died (Bu.xxiii.27). It was near Khemavatí and was the birthplace of Kakusandha. BuA.209.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Khema.&lt;/b&gt;-A pleasance near Usabhavatí; there the Buddha Vessabhú died.

It was constructed by King Seyya (v.l. Samyama). For details see the Maháhamsa Játaka. J.v.356; J.iv.424.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-A setthiputta, nephew of Anáthapindika. He was very handsome and beloved of all women. Several times he was brought before the king on charges of adultery, but the king pardoned him out of regard for Anáthapindika. At the latter's request, the Buddha preached to Khema and showed him the error of his ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a champion wrestler, and planted two coloured banners on the golden shrine of the Buddha and made a wish that all women, except his own kinswomen, should fall in love with him at sight. DhA.iii.481f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-A devaputta who visited the Buddha at Jetavana and spoke several verses on the desirability of leading the good life. S.i.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Khema Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant. See &lt;a href="khema_s')"&gt;Khema Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (2). A.iii.358.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk of Ceylon, pupil of Dhammapálita of Rohana. He was well versed in the Tipitaká (&quot;tipetakí&quot;), and is mentioned among those who handed down the teaching of the Buddha in Ceylon in pupillary succession. Vin.v.3; Smp.i.63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="13"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;.

In the time of Atthadassí he was a rakkhasa in a lake near Himavá and gave the Buddha a garland of flowers. Fifteen kappas ago he was king seven times under the name of Sahassaratha (Ap.i.186f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kumudamáliya Thera.-An arahant. In the past he saw Vipassí Buddha walking in the street and gave him a garland of kumuda-flowers (Ap.i.257f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kimsukopama Játaka (No.248)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four monks came to the Buddha and asked him for a topic of meditation. He gave them various topics and they, having retired to various places, all became arahants: one by understanding the six-fold sphere, the second the five khandhas, the third the four mahábhútas, and the fourth the eighteen dhátu. They returned and related to the Buddha each the particular excellence attained by him, and one of them asked the Buddha how all these methods could lead to Nibbána. The Buddha related a story of the past where four sons of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, having asked their charioteer to show them a kimsuka-tree, are shown the tree at four different times: when the buds were just sprouting, when the leaves were green, at the time of blossoming, and at the time of fruit-bearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked to describe the tree, the first likened it to a burnt stump, the second to a banyan tree, the third to a piece of meat, and the fourth to an acacia. The matter was referred to the king, who solved the difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king was the Bodhisatta. J.ii.265f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Khandasumana Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He was born in Pává in the family of a Malla chieftain, and was called Khandasumana because, on his birthday, molasses and jasmine appeared in his house. Having heard the Buddha preaches in Cunda's mango-grove at Pává, he entered the Order and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he had built a railing of sandalwood round the thúpa of Padumuttara Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was unable to get any flowers, the king having bought them all for his offerings; he therefore bought a khandasumana-flower at a great price and offered it at the thúpa of the Buddha (Thag.96; ThagA.i.198).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Sapariváriya Thera of the Apadána (Ap.i.172). His Apadána-verses are almost the same as those attributed to Nandiya Thera.

He had entered the Order through fear of the infamous Anulá, but later he led an army against her and slew her. He founded the Pelagáma-vihára, built the Vannaka canal, and laid out the Padumassara park. He founded, for his mother, a nunnery called the Dantageha. He had also constructed a wall, seven cubits high, round Anurádhapura. Bhátikábhaya was his son and successor (Mhv.xxxiv.28ff). The Dípavamsa (Dpv.xviii.37; but see xx.31, where he is called Tissa and his son Nága) appears to call him Kutikanna-Abhaya, and speaks of him as a very devoted supporter of the nuns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kutakanna had a horse of the Ájáníya race called Gulavanna (SA.i.27; MA.ii.654).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two theras are mentioned in the Vibhanga Commentary (VibhA.452) as having been held in special esteem by the king - Cúlasudhamma Thera of Girigámakanna and Tipitaka-Cúlanága Thera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A novice living there was in the habit of getting two ladles of rice at the house of a Lambakanna in the district. It was a time of scarcity, and one day, seeing a guest in the house, he took only one ladleful. The Lambakanna was greatly pleased, and when he reported the matter to his friends and acquaintances, they gave the novice sixty meals in perpetuity. AA.ii.262.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Hard by was a mukkhaka-tree in which lived a Tree-sprite. One day the king's carpenter, looking for a suitable pillar for the king's one-pillared palace, reluctantly decided to fell the mukkhaka. Learning of the Tree-sprite's imminent danger, the Bodhisatta assumed the shape of a chameleon and deceived the carpenter in such a way that he saw the mukkhaka as all rotten and of no use for his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to one of Anáthapindika's friends. He was of low rank and poor, and Anáthapindika's other friends protested against such intimacy. But one day the poor friend saved Anáthapindika's house from being burgled. The Buddha related the story to show how each, according to his strength, could help a friend in need (J.i.441ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the Tree-sprite. The story is often quoted (E.g., J.iv.77) to show the value of a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

They helped Devadatta in his attempt to cause a rift in the Sangha (Vin.ii.196; iii.171). Khandadeviyáputta defended Devadatta when others blamed him (Vin.iii.174) and was held in great esteem by Thullanandá (Vin.iii.66; iv.335). The Khuddakapátha Commentary (KhpA.126) mentions him in a list of wicked persons, together with those mentioned above, Ciñcamánaviká, and the brother of Díghavidassa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He came of a brahmin family of Sávatthi and entered the Order, but from want of mental balance he could not concentrate his thoughts. Then, one day, while begging for alms, he saw how men conducted water whither they wished by digging channels, how the fletcher fixed the arrow shaft in his lathe surveying it from the corner of his eye, how the chariot-makers planed axle and tire and hub. Dwelling on these things, he soon attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he was a park-keeper, and gave a coconut to the Buddha Vipassí, which the Buddha accepted while travelling through the air (ThagA.i.71f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he is to be identified with Nálikeradáyaka Thera of the Apadána (ii.447f). The same Apadána-verses, however, are also ascribed to Khitaka Thera (ThagA.i.315f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verse attributed to Kundala in the Theragáthá (Thag.19) occurs twice in the Dhammapada, and is in the Dhammapada Commentary mentioned as having been preached once in reference to Pandita-Sámanera (DhA.ii.147), and once in reference to Sukha-Sámanera (DhA.iii.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha preached his first sermon to Khanda and his friend Tissa, the chaplain's son, in the Deer Park at Khema. Later, Khanda became the Buddha's chief disciple Ekasaññaka (BuA.196; AA.i.80; DA.ii.416; see also 457), in a previous birth, once gave alms to Khanda. Ap.i.121.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Khanda&lt;/b&gt;.-Name of a god, the Pali equivalent of the Sanskrit Skanda, mentioned with Siva in the Udána Commentary.

Khila Sutta.-Fallowness of heart arises from doubt in the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, and the way of training (sikkhá), and from anger against one's fellow-celibates. A.iii.248; iv.460; D.iii.237; M.i.101; Vibh.377, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kelása&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kelása.-A mountain range in Himavá. It is one of the five ranges which stand round Anotatta and is of silver colour, two hundred leagues high, bent inwards &quot;like a crow's beak.&quot; (SNA.ii.437f; MA.ii.585; UdA.300; AA.ii.759). It is sixty leagues in breadth, and Álavaka, on his way to his house, having heard to his great anger that the Buddha was there, placed his left foot on Manosilátala and his right on Kelásakúta. The touch of his foot sent pieces of the rock flying, and his shout &quot;I am Álavaka&quot; was heard throughout Jambudípa (SNA.i.223; SA.i.248).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelása is often used in similes to describe an object that is perfectly white (E.g., J.iv.232; vi.490, 515; the horse Kanthaka, Mbv.26; DhA.i.192; Cv.lxxiii.114), very stately (E.g., an elephant's head or a big building, J.i.321; v.52, 53; Cv.lxxviii.77), or difficult to destroy (E.g., J.v.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahávastu (ii.97, 109; see also iii.309, 438), Kailása is mentioned as the abode of the Kinnaras. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sanskrit mythology, Kailása is given as the abode of the gods, chiefly Siva and Kubera. See, e.g., Epic Mythology passim and Ved. Ind. s.v. The mountain range has been identified as belonging to the trans-Himálayan system and consisting of a group of mountains over twenty thousand feet in height (see Cv.Trs.i.280, n.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kelása.-A vihára in Ceylon, probably in the district of Malagana. At one time sixty thousand monks dwelt there with Khuddatissa at their head (M.xxxii.53). This is probably not the Kelása vihára (in Jambudípa?) whence, we are told, Suriyagotta came with ninety thousand monks to the foundation of the Mahá Thúpa.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kikí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Benares at the time of the Buddha Kassapa. When the Buddha arrived in Benares, the king, having listened to his sermon, entertained the Buddha and his monks at the palace. When the Buddha was asked to spend the rainy season there he refused, as he had already accepted the invitation of Ghatíkára of Vehalinga. Kikí was at first hurt by the refusal, but when the Buddha described Ghatíkára's virtues, the king was pleased and sent five hundred cartloads of provisions to Ghatíkára who, however, curtly refused the gift (D.ii.7; M.ii.49ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Kikí's daughters was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uracchadaa')"&gt;Uracchadá&lt;/a&gt;, who attained arahantship at the age of sixteen. He had seven other daughters - Samaní, Samaná, Guttá, Bhikkhudásiká, Dhammá, Sudhammá and Sanghadásí - who, in this Buddha-age became respectively Khemá, Uppalavanná, Patácárá, Gotamá, Dhammadinná, Mahámáyá and Visákhá. J.iv.481; in the Ap.ii.561f, the names are Samaní, Samapaguttá, Bhikkhuní, Bhikkhadáyiká, Dhammá, etc., and they are mentioned as having lived celibate lives; see also Sattamba; both the Apadána and the ThigA.17, 103f, omit the name of Mahámáyá from this list and have, instead, the name of Bhaddá Kundalakesá, identifying her with Bhikkhadáyiká. The Mtu.i.303f mentions another daughter Máliní Kiságotamí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had also a son, Pathavindhara (Puthuvindhara), who succeeded him to the throne (ThagA.i.151). During the life of the Buddha Kassapa Kikí waited on him with many kinds of gifts (SnA.i.281, 283), and at his death built one of the four gates outside the Buddha's cetiya. The gate was a league in width (SnA.i.194). According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.420), Kikí was the aggupattháka of Kassapa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sanskrit books he is called Kikí, </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Khantivádí Játaka (No.313)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, under the name of Kundaka, was once born in a very rich family of Kásí. After the death of his parents he gave away his immense wealth in charity and became an ascetic in the Himálaya. Returning later to Kásí, he dwelt in the royal park, being tended by the commander-in-chief. One day Kalábu, king of Benares, visited the park with his harem and, falling into a drunken sleep, left the women to their own devices; they, wandering about and meeting the ascetic, asked him to preach to them. When the king woke he sought his women, and seeing the ascetic and being told that he had been preaching on patience (khanti), he gave orders that the ascetic's own patience be tested. The ascetic was subjected to various forms of ill-treatment until, becoming more and more angry at his composure, the king gave orders for him to be tortured by the cutting off of his limbs. As the king left the park the earth opened and he was swallowed in Avíci. The commander-in-chief, hearing what had happened, hurried off to the ascetic to ask forgiveness. The ascetic declared that he bore no malice, and died of his injuries with a blessing to the king on his lips. It is told by some that he went back to the Himálaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related at Jetavana in reference to a wrathful monk (J.iii.39-43). Kalábu was Devadatta and the commander-in-chief, Sáriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka is frequently mentioned as an example of supreme forgiveness, the ascetic being referred to as Khantivádí (E.g., DhA.i.126; KhpA.149; J.i.46; iii.178; vi.257; BuA.51). The Játaka further illustrates how a man's anger can grow towards an unoffending victim (J.iv.11), and how an angry man loses all his prosperity (J.v.113, 119).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;a HREF="../../../index')"&gt;&lt;img SRC="../../images/pitsanu.gif" border="1" alt="Home" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#top"&gt;&lt;img SRC="../../images/uparrowb.gif" ALT="Oben" border="1" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/dic_idx')"&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/zeilen.gif" alt="Zum Index" border="1" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</data>

The Buddha replies that his begging does not come within the eight causes of injury to families: viz., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the actions of kings and robbers, fire, water, loss of savings, slothfulness, wastrels and impermanence. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asibandhakaputta becomes the Buddha's follower (S.iv.322f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kula Sutta.-The five advantages which accrue to families visited by holy men: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;they cleanse their hearts and attain to heaven; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;they greet the monks respectfully and are born noble; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;they conquer greed and gain power; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;give alms and obtain wealth; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;ask questions and become wise (A.iii.244f).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.

Kitti took part in the campaigns of Parakkamabáhu against his foes, these latter being defeated at the Yakkhasúkara ford and at Billagáma.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kutumbiyaputta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-He once went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; with twenty-nine of his friends from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; to make offerings to the Buddha. Having heard the Buddha's preaching, they all became monks. After five years' residence with their teachers, they wished to retire into solitude and obtained from the Buddha topics for their meditations. While on the way to the forest, Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa weakened in his determination and turned back. When the rains were over, the others, having won arahantship, returned and reported their various attainments to the Buddha. Kutumbiyaputta heard the Buddha praise them, and made up his mind to follow their example and so to go back with them the next day to the forest. That same night, however, filled with a yearning not to delay in beginning his austerities, he slept in an upright posture; but in the middle of the night he fell down and broke his thighbone. This accident delayed the departure of the other monks, and the Buddha, hearing of it, blamed Tissa for his unseasonable zeal and related the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varana_jat_071')"&gt;Varana Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, showing how, in the past too, he had behaved similarly (J.i.316f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries lead us to believe (E.g., SA.ii.216; AA.i.29; see also Padhánakammika-Tissa) that Kutumbiyaputta did ultimately attain arahantship, for he is mentioned several times with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pitimalla')"&gt;Pitimalla&lt;/a&gt; and others as an example of one who put forth great exertion while suffering severe pain, in order to win his goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant. He lived in Piyangudípa. Dutthagámani, fleeing from the battle at Cúlanganiyapitthi, </data>
<data>wished to give a share of his food to a monk before sitting down to eat. When the meal-time was announced, the thera Gotama, hearing it with his divine ear, sent Kutumbiyaputta to receive the share set apart for the brotherhood (Mhv.xxiv.22ff; xxxii.31f). It transpired later that the food so received was divided by Kutumbiyaputta among twelve thousand monks in Piyangudípa.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Khara&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A yakkha, friend of Suciloma. He was passing through Gayá with Suciloma when the latter questioned the Buddha on his doctrine, as recorded in the Suciloma Sutta (S.i.207f.; SN., p.47f.; SNA.i.302). Khara had been a monk in a previous birth, and had once rubbed on his body oil belonging to the Sangha without asking the permission of the monks. As a result his body was ugly, and his skin coarse and rough and like a &quot;tiled roof.&quot; Whenever he wished to frighten anybody his skin would stand up like tiles on a roof. At the end of the recitation of the Suciloma Sutta, Khara became a sotápanna, and his skin became beautiful and golden-hued.

Plague breaks out in the city and attacks the chief treasurer and his wife. When about to die they bid farewell to Kumbhaghosaka, directing him to flee for his life and return later to dig up their treasure. He spends twelve years in a jungle and returns to find the treasure undisturbed; but reflecting that since he is unknown in the city he may be subjected to annoyance if he is seen digging up the treasure and spending it, he decides to earn his own living and obtains a position as foreman. One day the king, hearing his voice, exclaims: &quot;That is the voice of some rich man.&quot; Several times this happens, and then a female servant, overhearing the king's words, offers for a consideration to make him master of the man's wealth. She obtains lodgings for herself and her daughter in Kumbhaghosaka's house and contrives to make him seduce her daughter. A marriage is arranged, and Kumbhaghosaka is obliged to dig up some of the wealth in order to defray the various expenses proclaimed by the king's orders. When the plot is complete, Kumbhaghosaka is summoned before the king, who, having heard his story, confirms him in his inheritance and gives him his own daughter as wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king tells the story to the Buddha, who praises Kumbhaghosaka.

Ninety-two kappas ago he offered a kutaja-flower to Phussa Buddha. Seventeen kappas ago he was king three times under the name of Pupphita. Ap.i.191.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kutajapupphiya Thera.-Thirty-one kappas ago, while travelling through the air, he saw the Pacceka Buddha Sudassana at Cávala near Himavá, and offered him a kutaja flower (Ap.ii.451). He is probably identical either with Hárita (ThagA.i.88) or Candana Thera (ThagA.i.395f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In answer to their persistent questions, the Buddha says that the further state of both is either purgatory or rebirth as an animal (among cattle and dogs respectively). He then proceeds to describe the four kinds of actions: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(1) Dark, with dark outcome;   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(2) bright, with bright outcome;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(3) both dark and bright with similar   outcome; and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(4) neither dark nor bright with   corresponding outcome. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Punna and Seniya take refuge in the Buddha, Seniya later becoming an arahant (M.i.387ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, seeing the Buddha Siddhattha going through the air with his attendant monks, he threw up into the sky, as an offering, an asoka shoot covered with buds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Ekassara.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kukkutáráma&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kukkutáráma.-A monastery in Kosambí, built by the setthi Kukkuta (q.v.). DA.i.318, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kukkutáráma.-A pleasaunce in Pátaliputta. It was evidently the residence of monks from very early times, probably, for some time, of the Buddha himself. The Mahávagga (Vin.i.300) mentions the names of several theras who lived there: Nilavási, Sánavási, Gopaka, Bhagu, Phalikasandana. The Samyutta Nikáya (S.v.15f; 171f) records several discussions which took place there between Ananda and Bhadda. It may have been a favourite resort of Ananda, for we find the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara going there to enquire as to his whereabouts (A.v.342; M.i.349). It was also (probably at a later date) the residence of Nárada who converted King Munda (A.iii.57f), and afterwards of Sonaka, the upajjháya of Siggava, and of Candavajji, the teacher Mogaliputta-Tissa (Mhv.v.122). Buddhaghosa mentions (MA.ii.571; AA.ii.866) that the Kukkutaráma was made by Kukkuta Setthi, but gives no further particulars. Here there is probably some confusion with the áráma of the same name at Kosambí. Hiouen Thsang (Beal: op. cit.ii, 95) says that the Kukkutáráma was to the southeast of the old city of Pátaliputta and was built by Asoka when he first became a convert to the Buddha's religion. &quot;It was a sort of first-fruit and a pattern of majestic construction.&quot; Only the foundation of the building was left at the time of Hiouen Thsang's visit. It is probable that this account refers to the Asokáráma which Asoka built as the first of his Buddhist structures, and that the Asokáráma was constructed on the site of the old Kukkutáráma. It is significant that the Páli books, in recording Asoka's doings, make no mention of a Kukkutáráma existing in his time, though the Sanskrit </data>
<data>texts, the Divyávadána (E.g., pp.381f, 430ff; see also Smith: Asoka, 183, 193f), for instance, makes frequent reference to it. If the conjecture made above, namely that the Asokáráma replaced the Kukkutáráma, be correct, it may have been that the place was known by both names in Asoka's time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kukkutáráma.-See Kukkutagiri-parivena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kosala Sutta.-While Pasenadi is visiting the Buddha, a messenger arrives and announces the death of Malliká. The king is greatly grieved, but the Buddha consoles him by pointing out how it is impossible to escape old age, decay, disease, destruction. A.iii.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kosala Sutta.-Everything changes, even Pasenadi, king of Kási-Kosala, the whole universe, even Mahá Brahmá and the devas of the Abhassara world. Instability and change are everywhere; therefore the wise loathe all, having a mind only to attain in this life the anupadáparinibbána (A.v.59ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kosala Sutta.-Pasenadi visits the Buddha at Jetavana after having won a battle, and, falling at the Buddha's feet, shows great humility and does obeisance. When the Buddha asks the reason for such profound homage, the king gives various reasons for his honouring of the Buddha (A.v.65ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kurudhamma Játaka (No.276)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhananjaya')"&gt;Dhanañjaya&lt;/a&gt;, king of the Kurús, and, after his father's death, reigned in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/indapatta')"&gt;Indapatta&lt;/a&gt;. He observed the Kurudhamma - that is to say, the pañcasíla - as did the queen-mother, his queen-consort, the viceroy, the chaplain, the king's driver, his charioteer, the treasurer, the keeper of the royal granaries, the palace porter and the courtesan of the city. The country thus became very prosperous and its people happy. In the kingdom of Kalinga there was a drought and consequent scarcity of food. The king, acting on the advice of his ministers, sent brahmins to beg from the Bodhisatta the loan of his state elephant, Añjanavasabha, who was reported to bring rain. The elephant was lent willingly but no rain fell. It was thereupon decided that the prosperity of the Kurus was due to the Kurudhamma observed by the king and the others, and messengers were despatched to find out which these Kurudhammas were. From the king down to the courtesan, all had rigorously kept them, but each had unwittingly done something which he or she considered a violation of the dhamma. The messengers, therefore, had to visit each one and take down a list of the dhamma. The incidents related by each to the messengers, explaining wherein they had transgressed the dhammas, only served to emphasise how scrupulously they had conducted themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kalinga king practised the Kurudhamma and rain fell in his country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had killed a wild goose. Two monks bathed in Aciravatí, and while standing on the bank, drying, they saw two geese appear. The monks took a bet as </data>
<data>to which should hit the goose in the eye, and one of them threw a stone which pierced one eye and came out of the other. The monk was reported to the Buddha. J.ii.365ff; DhA.iv.86ff; cp.

Kulupaka Sutta.-Five qualities which make a monk disagreeable to the families he visits: he is intimate on slight acquaintance (asanthavavissásí); takes privileges without justification (anissaravikappi); tries to bring together estranged families (viyatthúpáseví); is a gossip (upakannakajappí); and is importunate (atiyácanako). A.iii.136f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

A.iii.258f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kulupaka Sutta.-Five evil results of visiting families too often-frequent sight of women and consequent danger to celibacy in varying degrees. A.iii.259.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kulupaka Sutta.-The Buddha says that Mahá Kassapa has the qualities requisite to becoming a monk worthy of visiting families.

One day the king went with her to the park, and there Senaka found her making love to a water-snake and struck her with a bamboo. She went to the Nága-world and complained that she had been ill-treated. The Nága-king sent four attendants to kill Senaka, but they, overhearing the king relating the story to his queen, reported the matter to the Nága-king. The latter confessed his error to Senaka, and in order to make amends taught him a charm which gave him the knowledge of all sounds. Senaka was told that if he taught anyone else the charm he would perish in flames. Senaka's queen discovered his possession of the charm, and did not cease to beg him to teach it to her, even though she knew that by so doing he would incur death. Unable to resist her, Senaka went with his queen to the park to teach her the charm and enter the flames. Sakka's throne was heated, and transforming himself and his wife into goats they waited for the king, and on the approach of his chariot began to make love. The steeds in the chariot were shocked and upbraided the goats for their stupidity, but the goats replied that the steeds were stupid to let themselves be fastened to a chariot which carried so stupid a king as Senaka. The king, hearing their conversation, alighted from the chariot and, sending the queen on, asked of Sakka how he could evade his promise. Sakka suggested that the queen be told that she would receive one hundred lashes as part of her initiation. The queen agreed to this, but, when the flogging started, wished to change her mind, but the king, remembering her </data>
<data>selfishness, caused the flogging to be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related concerning a monk who was tempted by his former wife. Senaka was identified with the monk; Sáriputta was the chief steed and Sakka the Bodhisatta (J.iii.275ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the verses in the Játaka occurs also in the Mahásutasoma Játaka.

She was married to Bimbisára, and a village in Kási was given to her for bath-money as part of her dowry. She was the mother of Ajátasattu. (Ajátasattu is called Videhiputta). When pregnant with him, she was filled with a desire to drink blood from the right knee of her husband, and on learning from the astrologers that this presaged the birth of a patricide, she went to the park-called, on that account, Maddakucchi (q.v.) - and tried to bring about an abortion, but failed. Bimbisára satisfied her longing. When Bimbisára was imprisoned by Ajátasattu she waited upon him, taking him food till she was absolutely prevented from doing so. After his death she died of grief, and Pasenadi made war on Ajátasattu to avenge her death. J.ii.237; 403; iii.121f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She was declared chief among women disciples with respect to the wearing of coarse robes (lúkhacívara-dharánam) (A.i.25; the DhA.iv.156 contains a story of the Buddha speaking to Sakka the praises of Kiságotamí). She came from a poor family in Sávatthi (of a setthikula, which had fallen on evil days, says the Apadána p.565, vs.19). Gotamí was her name - she was called Kisá because of her thinness. She was married into a rich family, by whom she was disdainfully treated; but as soon as she bore a son she was shown respect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Except by her husband says the Apadána loc. cit.20. The DhA.ii.270ff account, however, makes no mention of her ill treatment; on the contrary, it leads us to expect that she should have been greatly esteemed because, prior to her arrival, her father-in-law's wealth, forty crores in amount, had all turned into charcoal. When she touched the charcoal it once more became gold. This account is found also in SA.i.149).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy, however, died when just old enough to run about; his mother, distraught with grief, fearful lest the dead child should be taken from her, went about with him on her hip, seeking medicine to revive his life. People laughed at her, until one wise man, realizing her condition, directed her to the Buddha. The Buddha asked her to bring him a mustard seed from a house where no one had yet died. In the course of her search for the impossible her frenzy left her, and having grasped the truth, she laid the child in the charnel field, and returning to the Master begged admission to the Order. She became a Sotápanna, and soon after, when her insight was developed, the Buddha appeared before her in a blaze of radiance and, listening to his words, she became an arahant.

<data>AA.i.205).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the verses ascribed to her in the Therígáthá (vv.213-23), she incorporates the story of Patácárá in her own psalm, as though to utter more fully the pageant and tragedy inherent in woman's lot, whereof her own sorrow was but a phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she was a householder's daughter in Hamsavatí, and having heard the Buddha assign to a bhikkhuní the foremost rank among wearers of coarse robes, she vowed that one day the same rank should be her's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was the fifth daughter of Kikí and her name was Dhammá. Then she entered the Order and lived a celibate life (Ap.ii.564f; ThigA.190f). She is identified with the lizard in the Tittira Játaka (J.iii.543).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya (i.129f) records a visit paid to her by Mára as she sat resting in Andhavana. He was forced to retire discomfited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kiságotamí.-A Khattiya-maiden of Kapilavatthu. She saw from her balcony Siddhattha Gotama returning in his chariot to his palace on receipt of the news that a son had been born to him. Gotamí was gladdened by the sight of him, and gave vent to her exultation in the famous &quot;nibbutá-pada&quot; (nibuttá núna sá mátá, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama was pleased by the mention of the word nibbuta, which to him meant deliverance, and as a mark of his gratitude sent her the necklace of pearls which he wore, worth one hundred thousand. She accepted it gladly as a token of his love (J.i.60f; BuA.232f). She is sometimes spoken of as a cousin of Gotama, his father's brother's daughter (pitucchádhítá). (E.g., DhA.i.70; DhSA.34. A parallel has been drawn between this story and that of Luke xi.27).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kiságotamí.-Wife of the Buddha Phussa in his last lay life. Their son was Ananda. Bu.xix.16.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Kútadanta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very learned brahmin of Khánumata, which village had been given to him by King Bimbisára as a brahmadeyya. The Buddha arrived at Khánumata when Kútadanta was making preparations for a great sacrifice and, wishing this sacrifice to be successful, he consulted the Buddha on the holding of sacrifices. The Buddha preached to him the Kútadanta Sutta. At the end of the discourse he became a Sotápanna (D.i.127ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversion of Kútadanta is considered one of the great spiritual victories won by the Buddha (E.g., J.vi.329). As a disputant, Kútadanta is classed with Ambatthaka, Sonadanda and Saccaka. E.g., MA.ii.697.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kokálika (Kokáliya) Sutta (See Kokálika 2).-The story of Kokálika - according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.473), to be distinguished as Cúla Kokálika. It contains the verses preached by the Buddha to Kokálika. The verses describe the evil of back-biting and the terrors that await the back-biter after death. The Sutta Nipáta contains twenty-two verses (657-78). The Sutta Nipáta Commentary says (p.477f) that the last two stanzas are not explained in the Mahá Atthakathá, and that therefore they did not belong to the original sutta. Of the remaining twenty the last fourteen (663-76) are called by Buddhaghosa the Turitavatthugáthá, and he says that they were uttered by Moggallána as Kokálika lay dying, by way of admonition, and that, according to others, Mahá Brahma was the speaker. The first three stanzas (658-60) are, in the Samyutta Nikáya (i.149), attributed to Tudu. In the Anguttara Nikáya (v.171-4; the verses are also found in A.ii.3 and in S.i.149ff; Netti.132), also, Tudu speaks them; but according to this version the Buddha repeats them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kokálika Sutta.-Gives the story of Kokálika (2) speaking ill of Sáriputta and Moggallána before the Buddha, of Kokálika's illness and death, of his admonition by Tudu, and of the announcement of his death and subsequent birth in the Paduma-niraya by Sahampatí to the Buddha. A monk questions the Buddha on the duration of suffering in the Paduma-niraya, and the Buddha proceeds to instruct him by means of various illustrations. The sutta ends with the repetition by the Buddha of Tudu's verses. A.v.171-4; also S.i.149ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.

He was a brahmin of Pátaliputta. He entered the Order under Ananda, after the Buddha's death, and in due course won arahantship. At the First Council held in the Sattapanni Cave, he was sent to bring Ananda to the Assembly. He travelled through the earth, gave the message to Ananda, and returning through the air announced his arrival to the Sangha, through the medium-ship of a devatá who had been placed at the door of the cave to ward off Mára and his followers. Sobhita was called &quot;Khujja&quot; because he was slightly hunchbacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara he saw the Buddha passing with a large assembly of monks and praised him in ten stanzas (Thag.234-6; ThagA.i.350f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Sayampatibhániya of the Apadána. Ap.ii.410f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Khujjasobhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the Pácínaka (&quot;Eastern&quot;) monks who proclaimed the ten indulgences at Vesáli. He was one of their representatives on the Committee of the Sangha appointed to settle the dispute between the monks of Vesáli and the orthodox monks (Vin.ii.305; Dpv.iv.44; v.25, 80).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahávamsa (iv.57; this passage is also found in the Samantapásádiká i.34) this Khujjasobhita was a disciple of Ananda and, therefore, to be identified with Khujjasobhita (1). The latter was, how-ever, an arahant, and therefore not likely to side with the Vesáli heretics. The identification is evidently incorrect also on other grounds, among them that of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;a HREF="../../../index')"&gt;&lt;img SRC="../../images/pitsanu.gif" border="1" alt="Home" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#top"&gt;&lt;img SRC="../../images/uparrowb.gif" ALT="Oben" border="1" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/dic_idx')"&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/zeilen.gif" alt="Zum Index" border="1" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</data>

The Buddha thereupon tells Mahánáma of five things the practice of which will tend to progress: the tending of father and mother, the support of wife and children with well-gotten wealth, devotion to one's own business, honouring one's own ancestral gods, showing respect to good and holy men.

She was born in a ruling family at Ságala in the Madda country, and her skin was of the colour of gold. She became the chief consort of King Bimbisára. She would not visit the Buddha who was at Veluvana, lest he should speak disparagingly of her beauty with which she was infatuated. The king bade poets sing the glories of Veluvana and persuaded Khemá to go there. She was then brought face to face with the Buddha, and he conjured up, for her to see, a woman like a celestial nymph who stood facing him. Even as Khemá gazed on the nymph, whose extraordinary beauty far excelled her own, she saw her pass gradually from youth to extreme old age, and so fall down in the swoon of death. Seeing that Khemá was filled with dismay at the sight, the Buddha preached to her on the vanity of lust, and we are told that at that moment she attained arahantship. With the consent of Bimbisára she entered the Order, and was ranked by the Buddha foremost among his women disciples for her great insight (mahápaññánam aggá) (A.i.25; Dpv.xviii.9; see also MA.iv.168f.; Bu.xxvi.19; J.i.15,16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara she was a slave, and having seen the Buddha's chief disciple, Sujáta, gave him three cakes, and that same day she sold her hair and gave him alms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kassapa Buddha's time she became the eldest daughter of Kikí, king of Benares, and was named Samaní. With her sisters she observed celibacy for twenty thousand years and built a monastery for the Buddha. She learnt the Mahánidána Sutta, having heard the Buddha preach it. In the time of Vipassí she became a renowned preacher of the Dhamma, and during the time of both Kakusandha and Konágamana she had great monasteries built for the </data>

AA.i.187f; Thig.139-44; ThigA.126ff; Ap.ii.543ff; DhA.iv.57ff; cf. the story of Rúpa Nandá (DhA.iii.113-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Khemá was at Toranavatthu, between Sávatthi and Sáketa, Pasenadi, who happened to spend one night there, heard of her presence and went to see her. He questioned her as to whether or not the Buddha existed after death. She explained the matter to him in various ways, and Pasenadi, delighted with her exposition, related it to the Buddha (S.iv.374ff). She is mentioned in several places (E.g., A.i.88; ii.164; iv.347; S.ii.236) as the highest ideal of womanhood worthy of imitation, and is described as the nun par excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khemá is identified with the mother in the Uraga Játaka (J.iii.168), the queen in the Rohantamiga (J.iv.423) and in the Hamsa (J.iv.430), the queen, Khemá, in the Maháhamsa (J.v.382), and the princess in the Mahájanaka (J.vi.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khemá Therí.-One of the two chief women disciples of Dhammadassí Buddha (Bu.xvi.19; J.i.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Khemá.-The Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.791) (on A.iv.347) speaks of a Khemá Upásiká in a list of lay-women. This Khemá is most probably identical with Khemá (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Khemá.-Queen of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. She dreamed of a golden peacock preaching, and wished that her dream might come true. Though the king tried every means in his power, the wish could not be fulfilled and the queen died. See the Mora Játaka. J.ii.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Khemá.-Chief queen of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. She dreamed of a golden deer preaching the Dhamma, and her wish to see her dream come true was fulfilled (J.iv.256). For details see the Ruru Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.

Khemá.-Queen Consort of Brahmadatta, king of Benares (J.iv.413). Her story is similar to that of Khemá (5). She is identical with Khemá Therí (J.iv.423).

Kosiya Játaka (No.130).&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin of Benares had a bad wife who lay in bed by day feigning sickness and spent her nights in enjoyment. The husband worked hard to supply her with dainties, and, in consequence, could not visit his teacher who was the Bodhisatta. When the latter discovered the truth, he advised the brahmin to prepare a mess of cow-dung and other things and to insist that his wife should either swallow this medicine or get up and work. She then knew that her shamming was discovered and abandoned her evil ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a brahmin of Sávatthi, a pious follower of the Buddha, whose wife behaved in a similar way. The Buddha told him this story of the past and asked him to try the same remedy, for, he said, the brahmin and his wife were identical with the couple of the story (J.i.463f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the atítavatthu the woman is addressed as &quot;Kosiyá.&quot; The scholiast (J.i.465) adds that she belonged to the Kosiyagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kosiya Játaka (No.226).&lt;/b&gt;-The king of Benares, making war at an unseasonable time while camping in the park, saw an owl (kosiya) being attacked by crows. The king asked his minister the reason for this; the minister, being the Bodhisatta, said the owl had left his hiding-place too early-that is, before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Pasenadi, who visited Jetavana on his way to quell a border rising; the time was unsuitable for such an enterprise.

Once when the Buddha was staying in the Pávárika-ambavana at Nálandá, Kevatta visited him. The interview is recorded in the Kevatta Sutta. (D.i.211ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa (DA.i.388) speaks of him as a young householder, distinguished and wealthy, belonging to the gahapati-mahá-sala-kula, with forty crores of wealth. He was possessed of very great piety, and it was his extreme devotion to the Buddha which led him to make the request contained in the Kevatta Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kevatta.-Chaplain of Cúlani-Brahmadatta, king of Uttarapañcála. He was wise and learned and clever in device; the king followed his counsel and conquered all the territories of India except that of King Videha in Mithilá (J.vi.391-5). When at last Brahmadatta laid siege to Mithilá, Kevatta was responsible for the details of the siege, but his plans were upset by Mahosadha, who, though his junior in age, was far wiser. At one stage of the struggle Kevatta suggested that a trial of intellect be arranged between him and Mahosadha, the result of the conquest to decide the victory of Brahmadatta or Videha. The challenge was accepted, but Mahosadha, by a ruse, made Kevatta appear as though paying obeisance to him and rubbed Kevatta's head in the dust, bruising it. After the return, in disgrace, of Brahmadatta to Uttarapañcála, Kevatta meditated revenge through the instrumentality of Pañcála-candí. Kevatta visited Mithilá with a proposal that Videha should go to Uttarapañcála and marry Pañcálacandí. During this visit, Kevatta went to visit Mahosadha, but the latter, guessing that the whole thing was a plot to kill Videha, refused to see Kevatta and caused him to be ill-treated (J.vi.400-19).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kulávaka Játaka (No.31)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was born in Macala under the name of Magha. He spent his time with the heads of the other twenty-nine families in the village, engaged in various forms of social service. The headman, finding his gains diminish, made a false report to the king, who ordered Magha and his friends to be trampled by elephants; but by virtue of their mettá they could not be killed, and thereupon the king showed them great favour. After death they were all born in Távatimsa, with Magha as Sakka. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of Magha's wives - Sudhammá, Cittá and Nandá - who had persuaded him to let them share in his good work, were born as Sakka's handmaidens. But Sujátá, who had taken no part in their activities, received no such honour. At that time the Asuras shared Távatimsa with the Devas, but one day they got drunk and were hurled down to the foot of Sineru. They therefore declared war on the Devas, and during one of their fierce battles Sakka was defeated and fled over the sea in his chariot Vejayanta. When he came to Simbalivana, the chariot felled down the trees there, and the young Garulas were hurled into the sea. Hearing their cries of agony, Sakka made his driver, Mátali, turn the chariot and go back. The Asuras, seeing him return, thought it was another Sakka coming with reinforcements, and fled in terror. The Vejayanta-pásáda rose from the earth, and Sakka lived in it, having fortified his city with a fivefold guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had drunk water without first straining it, because his friend, with whom he was travelling and with whom he had fallen out, had the only strainer available. Mátali is identified with Ananda (J.i.198ff; with the introductory </data>
<data>story cp. Vin.ii.118).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the version given in the Dhammapada Commentary (i.263ff; see also SA.i.260f; DA.iii.710ff; and SNA.ii.484f; according to these accounts Sakka was helped by not 29 but 33 others), the story of Magha is related in response to a question asked of the Buddha by the Licchavi Maháli. The reason given for Sakka's flight in the Vejayantaratha also differs. According to this account, when Sujátá (q.v.) was reborn as the daughter of Vepacitti and the time came for her to choose a husband, Sakka went to the assembly in the guise of an aged Asura and was chosen by Sujátá. Sakka thereupon revealed himself and fled with his bride in the chariot, the Asuras in full chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Kulávaka Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Offerings, made to a monk by the pious, bring him no real advantage if, he is slothful; he should be strenuous and vigilant. A.i.274f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kusinárá Sutta.-Also preached at Baliharana. A monk wishing to rebuke another monk, should consider five things with regard to himself - whether he is of blameless conduct in body and speech; whether he really wishes well for his colleague and is not influenced by envy; whether he is learned in the doctrine; whether his pátimokkhas are perfect. He should also consider whether his rebuke is seasonable, justified by facts, administered gently, for the other's benefit and out of compassion for him (A.v.79f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kusinárá Sutta.-Preached at Upavattana in Kusinárá, in the Sálagrove of the Mallas. The Buddha, just before his death, invites the monks to question him with regard to any doubts or misgivings they may have. They remain silent (A.ii.79f). The sutta occurs also as part of the Mahá-Parinibbána Sutta. D.ii.137, 154.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kotisanthára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Játakas mention is made (E.g., J.iii.18; 375, 397; J.iv.113) of the Buddha when he wished to address the monks of Jetavana, asking Ananda to summon them to the Kotisanthára and ordering that a seat be prepared for him at the entrance to the Gandhakuti. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotisanthára was probably the name given to that part of the Jetavana grounds just outside the Buddha's own apartments. It may have been so called in reference to the fact that Anáthapindika bought the land by spreading on it a crore of kahápanas (kahápana-koti-santhárena) (J.i.94). Or the name may have been restricted to the part actually covered by the pieces of money, for we are told (Vin.ii.159) that the money was not sufficient to cover the whole of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were buildings in the Kotisanthára, the monks living in these buildings being referred to as &quot;Antokotisantháre vasantá.&quot; (E.g., J.iv.113) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotisanthára is generally translated as The Golden Pavement, (E.g., Ját. Trs.iii.12; iv.71) which seems to be a wrong rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kuru&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country, one of the sixteen Mahájanapadas (D.ii.200; A.i.213 etc.). Frequent references to it are found in the Páli Canon. It is said that Kuru was originally the name of the chieftains (rájakumárá) of the country and that their territory was later named after them. Buddhaghosa records a tradition (DA.ii.481f; MA.i.184 etc.) which states that, when Mandhátá returned to Jambudípa from his sojourn in the four Mahádípas and in the devalokas, there were in his retinue a large number of the people of Uttarakuru. They settled down in Jambudípa, and their settlement was known as Kururattha. It had many towns and villages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country seems to have had very little political influence in the Buddha's time, though, in the past, Pañcála, Kuru and Kekaka were evidently three of the most powerful kingdoms (See, e.g., J.ii.214). According to the Játakas (E.g., J.v.57, 484; vi.255. Also Mtu.i.34; ii.419), the kingdom of Kuru was three hundred leagues in extent and its capital, Indapatta, seven leagues in circumference. The ruling dynasty at Indapatta belonged to the Yudhitthila-gotta (J.iii.400; iv.361). Among the kings of the past, Dhanañjaya Koravya is mentioned several times (J.ii.366; iii.400; iv.450; vi.260 etc.) and reference is also made to a king called Koravya (J.iv.361; v.457) whose son was the Bodhisatta Sutasoma. During the Buddha's time, also, the chieftain of Kuru was called Koravya, and his discussion with the Elder Ratthapála, who was himself the scion of a noble family of the Kurus, is recounted in the Ratthapála Sutta (M.ii.65ff). Perhaps at one time the Kuru kingdom extended as far as Uttarapañcála, for in the Somanassa Játaka (J.iv.444), Uttarapañcála is mentioned as a town in the Kururattha, with Renu as its king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koravya had a park called Migácíra where </data>
<data>Ratthapála took up his residence when he visited his parents (MA.ii.725). The people of Kuru had a reputation for deep wisdom and good health, and this reputation is mentioned (MA.i.184f; AA.ii.820; they were also probably reputed to be virtuous; see the Kurudhamma Játaka) as the reason for the Buddha having delivered some of his most profound discourses to the Kurus, for example, the Mahánidána, and the Mahásatipatthána Suttas. Among other discourses delivered in the Kuru country are the Mágandiya Sutta, the Anañjasappáya Sutta, the Sammosa Sutta and the Ariyavasá Sutta. All these were preached at Kammássadhamma, which is described as a nigama of the Kurús, where the Buddha resided from time to time. Another town of the Kurús, which we find mentioned, is Thullakotthika, the birthplace of Ratthapála, and here the Buddha stayed during a tour (M.ii.54; ThagA.ii.30). Udena's queen, Mágandiyá, came from Kuru (DhA.i.199), and Aggidatta, chaplain to the Kosala king, lived on the boundary between Kuru and Ariga and Magadha, honoured by the inhabitants of all three kingdoms (DhA.iii.242).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kuru country is generally identified as the district around Thánesar, with its capital Indapatta, near the modern Delhi (CAGI.379f). See also Uttarakuru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He acquired his name from having dwelt long in Kosala (Thag.59; ThagA.i.134f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic in Himavá and gave the Buddha some tuberous roots. Fifty-four kappas ago he was a king named Sumekhalisama. He is evidently to be identified with Bilálidáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Khaggavisána Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third sutta of the Uraga Vagga of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sutta_nipata')"&gt;Sutta Nipáta&lt;/a&gt; (SN.vv.35-75), consisting of forty-one stanzas, each of which ends with the refrain: &quot;eko care khaggavisánakappo.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SNA.i.46ff) divides the sutta into four vaggas and gives each a separate name (except the first), the name being generally derived from the first word of the stanza. It is said that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; preached the Khaggavisána Sutta in response to a question asked of him by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; regarding the attainment of Enlightenment by Pacceka Buddhas; the Buddha gave details of their abhiníhara and patthaná, and illustrated them by reciting to Ananda stanzas which had been uttered by Pacceka Buddhas of old on various occasions and at different periods as their paeans of joy (udána).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa gives the life-story of each of the Pacceka Buddhas whose stanzas are included in this sutta. It is, however, only in the case of a few Pacceka Buddhas that the actual names are given - e.g.,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Brahmadatta (v.33), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Anitthigandha (36), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahápaduma (39),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ekavajjika-Brahmadatta (40), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ekaputtika-Brahmadatta (41),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Cátumásika-Brahma-datta (44, 64), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sítáluka-Brahmadatta (52), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Suta-Brahmadatta (58), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vibhúsaka-Brahmadatta (59), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pádalola-Brahmadatta (61),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Anivatta-Brahmadatta (62), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Cakkhulola-Brahmadatta (63),&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mátanga (74).&lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest are described as &quot;the king of Benares,&quot; or &quot;the son of the king,&quot; etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is commented on in the Culla-Niddesa (pp.56ff), in addition to those of the Paráyanavagga, an evidence of the fact that, when the Culla-Niddesa was composed, this was probably regarded as an independent sutta, not belonging to any particular group such as the Uragavagga, and that the comments on it were written at a time prior to the composition of the Sutta Nipáta as an anthology in its present form. This view is further strengthened by the fact that its mixed Sanskrit version in the Mahávastu (i.357f) is not placed in any definite group. According to the Mahávastu, the Pratyeka Buddhas, five hundred in number, were living in Rsipatana near Benares, and when they heard from the Suddhávása devas of the approach of the Buddha in twelve years, they disappeared from Rsipatana, each repeating one of the verses of the sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána (i.7ff) includes the stanzas of the Khaggavisána Sutta in its chapter called the Pacceka-buddhápadána and prefaces them with several introductory stanzas. A few stanzas are also added at the end by way of conclusion. In its exegesis the Apadána Commentary (ApA.i.106f) gives the names of several Pacceka Buddhas. They are, however, different from those given by Buddhaghosa, and correspond more nearly to those  mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isigili_s')"&gt;Isigili Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The brahmins were gathered on some business, and the Buddha walked into their meeting, thus angering them. It is said that he caused a shower of rain to fall (perhaps to give him an excuse for taking shelter). When the brahmins protested against his intrusion, the Buddha told them that it was no &quot;council&quot; where good men were not, and where the rules of debate were not observed; this sermon pleased them.

Later he became a recluse, but six times thoughts of his spade drew him back to the world. The seventh time he threw the spade into the river and shouted for joy, winning insight. The king of Benares heard his shouts, and on knowing the reason for them, resolved to join Kuddála as an anchorite. When the news spread, the people from twelve leagues round accompanied them, and Sakka sent Vissakamma to erect monasteries for them in the Himálaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Citta-Hatthisáriputta (q.v.)

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kútágárasálá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hall in the Mahávana near Vesáli. The Buddha stayed there on several occasions, and in the books are found records of various eminent persons who visited him there and of his conversations with them. Among such visitors are mentioned several Licchavi chiefs, Maháli Otthatthaddha (D.i.150ff; S.i.230f; iii.68f; A.v.86f; several visits of Maháli are mentioned; for details see Maháli. BuA. p.3 mentions that the Buddha spent his sixth rainy season in the Kútágárasálá), Nandaka (S.v.389), Sunakkhatta (M.ii.252), Bhaddiya (A.ii.190f), Sálha and Abhaya (A.ii.200), all attended by numerous retinues; their senápati, Síha, who went with five hundred chariots, having only decided after much hesitation to see the Buddha (A iii.38f; iv.79, 179ff); the Jaina Saccaka, whom the Buddha won only after much argumentation, as described in the Cúla- and the Mahá-Saccaka Suttas (M.i.227ff; 237ff; the Licchavi Dummukha is also mentioned, M.i.234, as having been present when Saccaka argued with the Buddha); the householder Ugga of Vesáli, acclaimed by the Buddha for the possession of eight eminent qualities (A.iii.49; iv.208f; S.iv.109); the upásaka Vásettha (A.iv.258f), the two goddesses, daughters of Pajjunna, both known as Kokanadá (S.i.29f ); and the brahmin Pingiyáni (A.iii.237f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Licchavis waited on the Buddha and ministered to him during his stay in the Kútágárasálá, and it is said that they were of various hues: some blue, others yellow, etc. And Pingiyání, seeing the Buddha shining in their midst, surpassing them all, once uttered the Buddha's praises in verse, winning, as reward from the Licchavis, five hundred upper garments, all of which, be, in turn, presented to the Buddha (A.iii.239f). On one occasion, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks regarding the six </data>
<data>spheres of sense contact, Mára arranged an earthquake to break the monks' concentration, but failed to achieve his object (S.i.112). Several Játakas were related by the Buddha in the Kútágárasálá: the Sigála (J.ii.5), the Telováda (J.ii.262), the Báhiya (J.i.420), and the Ekapanna (J.i.504). It was here that the Buddha finally agreed to grant the request of the five hundred Sákyan women, led by Pajápatí Gotamí, that they might be ordained as nuns. They had followed the Buddha hither from Kapilavatthu (A.iv.274f; Vin.ii.253f; J.ii.392). The Buddha gave Pajápatí Gotamí, at her special request, a summary of his doctrine (A.iv.280). It was also at the Kútágárasálá that the Buddha uttered his prophecy as to the ultimate downfall of-the Licchavis (S.ii.267f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was customary for the Buddha, when staying at the Kútágárasálá, to spend the noonday siesta in the woods outside the Mahávana, at the foot of a tree; visitors coming at that time would, if their desire to see him was insistent (see, e.g., D.i.151; A.iii.75), seek him there or be conducted to him. Sometimes he would express his desire to see no one during such a retreat, except the monk who brought him his food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one occasion the retreat lasted a fortnight, and on his return he found that a large number of monks had committed suicide as a result of a sermon he had preached to them before his retreat on the un-loveliness of the body. He then caused the monks to be assembled, and asked them to concentrate on breathing (S.v.320f). Sometimes the Buddha would walk from the Kútágárasálá to places of interest in the neighbourhood  - e.g., the Sárandada-cetiya (A.iii.167) and the Cápála-cetiya (S.v.258; A.iv.308f). It was from the Cápála-cetiya, during one of these walks that he gazed for the last time on Vesáli. He then returned to the Kútágárasálá, where he announced that </data>
<data>his death would take place within three months (D.ii.119f; S.v.258ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.310; MA.i.450), there was a monastery (sangháráma) built for the monks in the Mahávana. Part of it consisted of a storeyed house, with a hall below surrounded only by pillars. These pillars held the gabled room which formed the main part of the Buddha's Gandha-kuti there. The hall lay from north to south and faced east (DA.i.311), and from this hall the whole monastery came to be known as the Kútágárasálá. There was a sick ward attached to the monastery, where the Buddha would often visit the patients and talk with them (E.g., S.iv.210f; A.iii.142).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books also contain the names of others who stayed at the Kútágárasálá when the Buddha was in residence - e.g., Ananda, who was visited there by the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakumára (A.i.220); Anuruddha, who lived there in a forest hut (S.iii.116; iv.380); Nágita, the Buddha's former attendant, and Nágita's nephew the novice Síha (D.i.151); also Cála, Upacála, Kakkata, Kalimbha, Nikata, and Katissaha, all of whom left the Kútágárasálá and retired to the Gosingasálavana, when the visits of the Licchavis to the Buddha became disturbing to their solitude (A.v.133f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later times Yasa Kákandakaputta is mentioned as having stayed there (Sp.i.34; Mhv.iv.12; Dpv.v.29).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen thousand monks under Mahá-Buddharakkhita went from the monastery in Mahávana in Vesáli to the foundation ceremony of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxix.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Northern books (Dvy.136, 200; AvS.8; Mtu.i.300), the Kútágárasálá was on the banks of the lake Markatá (Markatahradatíre).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kesi visits the Buddlia, and in answer to a question says that he trains some horses by mildness, some by harshness, and others by both; those which do not submit to his training he destroys. The Buddha says that just so does he deal with men. Some he tames by mildness - telling them what is good and showing them the way to heaven; others by harshness - condemning the evils in them; yet others by both. Those who do not submit to this discipline he destroys, by refusing to admonish them (A.ii.112f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (Sp.i.120) that the Kesi Sutta should be one of those used to explain the term purisadamma-sárathí in reference to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kutidúsaka Játaka (No.321)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A singila-bird, seeing a monkey shivering in the rain, suggested to him that he should build a nest. The monkey, in envy, destroyed the bird's nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a novice &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ulunka_saddaka')"&gt;Ulunkasaddaka&lt;/a&gt;, who had burnt down &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá-Kassapa's&lt;/a&gt; hut in a forest near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;. At that time Mahá Kassapa had two novices, one serviceable and helpful and the other ill-behaved. Whatever was done by his comrade the latter would pretend that he himself had done it. One day, in exasperation, the good novice heated water for the Elder's bath and then hid it in a back room, leaving only a little in the boiler. When the other novice saw the steam rising he informed the Elder that his bath was ready. When asked where was the water, he let a ladle down into the almost empty boiler and the ladle rattled. When the story became known he was nick-named Ulunkasaddaka (&quot;Rattle-ladle&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being found fault with on this and several other occasions, he bore the Elder a grudge, and one day, having set fire to the Elder's hut, he ran away. Later he was born first as a peta and then in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aviici')"&gt;Avíci&lt;/a&gt;. This incident was reported to the Buddha by monks who came from Rájagaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monkey of the Játaka is identified with the wicked novice. J.iii.71ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kosala-deví&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter of Mahá Kosala and sister of Pasenadi. She was married to Bimbisára, and a village in Kási was given to her for bath-money as part of her dowry. She was the mother of Ajátasattu. (Ajátasattu is called Videhiputta). When pregnant with him, she was filled with a desire to drink blood from the right knee of her husband, and on learning from the astrologers that this presaged the birth of a patricide, she went to the park-called, on that account, Maddakucchi (q.v.) - and tried to bring about an abortion, but failed. Bimbisára satisfied her longing. When Bimbisára was imprisoned by Ajátasattu she waited upon him, taking him food till she was absolutely prevented from doing so. After his death she died of grief, and Pasenadi made war on Ajátasattu to avenge her death. J.ii.237; 403; iii.121f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kitágiri (v.l. Kítágiri)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village of the Kásis, on the road from Kási to Sávatthi. It was the headquarters of the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, who lived there, behaving in a shameless and wicked manner. A certain monk, on his way to Jetavana, passed through the place and was asked by a pious layman to complain to the Buddha of their ill-behaviour. On hearing of it, the Buddha sent Sáriputta and Moggallána to proclaim on them an act of banishment. (J.ii.387; Vin.ii.9f; iii.179f; DhA.ii.108f). Some time after, when the Buddha visited the place with a large company of monks, including Sáriputta and Moggallána, the Assajipunabbasuká, were asked to provide lodgings for the visitors. They agreed to do so for the Buddha, but would have nothing to do with Sáriputta and Moggallána (Vin.ii.171).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.668), Kitágiri was the name of a nigama (township). In the Samantapásádiká (iii.613f) it is called a janapada, favoured by adequate rain and fruitful crops, and therefore chosen by the Assaji-Punabbasukas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kútavánija Játaka (No. 98).&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kútavánija Játaka (No. 98).-The Bodhisatta was once a merchant named Pandita and entered into partnership with a dishonest man, Atipandita. When the time came for dividing the profits the latter claimed a larger share, for he, as his name showed, was the &quot;brains&quot; of the business. To settle the dispute he hid his father in a hollow tree, and feigning to consult a Tree-sprite, referred the matter to the Tree. Pandita suspecting the ruse, lighted a fire at the foot of the tree and thus exposed the cheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a cheating merchant of Sávatthi, who is identified with Atipandita. He tried to rob his honest partner, always putting off his claims, in the hope that he would die from the hardships suffered in a long journey they had undertaken for trade. J.i.404f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kútavánija Játaka (No.218).-A villager once deposited five hundred ploughshares with a friend in the town, but when he came to claim them, he was told that they had been eaten by mice, and was shown the dung the mice had left behind. Some time later the villager took his friend's son to bathe, hid him in a house, and reported to the townsman that the boy had been carried off by a hawk. When he was taken before the judge, who was the Bodhisatta, he protested that in a place where mice ate ploughshares a hawk could easily carry off a boy. The Bodhisatta settled their dispute (J.ii.181ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introductory story is similar to that of No.1 above.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the son of a nobleman in the Vajji country, and having heard the Buddha preach the Ratana Sutta he left the world. One day, while striving after insight, he was caught in the rain and sought shelter in a woodman's hut. As soon as he sat down there on a mat he became an arahant. The Buddha, having heard by virtue of his divine ear the conversation between the monk and the watchman, uttered verses of approbation. The monk was so called because he obtained insight in a hut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he had given cool water to Padumuttara Buddha (Thag.v.56; ThagA.i.129f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Udakapújaka Thera of the Apadána. Ap.i.142f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kutivihárí Thera.-An arahant. His story is similar to the above. He pursued his meditations in a very old hut and had thoughts of building another; but a spirit, seeking his welfare, pointed out to him in words which, though simple, carried a profound meaning, that a new hut would mean new pain. Thus urged on, Kutivihári became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he gave a fan of split reeds to Padumuttara Buddha (Thag.v.57; ThagA.i.130f). He is probably identical with Nalamáliya Thera of the Apadána. Ap.i.143f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There need be no official tradition, no authority, no subtle reasoning or the like, in order to ascertain the true doctrine and distinguish it from the false. The noble disciple whose mind is pure has four consolations. He knows that whether there be a next world or not his happiness is secure. A.i.188f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kusa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/o/okkaaka')"&gt;Okkáka&lt;/a&gt;, king of&lt;a href="kusaavaatii')"&gt;Kusávatí&lt;/a&gt; and of his queen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siilavati')"&gt;Sílavatí&lt;/a&gt;. Okkáka has no heir, in spite of performing various rites. But at length, by the favour of Sakka, Sílavatí miraculously gives birth to two sons. The elder, though ill-favoured, is supernaturally wise and is called Kusa. The younger, very handsome, is called Jayampati. Kusa consents to marry only on condition that a princess can be obtained exactly like an image which he himself has fashioned. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pabhavati')"&gt;Pabhávatí&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madda')"&gt;Madda&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sagala')"&gt;Ságala&lt;/a&gt;, is found to fulfil this condition, and is married to Kusa. The bride is not to look upon her husband's face until she has conceived, but Kusa plays various pranks upon her and she accidentally discovers how ugly he is. She leaves him immediately and returns to her father's court. Thither Kusa follows her, and under a variety of menial disguises, including that of a cook, tries, but in vain, to win her affection. At length &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; intervenes. He sends letters, purporting to come from King Madda, to seven kings, offering Pabhávatí to each of them. They arrive in Ságala simultaneously and threaten to destroy the city. Madda decides to cut Pabhávatí into seven pieces, and she is only saved from immediate death by the despised husband. At his appearance the kings flee, for wherever he looks the earth trembles. Kusa returns with his wife to Kusávatí and they live there happily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleased at Kusa's victory, Sakka gives him a jewel called the Verocanamani. It was octagonal, and was evidently handed </data>
<data>down in the succession of kings, for we are told that one of the tests, set by Videha, king of Mithilá, to discover the proficiency of Mahosadha, was for him to break the old thread in this gem, remove it, and insert a new one. (J.vi.340; according to SA.i.115 and DA.iii.266, the jewel was also in the possession of Pasenadi; but see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasara_jat_092')"&gt;Mahására Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, where no mention is made of Kusa).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference is made elsewhere (E.g., MT.552) to a tálavanta (fan?) possessed by Kusa, in which could be seen the forms of all things in the world. He also possessed the Kokanadavíná (q.v.) given by Sakka to Sílavatí.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kusa is called Síhassara, and his shout, when he appeared before the seven kings, announcing his name, was one of the four shouts heard throughout Jambudípa (SNA.i.223; SA.i.248).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dípavamsa (iii.40) speaks of Kusa and Mahákusa, both descended from Mahásammata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Alongside this river ran the road taken by men who were banished by the people of Sibi; the road was also taken by Vessantara on his way to exile (J.vi.493). The river is five leagues from Suvannagiritála and five from Árañjara. J.vi.514.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He lived in Mangana, and was one of those who shared the sour millet-gruel given by Dutthagámani in his flight from battle. Khuddaka Tissa divided it among sixty thousand monks in the Kelása Vihára (Mhv.xxxii.53f). He was one of the pacchágataká (late comers?) to the Assemblies of Kuddálaka, Múgapakkha, Ayoghara, and Hatthipála (J.vi.30).

Kumárapeta Vatthu.-A man of Sávatthi abused those who gave alms to the Buddha and his monks, but his mother made him retract his words and give alms for seven days. He was born later as the son of a courtesan who left him in a graveyard. The Buddha went there and proclaimed that the boy had a great future before him. The boy was adopted by a rich man and spent his wealth in deeds of piety. After death he was born as Sakka's son. Pv.iii.5; PvA.194ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kumárapeta Vatthu.-Two sons of the Kosala king committed adultery and were born as petas. One night they uttered loud lamentations and the inhabitants of Sávatthi sought the Buddha's protection. The Buddha explained things to them, and the people gave alms and made over their merit so gained to the petas. Pv.iv.6; PvA.261f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Kundadhánavana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forest near the Koliyan village of Kundiya. (DhA.iv.192 calls it Kundikoliya, v.l. Kundikeliya). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once the residence of the Yakkha Kunda, who favoured offerings made to him with kunda-dhána (vessels containing rice-powder?). A woman, who was the head of a village (gámapatiká), formed a settlement on a spot indicated by the Yakkha and was guarded by him. She thus came to be known as Kundiyá, and when, later, the Koliyan nobles built a city on the same spot, the city was known as Kundiya. In the forest tract the Koliyan nobles built a monastery for the Buddha and his monks. It was while the Buddha was dwelling in this monastery that Suppavásá gave birth to Sívalí, after prolonged labour pains, which only ceased after she received the Buddha's blessing (Ud.ii.8; UdA.122; DhA.iv.192f; J.i.407). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;v.l.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Koliyá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the republican clans in the time of the Buddha. The Koliyá owned two chief settlements - one at Rámagáma and the other at Devadaha. The Commentaries (DA.i.260f; SNA.i.356f; A.ii.558; ThagA.i.546; also Ap.i.94) contain accounts of the origin of the Koliyas. We are told that a king of Benares, named Ráma (the Mtu.i.353 calls him Kola and explains from this the name of the Koliyas), suffered from leprosy, and being detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and retired into the forest. There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon recovered, and, while wandering about, came across Piyá, the eldest of the five daughters of Okkáka, she herself being afflicted with leprosy. Ráma, having cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons. With the help of the king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in doing so. The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site was discovered on a tiger-track (vyagghapatha) it was also called Vyagghapajjá. The descendants of the king were known as Koliyá. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Kunálá Játaka (J.v.413), when the Sákyans wished to abuse the Koliyans, they said that the Koliyans had once &quot;lived like animals in a Kola-tree,&quot; as their name signified. The territories of the Sákiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohiní. The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed relationship with the Buddha. (It is said that once the Koliyan youths carried away many Sákiyan maidens while they were bathing, but the Sákiyans, regarding the Koliyans as relatives, took no action; DA.i.262). A quarrel once arose between the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohiní, which irrigated </data>
<data>the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention of the Buddha. In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the membership of the Order, and during the Buddha's stay in the neighbourhood, he lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara. (For details of this quarrel and its consequences see J.v.412ff; DA.ii.672ff; DhA.iii.254ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attached probably to the Koliyan central authorities, was a special body of officials, presumably police, who wore a distinguishing headdress with a drooping crest (Lambacúlakábhatá). They bore a bad reputation for extortion and violence (S.iv.341).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the places already mentioned, several other townships of the Koliyans, visited by the Buddha or by his disciples, are mentioned in literature - e.g.,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Uttara, the residence of the headman Pátaliya (S.iv.340); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sajjanela, residence of Suppavásá (A.ii.62); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sápúga, where Ananda once stayed (A.ii.194); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Kakkarapatta, where lived Díghajánu (A.iv.281); and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Haliddavasana, residence of the ascetics Punna Koliyaputta and Seniya (M.i.387; see also S.v.115). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nisabha (ThagA.i.318), Kakudha (SA.i.89) (attendant of Moggallána), and Kankhá-Revata (Ap.ii.491) (and perhaps Sona Kolivisa, q.v.), were also Koliyans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death the Koliyans of Rámagáma claimed and obtained one-eighth of the Buddha's relics, over which they erected a thúpa (D.ii.167; Mhv.xxi.18, 22ff).

It was once the refuge of Vikkamabáhu II (Cv.lxi.43) and, again, of Gajabáhu (Cv.lxx.355). After Gajabáhu's death his ministers took his body to Kotthasára, and the village became the headquarters of Mánábharana (Cv.lxxi.6, 11). There was in the village a garrison for mercenary soldiers, specially occupied by the Keralas, and this garrison once revolted against Parakkamabáhu I (Cv.lxxiv.44).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the Damilas, Mágha and Jayabáhu, set up a fortification there (Cv.lxxxiii.15; see also Cv.Trs.i.229, n.1). It was evidently a point of strategic importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Keralá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Kerala. The Keralas served as mercenary soldiers to the kings of Ceylon. They rebelled against Mahinda V. and governed certain parts of the country (Cv.iv.5, 12). They fought in the army of Parakkamabáhu I. against Gajabáhu (Cv.lxix.18; lxx.230). Later, when Parakkamabáhu's forces were employed in Rohana, the Kerala mercenaries in Kotthasára conspired with others to capture Rájarattha, but their attempt was foiled (Cv.lxxiv.44f). The Keralas formed the largest part of Mágha's army which devastated Ceylon, and Mágha gave over to them, for their use, whatever they coveted in the conquered territory. They overran the country, carrying destruction wherever they went (Cv.lxxx.61, 76; lxxi.4). Later, however, they suffered severe defeat at the hands of Parakkamabáhu II (Cv.lxxxiii.20). Once a Pandu king fled from the Cola king and took refuge among the Keralas (Cv.liii.9; Cv. Trs.i.172, n.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Korabya, Koravya, Korabba&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the generic name given to the king of the Kurús (cf. Brahmadatta). Once in the Játakas Koravya is given as the name of the king of Indapatta in the Kuru country, this king being the father of Sutasoma (J.v.457). Elsewhere (J.ii.368; iii.400, 402; v.59, 61, 65; vi.256, 268, 273) Koravya appears as a title of Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurús. Koravya may also have been used as an adjective, for we find it explained as Kururatthavásika (E.g., J.vi.273). The Koravya king probably belonged to the Yudhitthilagotta (See J.iv.361). The Anguttara Nikáya (iii.369f) mentions a king Koravya who owned a large banyan tree named Suppatittha. According to the Ratthapála Sutta (M.ii.65; see also Thag.776.ff; ThagA.ii.34; for details see Ratthapála), in the Buddha's day, too, the ruler of Kuru was called Koravyarájá, and he owned a park which seems to have been called Migácíra (q.v.). This king was evidently interested in religious discussion. Thullakotthika was his capital. The Avadánasataka (i.67; ii.118; see also Camb. Hist. of India, i.121, which refers to a half-mythical Pañcála king, Kraivya) speaks of a Kauravya of Thullakotthika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Kukkuta Játaka (No.383).-The story of a cat who tried to deceive a cock - with the idea of eating him - by offering to become his wife. Her efforts failed. The cock was the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk who was tempted by the sight of a woman (J.iii.265f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Játaka is illustrated in the Bharhut Stúpa.

I have not been able to trace a sutta of this name. The Theragáthá Commentary (ThagA.i.380) says that the Buddha visited Bhagu at Bálakalonakagáma after his attainment of arahantship to congratulate him on his solitude (ekaviháram anumoditum). The Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.222) goes further and says that the Buddha visited him on the way from Kosambí to Pácínavamsadáya, and that during this visit the Buddha preached to him the advantages of solitude (ekacáraváse ánisamsam) for the whole day after the midday meal and the whole night (sakalapacchábhattañ c'eva tiyámarattiñ ca). The Vinaya passage (Vin.i.350), however, which records this visit does not make mention of any such special sermon, but merely says that the Buddha inquired after Bhagu's health and wellbeing. v.l.

Among them was a very poor man who, having nothing else to offer at the tree, took a cake made of husk powder. But when he saw the other rich offerings, he felt that the sprite would never accept so humble a gift and wished to eat the cake himself. The tree-sprite appeared, took the offering, and revealed to the man that heaps of treasure lay buried under the tree. The man informed the king of this, and the king, in return, appointed him royal treasurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a poor man of Sávatthi. Once the people of a whole street in that town pooled their resources in order to entertain the Buddha and his monks to a meal of rice-gruel and cakes. The poor man, unable to afford anything else, made a bran-cake and by sheer determination put it in the alms-bowl of the Buddha himself. When it became known that the Buddha had accepted it, people of all classes crowded round the man offering him wealth if he would share with them the merit he had gained. After consulting with the Buddha, the man accepted the offers, and the gifts he received amounted to nine crores. That same evening the king appointed him treasurer.

At that time it was a small city, &quot;a branch-township with wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle,&quot; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; was, at first, disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/n_r/parinibbaana')"&gt;Parinibbána&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, by preaching the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasudassana_s')"&gt;Mahá-Sudassana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been &lt;a href="kusaavaatii')"&gt;Kusávatí&lt;/a&gt;, the royal city of Mahá-Sudassana (D.ii.146). Between Kusinárá and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava')"&gt;Pává&lt;/a&gt;, three gávutas away (DA.ii.573) - from where the Buddha came to Kusinárá on his last journey from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;, stopping at various places - lay the stream of Kakuttha on the banks of which was the Ambavana; beyond that was the Hiraññavatí river, and near the city, in a south-westerly direction, lay the Upavattana, the Sála-grove of the Mallas, which the Buddha made his last resting-place (UdA.238; DA.ii.572f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death his body was carried into the city by the northern gate and out of the city by the eastern gate; to the east of the city was Makutabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas, and there the body was cremated. For seven days those assembled at the ceremony held a festival in honour of the relics (D.ii.160f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the Buddha had three reasons for coming to Kusinárá to die:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) Because it was the proper venue for the preaching of the Mahá-Sudassana Sutta; &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;(2) because Subhadda would visit him there and, after listening to his sermon, would develop meditation and become an arahant while the Buddha was still alive; and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) because the brahman Doha would be there, after the Buddha's death, to solve the problem of the distribution of his relics (UdA.402f; DA.ii.573f6). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scene of his death, Kusinárá became one of the four holy places declared by the Buddha to be fit places of pilgrimage for the pious, the other three being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;, Buddhagayá and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.140). Mention is made of other visits paid to Kusinárá by the Buddha, prior to that when his death took place. Thus, once he went there from Ápana and having spent some time at Kusinárá, proceeded to Átumá. The Mallas of Kusinárá were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinárá who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred. It was on this occasion that Roja the Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green vegetables and pastries (Vin.i.247f). During some of these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he preached two of the Kusinárá Suttas (A.i.274f; v.79f) and the &quot;Kinti&quot; Sutta (M.ii.238f). A third Kusinárá Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana. (A.ii.79; for another discourse to some noisy monks at Upavattana, see Ud.iv.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kusinárá was the birthplace of Bandhula and his wife Malliká (DhA.i.338, 349). It was twenty-five yojanas from Rájagaha (DA.ii.609; acc. to Fa Hsien, p.40, it was twenty-four yojanas from Kapilavatthu) and lay on the high road from Alaka to Rájagaha, the road taken by </data>
<data>Bávarí's disciples (SN.v.1012).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was evidently the road taken also by Mahá Kassapa from Pává, when he came to pay his last respects to the Buddha (Vin.ii.284).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a late tradition, one-eighth of the Buddha's relics were deposited in a cairn in Kusinárá and honoured by the Mallas (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ancient times Kusinárá was the capital of King Tálissara and twelve of his descendants (Dpv.iii.32). It was also the scene of the death of Phussa Buddha at the Setáráma (v.l. Sonáráma) (BuA.195; Bu.xix.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang's&lt;/a&gt; day there still existed towers and Sarighárámas erected to mark the spots connected with the Buddha's last days and obsequies at Kusinárá. According to his account (Beal. op. cit.li. lii. n) Kusinárá was nineteen yojanas from Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the northern Buddhists the place was also known as Kusigráma (Kusigrámaka) and Kusinagarí (E.g., Dvy.152f, 208).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kusinárá is identified with the village of Kasia at the junction of the river Rapti and the smaller Gondak and in the cast of the Gorakhpur district (CAGI.i.493). A copper plate belonging to the thúpa erected at the site of the Buddha's death has recently been discovered (CAGI.i.714). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Kusinárá are called Kosináraká.

The scholiast says he belonged to the Kosiyagotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/salikedara_jat484')"&gt;Sálikedára Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.278f) mentions a brahmin of Sálindiya, called Kosiyagotta, probably for the same reason.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="kosiya_jat_130_226_470')"&gt;Kosiya Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.465f) speaks of a Kosiya-bráhmaní. All these are either addressed or spoken of as Kosiya in their different contexts. The name Kosiya is also used twice in speaking of Sakka - once by the Buddha (D.ii.270), once by Mahá Moggallána (M.i.252) - and again by Guttila (J.ii.252) and by Mahá Kassapa (Ud.iii.7; UdA.200; DhA.i.429).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name means &quot;belonging to the Kusika family.&quot; It is once used of Indra in the Rg Veda, in what exact sense is not known. Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.ii.296f; see also Dvy.632; Mtu.iii.200, 202, </data>
<data>315, 403) that perhaps we have here a survival from the time when Indra was only the god of a Kusika clan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word Kosiya (e.g., J.ii.208) means &quot;Owl&quot; and is probably one of the several clan names which are also names of animals (cf. Vaccha).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kosiya&lt;/b&gt;.-See Macchari-Kosiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kosiya Thera&lt;/b&gt;.-An arahant. He belonged to a brahmin family in Magadha and was called by his gotta-name. He often listened to the preaching of Sáriputta and, joining the Order, in due course won arahant ship. He was a gate-keeper of Bandhumatí and in the time of Vipassí Buddha gave to the Buddha a piece of sugar-cane. (Thag.370-4; ThagA.i.431f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Ucchukandika of the Apadána. Ap.ii.393.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Kosiya&lt;/b&gt;.-See Kosika (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Kosiya.&lt;/b&gt;-See Nanda Mánava.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Khandhaká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to a portion of the Vinaya Pitaka. This is generally further divided into two parts, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Mahávagga&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Cullavagga&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains an attempt to give a coherent picture of the whole legal life of the Sangha, with detailed and connected accounts of the admission thereto, the ceremony of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/u_v/uposatha')"&gt;uposatha&lt;/a&gt;, the annually recurring observances connected with the rainy season, etc. An account is given, in the case of each regulation, of the occasion on which it was formulated by the Buddha. The separate chapters are arranged in chronological order, and are intended to present a connected account of ecclesiastical history from the time of the Enlightenment of the Buddha down to that of the Second Council, convened one hundred years after the death of the Buddha. (See Oldenberg, Vinaya Pitaka I., Introd., xxii.f.; Law, Páli Lit., i.14f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways the Khandhaká, resemble the Sutta Vibhanga of the Vinaya, but while in the case of the Vibhanga the stories were added later to an original basis of regulations, the Pátimokkha, in that of the Khandhaká the regulations and the stories were contemporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Khandhakas consist of eighty bhánaváras (DA.i.13), and are divided into twenty-two chapters, ten in the Mahávagga and twelve in the Cullavagga. Each chapter is called a khandhaka. Thus, the first chapter is the Mahákhandaka; the second, the Uposathakhandhaka, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;a HREF="../../../index')"&gt;&lt;img SRC="../../images/pitsanu.gif" border="1" alt="Home" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#top"&gt;&lt;img SRC="../../images/uparrowb.gif" ALT="Oben" border="1" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/dic_idx')"&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/zeilen.gif" alt="Zum Index" border="1" width="40" height="40"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</data>

The Buddha assures him that he need not distress himself as   he has for long practised faith and virtue, learning, renunciation and   insight. His mind will soar aloft like a jar of butter or of oil, broken in a   deep pool of water, where the fragments of the jar will sink but the butter   and the oil float. S.v.370.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;The circumstances are similar to   those of the above sutta. The noble disciple, possessed of unwavering loyalty   to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and who cultivates virtues dear to   the Ariyans, such a one is destined to Nibbána. Mahánáma is such a one.

The Buddha answers   his questions. S.v.395f.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;The Buddha tells Mahánáma, in   answer to his question, that the noble disciple who has won the fruit (ágataphala)   and grasped the teaching (viññátasásana), lives a life of abundance, his mind   occupied with thoughts of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, the virtues   he practises, his liberality and the devas.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá Thúpa &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great Thúpa in Anurádhapura, built by Dutthagámani. The site on which it was erected was consecrated by the visit of all the four Buddhas of this kappa and was at the upper end of the Kakudhavápi. It was one of the spots at which Mahinda scattered campaka flowers by way of homage, and the earth trembled. When Mahinda informed Devánampiyatissa of the great sanctity of the spot and of its suitability for a Thúpa, Tissa immediately wished to build the Thúpa himself, but Mahinda bade him desist, telling him that the work would be carried out in the future by Dutthagámani. Tissa recorded this prophecy on a pillar of stone (Mhv.xv.51ff., 167ff). When Dutthagámani had won his victory over the Damilas and had brought peace to the country, he saw the prophecy inscribed on the stone pillar, but was unwilling to start the work as the people were too crippled with regard to money to be able to support such an immense undertaking. But the devas read his thoughts and provided him with all the necessaries for the building of the Thúpa. Prepared bricks were found on the banks of the Gambhíranadí, copper near Tambapittha, silver in the Ambatthakolalena, pearls at Uruvelá, and gems in a cave near Pelivápigáma. The building was started on the full moon day of Visákha. The foundation stone was laid on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month of Asálha. Great celebrations marked the event, arrangements for which were in the hands of the ministers Visákha and Sirideva. Monks were present not only from all over Ceylon but from many other places: eighty thousand under Indagutta from Rájagaha, twelve thousand under Dhammasena from Isipatana, sixty thousand under Piyadassí from Jetavanáráma, eighteen thousand under Mahá Buddharakkhita from Mahávana in Vesáli, thirty thousand under Mahá Dhammarakkhita from Ghositáráma in Kosambí, </data>
<data>forty thousand under Mahá Sangharakkhita from Dakkhinágiri in Ujjeni, one hundred and sixty thousand under Mittinna Asokáráma in Pátaliputta, two hundred and eighty thousand under Uttinna from Kasmíra, four hundred and sixty thousand under Mahádeva from Pallabhogga, thirty thousand under Yonamahá Dhammarakkhita from Alasandá, sixty thousand under Uttara from Viñjhátaví, thirty thousand under Cittagutta from Bodhimanda vihára, eighty thousand under Candagutta from Vanavása, and ninety six thousand under Suriyagutta from Kelása vihára. Of arahants alone ninety six crores were present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the king stepped into the space left open for him, he expressed the desire that, if his worship were to have a happy result, theras bearing the names of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Sangha, should take their places on the east, south, and west sides respectively, and a thera bearing the name of Ananda on the north side, each thera to be surrounded by a group bearing the same name. The king's wish was fulfilled; the theras in question and their companions were called Mahá Buddharakkhita, Mahá Dhammarakkhita, Mahá Sangharakkhita and Mahánanda. As the king was about to mark the space to be covered by the cetiya, the Thera Siddhattha, looking into the future, told him to define only a moderate space for the Thúpa. This the king did; then, looking at the theras immediately around him, he inquired their names and rejoiced to find them so auspicious, they being Siddhattha, Mangala, Sumam, Paduma, Sívalí, Candagutta, Suriyagutta, Indagutta, Ságara, Mittasena, Jayasena, and Acala. He then laid the first foundation stone on the east side on sweet smelling clay prepared by Mittasena and sprinkled with water by Jayasena; Mahásumana placed jasmine flowers on the stone. Immediately the earth trembled in wonder. The minister who helped the king to mark out the area of the cetiya was </data>
<data>Suppatitthitabrahmá, son of Nandisena and Sumanadeví. At the end of the ceremony, Piyadassí preached to the assembled populace, and many attained to various fruits of the Path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thúpa was like a water bubble in shape; its architect was Sirivaddha and his assistant Acala. Orders were given that no unpaid work should be done in the construction of the cetiya. Arahants caused the three terraces of flower offerings to the Thúpa (pupphádháná) to sink nine times into the earth, in order, as they explained, to strengthen the foundations. The cetiya was one hundred and twenty cubits high, and for the ten flower terraces alone ten crores of bricks were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Relic Chamber was of unparalleled magnificence, and consisted of four medavannapásáná, each eighty cubits in length and in breadth and eight inches thick. These were brought from Uttarakura by two sámaneras, Uttara and Sumana. In the Chamber were placed sculptural representations of the chief events connected with the Buddha's life as well as pictures of several Játakas, including the Vessantara. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For list see Mhv.xxx.71ff.; the MT (549ff.) contains a long disquisition to prove that there is no reason to doubt the account given of the contents of the Relic Chamber, for in its construction the power (iddhi) of the king, of devas, and of arahants came into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work of the Relic Chamber was under the personal supervision of Indagutta Thera, of great iddhi power. When the Chamber was ready for the enshrining of the Relics, Sonuttara of Pújá parivena was entrusted with the task of obtaining them. In a previous birth, as Nanduttara, he had vowed to have the power of doing this, and now was his opportunity. He went to Mañjerika Nága bhavana, where the Relics, washed away from the Thúpa at Rámagáma, were in the custody of the Nága Mahákála, and by a display of iddhi power obtained them </data>
<data>from the Nága against his desire. They represented one dona of the Buddha's Relics, and the Buddha had predicted that they would ultimately be placed in the Mahá Thúpa. These Relics were enshrined on the fifteenth uposatha day in the light half of the month of Ásálha, under the constellation of Uttarásálha. Many devas and brahmas and nágas were present as on the day of the Buddha's Enlightenment, and ninety six crores of arahants attended the ceremony. As the king, after passing three times round the cetiya, ascended it on the east side, and was about to descend into the Relic Chamber, bearing on his head the Casket of Relics, the casket opened and the Relics rose out of it, and taking on the form of the Buddha, performed the Twin Miracle, as at the foot of the Gandamba. When the Relics were placed on the couch prepared for them they assumed, as the king had desired, the form of the Buddha as he lay on his death bed. For a whole week the celebrations lasted, and during this period the king offered to the Relics the dominion of Ceylon, and Indagutta decreed that the people of Ceylon, wherever they might be, should be able immediately to visit the Thúpa should they desire to do so. At the end of the seven days, the two sámaneras, Uttara and Sumana, closed the Chamber with the medavannapásáná set apart for the purpose, while arahants pronounced that flowers offered in the Relic Chamber should not wither, nor scents dry up; the lamps should not be extinguished nor anything whatever perish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building of the Máha Thúpa is described in Mhv. chaps xxviii-xxx.; MT. 514 83; Dpv.xix.1ff.; also Thúpavamsa (pp. 66ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treasures enshrined in the Mahá Thúpa were worth twenty crores, the rest cost one thousand crores (Mhv.xxxii.18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the parasol of the Mahá Thúpa and the plaster work could be completed, Dutthagámani fell ill, and his brother, Saddhátissa, </data>
<data>summoned from Díghavápi, contrived with great skill to make the Thúpa look complete, that the king might see it before he died. After the king's obsequies had been performed, in a place within sight of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxxii.58), Saddhátissa finished the work yet remaining and established celebrations to be performed three times daily at the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxxii.60; Mhv.xxxiii.5). Lañjatissa levelled the ground between the Mahá Thúpa and the Thúpáráma and built three stone terraces at the cost of three hundred thousand (Mhv.xxxiii.22f). Khallátanága made the courtyard of sand, surrounded by a wall (Mhv.xxxiii.31). Bhátika constructed two vediká round the courtyard (Mhv.xxxiv.39). It is said (MT. 553f) that Bhátika was taken by the arahants into the Relic Chamber, and he held great celebrations in its honour (see Bhátikábhaya). Mahádáthika Mahánága converted the sand courtyard into a wide court laid out with kiñcakkha stones on plaster (Mhv.xxxiv.69), while Amandagámani erected a parasol over the cetiya (Mhv.xxxv.2) and Ilanága made the Lambakannas construct a roadway leading up to the Mahá, Thúpa (Mhv.xxxiv.17). Sirinága had the whole Thúpa gilded and crowned with a new parasol (Mhv.xxxvi.24), this work being undertaken again later by Sanghatissa (Mhv.xxxvi.65), while Sanghabodhi made rain to pour down by means of prostrating himself in the courtyard (Mhv.xxxvi.75). Jetthatissa offered two precious gems to the Thúpa (Mhv.xxxvi.126), while Aggabodhi I. placed on the Thúpa a golden umbrella (Cv.xlii.32), From this time onward the country passed through very troublous times and the Mahá Thúpa was neglected. But it was restored by Parakkamabáhu I. (Cv.lxxiv.10; lxxvi.106f; lxxviii.97) and again by Kittinissanka (Cv.lxxx.20); it was later pillaged by Mágha (Cv.lxxx.68), and remained neglected till the time of Parakkamabáhu II., who started the work of </data>
<data>reconstruction (Cv.lxxxvii.66), which was completed by his son Vijayabáhu IV. Cv.lxxxviii.83; after this, the cetiya once more fell into disrepair and has so continued till recently, when an attempt is being made to rebuild it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahá Thúpa has been a place of pilgrimage for Buddhists from the time of its building down to the present day, even when the place was deserted and its courtyards overgrown with creepers (e.g., Vibhá.446). There seems to have been a hall for pilgrims to the west of the cetiya (Vibhá.446). When the Buddha's sásana disappears, all the Relics of the Buddha deposited in various cetiyas all over Ceylon will gather together at the Mahácetiya, and from there will go to the Rajáyatana cetiya in Nágadípa, thence to the, Mahábodhipallanka, where all the Relics, assembled from everywhere, will take the form of the Buddha seated at the foot of the Bodhi tree. Then they will be consumed by self generated flames (Vibhá.433).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahá Thúpa is known by other names: Mahácetiya, Ratanaváluka (Cv.lxxvi.106), Ratanaváli (Cv.lxxx.68), Sonnamáli (Mhv.xxvii.3) (Hemamáli), and Hemaváluka (Cv.li.82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a number of monks staying in the Ambátakagrove in Macchikásanda were entertained by Citta-gahapati to a sumptuous meal. At the end of the meal, Citta, escorted them back to the monastery. On the way the monks were overcome by the heat, and Mahaka, the junior monk, with the permission of his senior, made by his magic power a cool wind to blow and wrought a thunderstorm accompanied by gentle rain. Citta was greatly impressed, and, seeking Mahaka in his cell, asked him to perform some miracle. Mahaka told him to put his cloak on the veranda and to scatter a bundle of grass on it. Then he retired to his cell, locked the door, and caused a flame to dart through the keyhole and burn the grass without damaging the cloak. Citta was overcome with surprise, and promised to supply Mahaka with all requisites. Mahaka thanked him, but soon after left Macchikásanda never to return. Because he did not wish to enjoy gains won by a display of iddhi power; S.vi.288ff.; the story is also referred to at Vsm. 393.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha does so, and adds that those who follow his teaching are sure of deliverance and of birth in happy worlds and are destined for Nibbána. Vacchagotta is very pleased and seeks admission to the Order, but the Buddha says that he must first pass four months as a probationer. At the end of that time he enters the Order and the Buddha further expounds the Doctrine to him. Shortly after he becomes an Arahant. M.i.489 97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahámangala Játaka (No. 453)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, called Rakkhita, was born in a wealthy brahmin family. He married, and then, having distributed all his wealth, became an ascetic with five hundred followers. During the rains, his disciples went to Benares and dwelt in the king's park, while Rakkhita stayed in the hermitage. At that time there was a great discussion going on among men as to what constituted auspiciousness, and Rakkhita's disciples, on being consulted, said that Rakkhita would solve the problem. They, therefore, went to Rakkhita's hermitage and asked him the question, which he answered in a series of eight verses. (The mangalas enumerated in these verses differ from those given in the Mangala Sutta). The disciples, having learnt the verses, returned to Benares, where they expounded them, thus setting all doubts at rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mangala_s')"&gt;Mahámangala Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. It happened that in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; there was a large assembly at the Santhágára, and a man rose and went out, saying, &quot;This is a day of good omen.&quot; Some one, hearing this, inquired the meaning of &quot;good omen.&quot; One said, &quot;The sight of a lucky thing is a good omen.&quot; But this was denied, and then began the discussion on omens, which, in the end, was carried to Sakka, and referred by him to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior disciple of Rakkhita is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.72 9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The monks repeated this to the Buddha, who said that none save himself knew the satisfaction, the perils, and the deliverance which attend pleasures of sense, etc.; he then proceeded to explain the pleasures of the senses, the perils that attend them, and the deliverance there from, which is to shed all desire and appetite therefore.

Near by were the Tissamaháráma and the Anuráráma built by Subha. It is first mentioned (Mhv.xxii.8) as the residence of Devánampiyatissa's younger brother, Mahánága, who founded the Rohana dynasty, but, as a settlement, it probably dates back to the most ancient times. Mahánága built in it the Nágamahá vihára. Mahátissa built the Mahápáli Hall in Mahágáma and attached to it the Dáthaggabodhi-parivena (Cv.xlv.42). The Damilas (probably in the time of Mahínda IV.) destroyed Mahágáma, but the buildings were restored by Vijayabáhu I. Cv.lx.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Several passages in the Pitakas (E.g., D.i.89, 114, 120; A.i.163; M.ii.136; SN.vs.600, 1000, etc.) mention brahmins as claiming that this theory of the Mahápurisa and his natal marks belonged to their stock of hereditary knowledge. The Buddhists, evidently, merely adopted the brahmin tradition in this matter as in so many others. But they went further. In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lakkhana_s')"&gt;Lakkhana Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.142ff) they sought to explain how these marks arose, and maintained that they were due entirely to good deeds done in a former birth and could only be continued in the present life by means of goodness. Thus the marks are merely incidental; most of them are so absurd, considered as the marks of a human being, that they are probably mythological in origin, and a few of them seem to belong to solar myths, being adaptations to a man, of poetical epithets applied to the sun or even to the personification of human sacrifice. Some are characteristic of human beauty, and one or two may possibly be reminiscences of personal bodily peculiarities possessed by some great man, such as Gotama himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from these legendary beliefs, the Buddha had his own theory of the attributes of a Mahápurisa as explained in the Mahápurisa Sutta (S.v.158) and the Vassakára Sutta (A.ii.35f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.761) that when the time comes for the birth of a Buddha, the Suddhávása Brahmás visit the earth in the guise of </data>
<data>brahmins and teach men about these bodily signs as forming part of the Vedic teaching so that thereby auspicious men may recognize the Buddha. On his death this knowledge generally vanishes. He defines a Mahápurisa as one who is great owing to his panidhi, samádána, ñána and karuná. A Mahápurisa can be happy in all conditions of climate.

Thag.vss.387-92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahánága.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Mutasiva and viceroy of Devánampiyatissa. His wife was Anulá, for whose ordination Sanghamittá came over from Jambudípa (Mhv.xiv.56; Dpv.xi.6; xvii.75). His second wife was a foolish woman who tried to poison him in order to get the throne for her son. While he was building the Taraccha tank, she sent him some mangoes, the top one of which, intended for him, was poisoned. But it was her son who ate the mango and died. Mahánága thereupon went to Rohana, where he founded the dynasty of that name at Mahágáma. His son was Yatthálayaka Tissa. Mahánága built the Nágamahá vihára and the Uddhakandara vihára.

He was one of the last to attain arahantship among those who left the world with the Bodhisatta in various births (J.iv.490). He did not sleep for seven years, after which he practised continual meditation for sixteen years, becoming an arahant at the end of that time. SNA.i.56; MA.i.209; SA.iii.155.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His fame was great, and there is a story of a brahmin who came all the way   from Pátaliputta to Kálavallimandapa in Rohana to visit him. The brahmin entered   the Order under him and became an arahant (AA.i.384). Once, while Mahánága was   begging alms at Nakulanagara, he saw a nun and offered her a meal. As she had   no bowl, he gave her his, with the food ready in it. After she had eaten and washed   the bowl, she gave it back to him saying, &quot;Henceforth there will be no fatigue   for you when begging for alms.&quot; Thereafter the Elder was never given alms worth   less than a kahápana. The nun was an arahant. DhSA.399.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Mahánága Thera. &lt;/b&gt;Incumbent of Bhátiyavanka vihára. He received alms from Sáliya in his previous birth.

One day, while visiting their own village, they went to their mother&#39;s house for alms. The mother, not quite sure who they were, asked if they were her sons. But they, not wishing for any bonds of affection, gave an evasive reply. SA.ii.125.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Mahánága Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He lived in Uccatalanka (Uccaválika).

Vsm.706.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Mahánága.&lt;/b&gt; A king of Ceylon, mentioned in the Dhammasangani Commentary (DhSA.399). While travelling to India from Ceylon he won the favour of an Elder, and on his return became king. Out of gratitude he established gifts of medicine in Setambangana for as long as he lived.

The latter, in gratitude, took him to the Gokannasamudda, </data>
<data>and there, having conjured up a Nága, prophesied Mahánága&#39;s future. Mahánága entered Silákála&#39;s service, and was sent by him to collect revenue in Rohana. Later he was made Andhasenápati, and he established himself master of Rohana. He once attempted to fight against Dáthápabhuti, but soon gave up the attempt. Taking advantage of the confusion in Kittisirimegha&#39;s dominions, Mahánága advanced against him, killed him, and seized the throne. Among his benefactions was the grant of the village of Jambalambaya to Uttara vihára, Tintinika to Mahávihira, and Vasabha in Uddhagáma to Jetavana vihára, together with three hundred fields for the supply of rice soup. He also gave Círamátikavára to Mahávihára and instituted a gift of rice soup. He renovated the Mayúraparivena and Anuráráma in the Mahádevarattakuruva vihára in Kásikhanda. He reigned for only three years (556-9 A.C.), and was succeeded by his nephew, Aggabodhi I. (Cv.xli.69ff), who built a vihára in his memory and assigned it to an Elder versed in the Tipitaka.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá Arittha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nephew of Devánampiyatissa. He was the king's chief minister, and led the embassy which was sent to Asoka soon after Devánampiyatissa ascended the throne (Mhv.xi.20). Asoka conferred on him the title of Senápati (Mhv.xi.25). It is said that he had fifty five elder and younger brothers who all joined the Order at Cetiyagiri at the end of a sermon by Mahinda on the Vassúpanáyikakhandha (Mhv.xvi.10). This was before the commencement of the rainy season, but elsewhere (Mhv.xviii.3; perhaps here we have to deal with two different traditions) it is said that Arittha was sent in the month of Assayuja -  after the pavárana, when the rains were over -  to Pátaliputta to fetch Sanghamittá and the Bodhi tree from the court of Asoka, and that, he agreed to go only on condition that he should join the Order on his return. The king consented, and, his mission successfully concluded, he entered the Order with five hundred others and attained arahantship (Mhv.xix.5, 12, 66). He died in the reign of Uttiya (Mhv.xx.54). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samantapásádiká (Sp.i.102ff) gives an account of a recital (sangíti) held in Ceylon by Mahá Arittha. The scene was the parivena of the minister Meghavannábhaya in the Thúpáráma, where sixty eight thousand monks were assembled. A seat, facing south, was provided for Mahinda, Arittha's seat, the dhammásana, facing north. Arittha occupied this seat at Mahinda's request, and sixty eight Mahá-theras, led by Mahinda, sat around him. Devánampiyatissa's younger brother, Mattábhaya Thera, with five hundred others, were present in order to learn the Vinaya, the king also being present. When Arittha began his recital of the Vinaya, many miracles occurred. This was on the first day of the pavárana ceremony in the month of Kattika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahá Arittha's chief disciples were Tissadatta, Kálasumana </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá-atthakathá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oldest and most important of the Commentaries on the Tipitaka, brought, according to tradition, to Ceylon by Mahinda, who translated it into Singhalese (Cv.xxxvii.228f). It thus came to be called the Síhalatthakathá. Besides exegetical material on the Páli Canon, it contained also historical materials on which were later based the Páli Chronicles, the Mahávamsa and the Dípavamsa. For a description see Geiger's Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa, pp. 44, 63, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahá-atthakathá was the chief source from which Buddhaghosa drew his materials for his Commentaries and is often referred to in his works, particularly in the Samantapásádiká. E.g., Sp.i.2; ii.494; 265; iii.537, 616, 617, 627, 701, 716, 718, 726; iv. 744, 776, 783, 817, 863, 914, 923; DhSA.157; DA.i.180, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahá-atthakathá was in charge of the monks of the Mahávihára at Anurádhapura. It was superseded by the Commentaries of Buddhaghosa, Dhammapála and others, and is not now extant. It is often referred to merely as Atthakathá. E.g., VibhA.56, 155, 200, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

As monks, they receive presents, esteem, and repute. These things so please them and satisfy their aspirations that they become conceited and disparage others. Thus they grow remiss and a prey to Ill. Their case resembles that of a man who, needing the best of timber, goes into a forest and is satisfied with cutting off the leafy foliage or the bark of the trees, knowing nothing of the grades of wood. On the other hand, the monk who is satisfied only when he reaches the end of Ill is like a man who takes only the choicest timber, passing over the other.

Mahákála Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a merchant family of Setavyá, and, while on a journey to Sávatthi with five hundred carts, he heard the Buddha preach at Jetavana and entered the Order. He lived in the charnel field meditating, and, one day, the crematrix Kálá, noticing him, arranged the limbs of a recently cremated body near the Thera that he might gaze at them. With these as a topic of meditation, he soon became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thag.vss.151f.; his story is given in much greater detail at DhA.i.66ff.; there he is said to have been the eldest of three brothers, of whom the others were Majjhimakála and Cúlakála. He went with the latter to Sávatthi, where both of them joined the Order. After becoming an arahant, Mahákála went with the Buddha to Setavyá and dwelt in the Simsapá grove, Cúlakála accompanying him. Cúlakála's wives invited the Buddha and the other monks to a meal, and he himself went on earlier to make arrangements. His wives disrobed him. At the end of the meal, Mahákála was left behind by the Buddha to make the thanksgiving. His eight wives surrounded him and stripped him of his robes, but, knowing their intention, he disappeared through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety one kappas ago, while wandering near the mountain Urugana, he saw the rag robe of an ascetic and offered three kinkinika flowers in its honour (ThagA.i.271f). He is probably identical with Pamsukúlapújaka Thera of the Apadána. Ap.ii.434; but see ThagA.i.79, where the same Apadána verses are quoted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Mahákála&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An upásaka of Savatthi who was a sotápanna. One day he took the uposatha vows and, having listened throughout the night to the preaching, was washing his face in the pool near Jetavana early the next </data>
<data>morning, when thieves who had broken into a house and were being pursued put their stolen goods near him and ran away. He, being taken for a thief, was beaten to death. When this was reported to the Buddha, he related a story of the past in which Mahákála had been a forest guard of the king of Benares. One day he saw a man entering the forest road with his beautiful wife and, falling in love with the wife, invited them to his house. He then had a gem placed in the man's cart, and the latter was beaten to death as a thief. DhA.iii.149ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Mahákála&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Naga king who dwelt in the Mañjerika Nágabhavana. When the Buddha, after eating the meal given by Sujátá, launched the bowl up stream, it travelled a short way and then stopped, having reached the Nága's abode under the Nerañjará, and then came into contact with the bowls similarly launched by the three previous Buddhas of this kappa. To the Nága because of his long life it seemed that the previous Buddha had died only the preceding day, and he rejoiced to think that another had been born. He went therefore to the scene of the Buddha's Enlightenment with his Nága maidens and they sang the Buddha's praises. J.i.70, 72; this incident is among those sculpturally represented in the Relic Chamber of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxxi.83); see also Dvy.392; Mtu.ii.265, 302, 304. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kála's life span was one kappa; therefore he saw all the four Buddhas of this kappa, and when Asoka wished to see the form of the Buddha, he sent for Mahákála, who created for him a beautiful figure of the Buddha, complete in every detail (Mhv.v.87f.; Sp.i.43, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha's relics, deposited at Rámagáma, were washed away, Mahákála took the basket containing them into his abode and there did them honour till they were removed, against his will, by Sonuttara. </data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahálatá pasádhana (-pilandhana)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very costly ornament of gold. In the time of the Buddha it was possessed only by three persons: Bandhula's wife, Malliká, Visákhá and Devadániyacora (DA.ii.599; at DhA.i.412 the daughter of the treasurer of Benares is substituted for Devadániya). Visákhá once left it behind in the monastery, where she had gone to hear the Buddha preach, and when she sent her slave girl for it Ananda had already put it away. She, thereupon, refused to take it back and had it sold. It was worth nine crores, the workmanship being worth one hundred thousand. No one was found able to buy it, so Visákhá herself paid the price for it, and, with the proceeds, erected the Migáramátupásáda (DhA.i.411ff). Malliká, after the death of her husband, refused to wear her jewels, and, when the Buddha's body was being taken for cremation, she washed her ornament in scented water and placed it on the Buddha's bier with the following resolve: &quot; May I, in future births, have a body that shall need no ornaments, but which shall appear as though it always bore them (DA.ii.597).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The making of Visákhá's ornament took four months, with five hundred goldsmiths working day and night. In its construction were used four pint pots (náli) of diamonds, eleven of pearls, twenty two of coral, thirty three of rubies, one thousand nikkhas of ruddy gold, and sufficient silver. The thread work was entirely of silver, the parure was fastened to the head and extended to the feet. In various places, seals of gold and dies of silver were attached to hold it in position. In the fabric itself was a peacock with five hundred feathers of gold in either wing, a coral beak, jewels for the eyes, the neck feathers and the tail. As the wearer walked the feathers moved, producing the sound of music. Only a woman possessed of the strength of five elephants </data>

It is first mentioned in the account of the campaigns of Vijayabáhu I (Cv.lviii.39). His ádipáda, Vikkamabáhu, made it his capital and lived there (Cv.lx.90), as did Kittisirimegha, brother of Mánábharana (Cv.lxi.23). Later, Sirivallabha lived there with his queen Ratnávalí, her two daughters and the young Parakkamabáhu (Cv.lxiii.4). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Parakkamabáhu became king as Parakkamabáhu I., he wished to bring the city under his power, and sent Damiládhikarí Rakkha and Rakkha Kañcukináyaka to subdue it. This they did only after much difficulty, owing to the severe resistance of the rebels of Rohana. After its capture, Damiládhikári Rakkha held a great festival in celebration of his victory, and the place was made the headquarters of Parakkamabáhu's forces in Rohana. Cv.lxxv.19, 70, 115ff.; 162f.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;1. Mahánáma Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in a brahmin family of Sávatthi, and, after hearing the Buddha preach, entered the Order. Taking a formula of meditation, he dwelt on the hill called Nesádaka. Unable to prevent the rising of evil thoughts, he was disgusted with himself, and climbing a steep crag, made as if to throw himself down, and evoking insight became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sumedhá Buddha he was a brahmin teacher skilled in the Vedas, and the Buddha visited him in his hermitage on the banks of the Sindhú and was given honey by him (ThagA.vs.115; ThagA.i.227ff). Mahánáma is probably identical with Madhudáyaka Thera of the Apadána. Ap.ii.325f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Mahánáma Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya')"&gt;Pañcavaggiyá&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.82). He became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt; on the third day after the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammacakkappavattana')"&gt;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. He became an arahant on the day of the preaching of the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anattalakhana_s')"&gt;Anattalakkhana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, together with the other Pañcavaggiyá (AA.i.84; MA.i.390). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahánáma once visited Macchikásanda, and there Cittagahapati, seeing him beg for alms and pleased with his bearing, invited him to his house, gave him a meal, and listened to a sermon by him. Citta was greatly pleased, and offered his pleasure garden of Ambátakavana to Mahánáma as a gift to the Order and built there a great monastery. DhA.ii.74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. Mahánáma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya')"&gt;Sákiyan&lt;/a&gt; rájá, son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/amitodana')"&gt;Amitodana&lt;/a&gt;; he was elder brother of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; and cousin of the </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. When the Sákiyan families of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt; sent their representatives to join the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mahánáma allowed Anuruddha to leave the household, he knowing nothing of household affairs. Vin.ii.180f.; DhA.i.133; iv.124, etc.; but according to Northern sources (Rockhill, p. 13) he was son of Dronodana; according to ThagA. (ii.123) Ananda was a brother (or, at least, a step brother) of Mahánáma, for there Ananda's father is given as Amitodana. But see MA.i.289, where Mahánáma's father is called Sukkodana and Ananda's Amitodana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahánáma showed great generosity to the Sangha, and was proclaimed best of those who gave choice alms to the monks (A.i.26). Once, with the Buddha's permission, he supplied the Order with medicaments for three periods of four months each. The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chabbaggiyaa')"&gt;Chabbaggiyá&lt;/a&gt;, always intent on mischief, tried in vain to discourage him. Vin.iv.101; AA. (i.213) adds that this was during the period of want experienced by the Buddha and his monks at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veranjaa')"&gt;Verañjá&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the year, Mahánáma wished to continue the supply of good food to the Buddha and his monks, but the Buddha refused his permission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahánáma was a devoted follower of the Buddha and wished to understand the Doctrine. The books record several conversations between him and the Buddha, and Ananda, Godha, and Lomasavangísa (see &lt;a href="mahanama_s')"&gt;Mahánáma Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lomasa_vangisa')"&gt;Lomasavangisa&lt;/a&gt;). Once when the Buddha arrived at Kapilavatthu he asked Mahánáma to find him lodging for the night. Mahánáma tried everywhere without success, and finally suggested that the Buddha should spend the night in the hermitage of </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bharandukalama')"&gt;Bharandu Káláma&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.327f). This he did, and was joined there the next morning by Mahánáma; as a result of the discussion between the Buddha, Mahánáma and Bharandu, the last-named left Kapilavatthu never to return. On another occasion, Mahánáma visited the Buddha at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigrodharama')"&gt;Nigrodháráma&lt;/a&gt; where the Buddha was convalescing after a severe illness, and at once Mahánáma asked a question as to whether concentration followed or preceded knowledge. Ananda, who was present, not wishing the Buddha to be troubled, took Mahánáma aside and explained to him the Buddha's teachings on the subject. See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkaa_sutta')"&gt;Sakka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (S.i.219f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahánáma had a daughter &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa')"&gt;Vásábhakhattiyá&lt;/a&gt;, born to him by a slave-girl named Nágamundá, and when &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; asked the Sákiyans to give him in marriage a Sákiyan maiden they met in the Mote Hall, and, following the advice of Mahánáma, sent Vásabhakhattiyá to him. In order to allay any suspicions, Mahánáma sat down to a meal with her, taking one mouthful from the same dish; but before he could swallow it a messenger arrived, as secretly arranged, and summoned him away. He left, asking Vásabhakhattiyá to continue her meal (DhA.i.345f.; J.i.133; iv. 145f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_dukkhakkhandha_s')"&gt;Cúla Dukkhakkhandha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sekha_sutta')"&gt;Sekha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, both preached to Mahánáma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His resolve to attain to eminence as the best distributor of pleasant food to the monks was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He was then a householder of Hamsavatí and heard the Buddha confer a similar rank on a monk (AA.i.213).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Mahánáma is included in a list of exemplary lay devotees (A.iii.451). The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samantapaasaadikaa')"&gt;Samantapásádiká&lt;/a&gt; (Sp.iv.857) adds that Mahánáma was one month older than the Buddha and that he was a sakadágámí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahánáma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Licchavi. One day while walking about in the Mahávana in Vesáli he saw some young Licchavis paying homage to the Buddha and accused them of inconsistency. For details see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaara_s')"&gt;Kumára Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.75ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Mahánáma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon. He was the younger brother of Upatissa II. and was for some time a monk, but he carried on an intrigue with Upatissa's wife, and she killed her husband. Then Mahánáma became a layman, assumed the sovereignty, and married Upatissa's queen. He built refuges for the sick, enlarged the Mahápáli Hall, and erected the Lohadvára , Ralaggáma, and Kotipassávana viháras, which he gave to the monks of Abhayagiri. A vihára which he built on the Dhúmarakkha mountain, he gave, at the instigation of his queen, to the monks of Mahávihára. He ruled for twenty two years (409 31 A.C.). It was during his reign that Buddhaghosa arrived in Ceylon and wrote his Commentaries, dwelling in a vihára given by the king. Cv.xxxvii.209ff.; see also P.L.C. 96. The king seems to have also been called Sirinivása and Sirikudda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Mahánáma Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incumbent of Díghasanda (or Díghásana) Vihára (Cv.xxxix.42). He is generally identified with the uncle of Dhátusena mentioned elsewhere (Cv.xxxviii.16). Moggallána I. built for him the Pabbata vihára (Cv.xxxix.42). Mahánáma is generally regarded as the author of the older part of the Mahávamsa.

The colophon to the book (PSA.526) states that he lived in the Uttaramanti parivena in the Mahávihára and finished his work in the third year after the death of Moggallána (probably Moggallána I.). The Gandhavamsa (Gv.70) says that the work was written at the request of an upásaka, also named Mahánáma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;8.

When Paduma's mother died, his father took another wife. On one occasion the king had to leave the city to quell a border rising, and, thinking the dangers too great to take his queen with him, he entrusted her to the care of Paduma. The campaign was victorious. In the course of making arrangements for the celebration of his father's return, Paduma entered the queen's apartments. She was struck by his amazing beauty, and fell in love with him, inviting him to lie with her. On his indignant refusal, she feigned illness, and, on the return of the king, falsely accused him of having ill treated her. The king gave orders, in spite of the protestations of the people, that Paduma should be thrown from the &quot;Robbers' Cliff.&quot; The deity of the mountain saved his life and entrusted him to the care of the Nága king, who took him to his abode, where he stayed for one year. Paduma then went to the Himálaya and became an ascetic. The king heard of this and went to offer him the kingdom, but it was refused by Paduma. The king, convinced of the falsity of the charge brought against Paduma, caused the queen to be flung from the Robbers' Cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Ciñcamánaviká's false accusations against the Buddha. Ciñcá was the wicked queen, Devadatta the king, Sáriputta the deity, and Ananda the Nága. J.iv.187 96; DhA.iii.181ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

At this meeting Sakka rejoices with the devas of Távatimsa over the increase in their numbers owing to the appearance in their midst of new devas produced by the good kamma of the followers of the new view of life put forward by the Buddha. Sakka expresses his joy in a song and then utters an eulogy on the eight qualities of the Buddha. Brahmá Sanankumára appears and desires to hear the eulogy, which is, accordingly, repeated for his benefit. Sanankumára says that the Buddha has ever been thus wise, and tells the story of Disampati and his son Renu. Disampati has a purohita called Govinda and when he dies Disampati is distressed, but, at the suggestion of Renu, appoints Govinda's son Jotipála in his place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the death of Disampati Renu becomes king, and, with Jotipála's help, divides his kingdom into seven to be shared by himself and six of his friends, the divisions of the kingdom being Dantapura, Potana, Máhissati, Roruka, Mithilá, Campá and Báránasi; and the kings, respectively, are: Sattabhú, Brahmadatta, Vessabhú, Bharata, Renu and two Dhataratthas. Jotipála, now called Mahágovinda by virtue of his post, trains seven others to fill the posts of stewards to the seven kings. Mahágovinda acquires the reputation of having seen Brahmá face to face, and, in order to justify this reputation, he takes leave of Renu and practises meditation for four months. During his meditation, Sanankumára appears before him and tells him that he may see Brahmá face to face and attain communion with him. Here we have the teaching regarding the ideal brahmin. Mahágovinda decides to leave the world and carry out the teachings of Sanankumára. Having obtained the leave of his master, he enters the homeless </data>
<data>life, where he practises the four ecstasies of love, pity, sympathy in joy and equanimity. He teaches these to his disciples, and, after death, they are all born into the Brahma world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of Pañcasikha's recital, the Buddha tells him that he himself was Mahágovinda and therefore remembers all that life. D.ii.220 51; cp. Janavasabha Sutta, also Mtu.iii.197ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahágovinda Sutta, brahmacariyá is explained as the four infinities (appamaññá), infinite love, etc. DA.i.178; MA.i.275.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

During the troubles caused by the brigand Bráhmanatissa, he travelled about in the company of Isidatta Thera, maintaining themselves on whatever they could find. One day a maiden made three balls of food, gave one to Isidatta, the second to Mahásona, and wished to give the third to Isidatta; but her hand turned, and the food fell into Mahásona's bowl. Later, he lived with five hundred others in Mandaláráma vihára. One day, while in Kálakagáma for alms, they were entertained by a pious devotee. The latter asked for Mahásona and showed him special honour, though Mahásona was only a junior monk. Some time after, Mahásona returned to the Mahávihára in Anurádhapura and received many gifts, which he distributed among the Sangha. Vibhá.446ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahásuññatá Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Nigrodháráma in Kapilavatthu. The Buddha was staying in the cell erected by Kálakhemaka, and near by, in the cell erected by Ghatáya, Ananda, with many monks, was making robes. The Buddha knew from the number of pallets outside the cells of Kálakhemaka that many monks were in residence there. He therefore addressed Ananda, telling him of the joys of tranquility and solitude. A monk should dwell apart and concentrate his heart internally and thus develop the four jhánas. He then knows that, whatever his posture, he will be free from evil dispositions; his speech will be free from faults, his thoughts pure. A monk should always search his heart to discover if he has any traffic with pleasures of sense. A disciple should follow his master's footsteps, not in order to obtain interpretations of canonical law, but solely to hear words which conduce to passionless ness, illumination, Nibbána (M.iii.109 18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is also called Ganabheda, because it tends to break up crowds. Once, in the Válikapitthi vihára, Abhidhammika Abhaya recited this sutta with several others, and, understanding its import, dwelt apart and attained arahantship during the rains.

Ráhula stops and sits under a tree meditating. Sáriputta approaches and suggests that he should develop ánápánasati. Later in the evening Ráhula asks the Buddha how he can do this. The Buddha describes how it is done by regarding all the elements   earth, water, fire, air and space, both personal and external   with disgust and loathing of heart. One should not allow sensory impressions to lay hold of one's heart, just as the earth remains impassive whatever may be thrown upon it. It is so with the other elements. One should grow in loving-kindness, compassion, in gladness over the welfare of others, in equanimity, contemplation of the body's corruption, perception of the fleeting nature of things, and in the mindfulness which comes from ordered breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.i.420 6; it is perhaps a part of this sutta which is quoted at Mil. 385, 388; see Mil. Trs.ii.312, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

For twenty one years he practised meditation on his way up and down to the village for alms (gatapaccágatikavatta). People working in the fields, seeing him constantly stop and walk back again, would wonder why he did so. But he did not heed their curiosity, and after twenty years he became an arahant. That night the deity at the end of his walk illuminated it with the radiance of her fingers, and Sakka, Brahmá, and other gods came to do him honour. His colleague, Vanavásí Mahátissa, asked him the next day the reason for all the light, but he evaded the question (SA.iii.154f.; Vibhá.352; MA.i.208f; SNA.i.55f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MA.i.524) that during the period of his meditations, he wept every pavárana day to see that he was yet a &quot;learner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

This conversation resulted from Maháli having heard the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. (See&lt;a href="mahali_s')"&gt;Maháli Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maháli was educated at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt;. After his return to Vesáli, he devoted himself to the education of the young Licchavi men, but, through overexertion, lost his sight. He continued to instruct them, however, and was given a house by the gate, which led from Sávatthi into Vesáli. The revenue from this gate, worth one hundred thousand, was given to him (DhA.i.338). When Bandhula came to Vesáli, to satisfy the pregnancy longings of his wife Malliká, Maháli, hearing the rumble of his chariot, instantly recognised it. He warned the Licchavis not to interfere with Bandhula, and, finding that they insisted on pursuing him, urged them to turn back when they saw Bandhula's chariot sink up to the nave, or at least when they heard a, sound like the crash of a thunderbolt, or when they saw a hole in the yokes of the chariot. But they paid no heed to his warnings and were killed (DhA.i.350f.; J.iv.148f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Licchavis decided to invite the Buddha to Vesáli, to rid the city of its plagues, Maháli it was who went with the son of the </data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahávamsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great Chronicle of Ceylon. The first part of the work-  i.e., to the time of King Mahásena -  is attributed to Mahánáma Thera (MT.687). The continuation of the Chronicle is called the Cúlavamsa. The first portion of the Cúlavamsa -  i.e., from Mahásena to the reign of Parakkamabáhu II. -  is traditionally ascribed to a thera named Dhammarakkhita (Cv. Trs.ii.155, n.3). The next section -  i.e., to the time of Kittisiri Rájasíha - was written by Tibbatuváve Thera, Mahánáyaka of Puppháráma, at the invitation of the king, who obtained for him copies of the Chronicle from Siam (Cv.xcix.78f; Cv.Trs.ii.263, n.1). From there it was continued till the time of the British occupation (1815 A.C.) by Hikkaduve Sumangala Thera (P.L.C.310).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a Commentary on the Mahávamsa called the Vamsatthappakásiní (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásála Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahásála Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A rich brahmin asks the Buddha why there is an apparent decrease of human beings. The Buddha answers that it is because the world is ablaze with unlawful lusts, wrong doctrines, and depraved longings. There is no reasonable rain, harvests are poor, and men die easily. A.i.159f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahásála or Lúkhapápurana Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A wealthy brahmin, looking worn and wearing a coarse garment, visits the Buddha at Sávatthi and tells him that his four sons, aided by their wives, have shown him the door. The Buddha teaches him several verses illustrating the ingratitude of his sons to be recited in the Santhágárasálá. He recited these and his sons, who are in the assembly, take him home and look after him. Later he goes to the Buddha and asks him to accept a set of garments which his sons have given him. The Buddha accepts it out of compassion (S.i.175f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says that the man had immense wealth in his house, some eighty crores. He found wives for his sons and divided half his wealth among them. His wife died, and his sons, fearful lest he should marry again and they should lose the rest of their patrimony, pet him and look after him, and he gives them all except his wrap. He goes to live with his eldest son, but is driven out by his daughter in law; the rest of the family treats him likewise. He enters the order of the Pandarangas and suffers the greatest privations, till he finally throws himself on the reputed kindness and graciousness of the Buddha. When the people discover the disloyalty of the sons they threaten to kill them, and then the sons take the old man back and nurse him. Later the members of the family become sotápannas.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásammata&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A king who lived in the beginning of this present age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Páli Chronicles (Mhv.ii.1ff.; Dpv.iii.1ff.; MT. 122ff.; also J.ii.311; iii.454, etc.) mention him as the original ancestor of the Sákiyan family, to which the Buddha belonged, and gives a list of the dynasties from his day to the time of the Buddha, to prove that the line was &quot;unbroken.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahásammata belonged to the Solar Race and is identified with the Bodhisatta, who was born among men after sojourn in the Brahma worlds (MT. 121 f). He was called Mahásammata, because, on the arising of wickedness in the world, he was chosen by the people (sannipatitvá samaggajátehi mahájanchi sammannitvá kato Mahásammato; MT.122; cp. D.iii.92f.; Mtu.i.248; DhSA. 390, 392) to show indignation against and disapproval of those worthy of blame. In return for his services, he was given a portion of their harvest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (J.iv.192) that in the dynasty of Mahásammata the idea of meting out punishments, such as torture, fining, expulsion, was unknown. These were invented later &lt;b&gt;with the advance of civilisation!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vimánavatthu Commentary (p.15) explains that Mahásammata is the name given in the sacred books (sásane) for Manu. Some, at least, of the Ceylon kings traced their descent from Mahásammata. See, e.g., Cv.xlvii.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the king came to know this, he consulted various people, and, acting on their advice, had a pond dug to the north of the city in the hope of enticing a golden hamsa there, and appointed a fowler, who came to be called Khemaka, to look after the pond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan succeeded. Five different kinds of geese came: the grass geese, the yellow geese, the scarlet geese, the white geese, and the páka geese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhatarattha, king of the golden geese, who lived in Cittakúta, had taken as wife a paká goose, and at the repeated suggestion of his minister, Sumukha, arrived with his flock of ninety thousand, to see the wonderful pond at Benares. Khemaka saw them and waited his opportunity. On the seventh day he found it, and set a snare in which Dhatarattha was caught. At his cry of alarm the flock fled, with the exception of Sumukha, who stayed and asked Khemaka for permission to take Dhatarattha's place. When Sumukha heard why they had been caught, he asked that both he and Dhatarattha should be taken before Samyama. When Samyama heard of Sumukha's devotion he was greatly touched, and showed the hamsas every possible honour, after asking their forgiveness for the way they had been treated. Dhatarattha preached to the queen and the royal household, and, having exhorted the king to rule righteously, returned to Cittakúta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Ananda's attempt to sacrifice his own life for that of the Buddha, when Nálágiri (q.v.) was sent to kill him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khemaka was Channa, Khemá the Therí Khemá, the king Sáriputta, Sumukha Ananda, and Dhatarattha the Bodhisatta.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá Ummagga Játaka (No. 546)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born in Mithilá as the son of Sirivaddhaka and Sumanádevi. The child was born with a medicinal plant in his hand, and was therefore called Mahosadha. He talked immediately after birth, and it is said that, on the day of his conception, Videha, king of Mithilá, dreamed a dream, which presaged the birth of a sage. From early childhood Mahosadha gave evidence of unusual ability, and one of his first acts was to build a large hall and lay out a garden with the help of his companions. The king wished to have him in the court though he was only seven years old, but was dissuaded by his wise men. But he sent a councillor to watch the boy and report of his doings from time to time. When the king was fully convinced (the Játaka gives an account of nineteen problems solved by Mahosadha) that Mahosadha was undoubtedly endowed with unusual wisdom, he sent for him in spite of the counsel of his ministers -  Senaka, Pukkusa, Kávínda and Devinda-  and appointed him as his fifth councillor. One day, Mahosadha saved the queen Udumbará (q.v.) from the unjust wrath of the king, and ever after she was his firm and loyal friend. After his entry into the court, Mahosadha was on many occasions called upon to match his wit against that of the senior councillors, and on each occasion he emerged triumphant. E.g., in the Mendakapañha (q.v.) and the Sirimandapañha (q.v.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When aged sixteen he married Amarádeví. She was a wise woman, and frustrated many attempts of Mahosadha's enemies to embroil him with the king. Once they stole various things from the palace and sent them to her. She accepted them, and made assignations with each of the donors. When they arrived she had them seized, their heads shaved, and themselves thrown into the </data>
<data>jakes, where she tormented them, and then arraigned them before the king with the stolen goods. Mahosadha, aware of the plots against him, lay in hiding, and the deity of the king's parasol put several questions to the king, knowing that none but Mahosadha could answer them. The king sent men to seek him, and he was discovered working for a potter. The king showed him all honour, and obtained from him the answers to the deity's questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his enemies continued to plot against him, until orders were given by the king that he should be killed the next day. Udumbará, discovered this and warned him. But in the meantime he had discovered the guilty secrets of his enemies: Senaka had killed a courtesan, Pukkusa had a leprous spot on his thigh, Kávinda was possessed by a yakkha named Naradeva, and Devinda had stolen the king's most precious gem. Mahosadha posted these facts everywhere in the city, and the next day went boldly into the palace. The king professed innocence of any evil intentions against him; but Mahosadha exposed the schemes of them all, and Senaka and the others were only saved from severe punishment by the intervention of Mahosadha himself. Thenceforward Mahosadha was Videha's trusted councillor, and took various measures to increase his royal master's power and glory. Spies were sent to every court, whence they brought home reports. Mahosadha also had a parrot whom he employed to ferret out the most baffling secrets. While returning from a visit to Sankhapala, king of Ekabala, the parrot passed through Uttarapañcála and there overheard a conversation between Cúlani Brahmadatta, king of Kampilla, and his purohita Kevatta, wherein the latter unfolded a scheme for capturing the whole of Jambudípa. Kevatta was too wise to allow Brahmadatta, to attack Mithilá, knowing of Mahosadha's power, but Mahosadha deliberately provoked Brahmadatta by sending his men to upset a </data>
<data>feast he had prepared, during which he had planned to poison the hundred princes whom he had brought under subjection. Brahmadatta then set out to attack Mithilá. He laid siege to the city, and adopted various ways of compelling the citizens to surrender. But Mahosadha was more than a match for him, and found means of defeating all his plans. In the end Mahosadha engaged the services of Anukevatta, who, pretending to be a traitor to Mithilá, went over to the army of Brahmadatta and, gaining the king's confidence, informed him that Kevatta and all the other counsellors of Brahmadatta had accepted bribes from Mahosadha. The king listened to him, and on his advice raised the siege and fled to his own city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kevatta planned revenge, and, a year later, he persuaded Brahmadatta to send poets to Videha's city, singing songs of the peerless beauty of the daughter of Brahmadatta, Pañcálacandí. Videha heard the songs and sent a proposal of marriage, and Kevatta came to Mithilá to arrange the day. Videha suggested that Kevatta should meet Mahosadha to discuss the plans, but Mahosadha feigned illness, and when Kevatta arrived at his house, he was grossly insulted by Mahosadha's men. When Kevatta had left, Videha consulted Mahosadha, but would not be dissuaded from his plan to marry Pañcálacandí. Finding that he could do nothing with the king, Mahosadha sent his parrot Matthara to find out what he could from the maynah bird which lived in Brahmadatta's bedchamber. Matthara used all his wits and won the favour of the maynah and learnt from her of Kevatta's plan, which he repeated to Mahosadha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Videha's leave, Mahosadha went on Uttarapañcála to, as he said, make preparations for the wedding. But he gave orders for a village to be built on every league of ground along the road, and gave instructions to the shipwright, Anandakumára, to build and hold ready three hundred ships. At </data>
<data>Uttarapañcála he was received with great honour, and obtained the king's permission to build in the city a palace for Videha. The king gave him a free hand, and be immediately started to threaten to pull down houses belonging to various people, from the queen mother downwards, and obtained money from them as bribes to spare their houses. Having reported to the king that no suitable spot was available within the city, he obtained his consent to erect a palace outside the city, between that and the Ganges. All access was forbidden to the site on penalty of a large sum, and having first erected a village called Gaggali for his workmen, elephants, etc., Mahosadha started to dig a tunnel, the mouth of which was in the Ganges. The tunnel, a marvellous place, was duly constructed, fitted with all manner of machinery, and beautifully decorated. A smaller tunnel was dug, leading into the larger, one opening, which was, however, concealed, giving access to the king's palace. The task occupied four months, and when all preparations were complete, Mahosadha sent word to Videha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videha arrived at Brahmadatta's court, and a great feast was held in his honour at Upakárí, the palace which had been prepared for his residence. While the feast was in progress, Mahosadha sent men by the smaller tunnel to the palace and bade them fetch Talatá (the queen mother), the queen Nandá, and Pañcálacandí, on the pretext that they had been sent for by Brahmadatta to take part in the festivities as Videha and Mahosadha had both been killed, according to plan. Meanwhile Brahmadatta had given orders that the whole city should be surrounded. Videha was overcome with fright on discovering what was happening, but he put himself into Mahosadha's hands. The latter led him into the large tunnel, and there he was brought face to face with the members of Brahmadatta's family, who had already been conducted thither. </data>

On emerging from the tunnel, they were placed on board a waiting ship, with Tálatá and Nandá, and sent away into safety, escorted by the other ships, Mahosadha himself remaining behind in Uttarapañcála.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, Brahmadatta came with his army to Upakári, hoping to capture Videha. There Mahosadha revealed to him what had happened, and, in due course, persuaded him to forget his wrath and inspect the tunnel. While in the tunnel Brahmadatta expressed his remorse for having listened to the evil advice of Brahmadatta, and he and Mahosadha swore eternal friendship. Mahosadha returned to Mithilá, taking with him Brahmadatta's dowry for his daughter; the members of Brahmadatta's family returned to Uttarapañcála, and the two kings lived in great amity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videha died ten years later, and in fulfilment of a promise made to Brahmadatta, Mahosadha went to Uttarapañcála. There Nandá, who had never forgiven him, tried to poison the king's mind against him; but this plot was frustrated by a religious woman, Bherí (q.v.), and Brahmadatta remained his firm friend, loving him, as he confessed to Bheri, more than any of his own family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka was related to illustrate the Buddha's great wisdom.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Uppalavanná is identified with Bherí,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Suddhodana with Sirivaddhaka,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahamáyá with Sumanádeví,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Bimbádeví with Amará,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ananda with Matthara,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sáriputta with Cúlani Brahmadatta,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Devadatta with Kevatta,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Culla Nandiká with Talatá,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sundarí with Pañcálacandí,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Yasassiká with Nandí,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ambattha with Kávinda, </data>

Mahápáli.&lt;/b&gt; A refectory built by Devánampiyatissa Anurádhapura, for the use of the monks (Mhv.xx.23). Various kings provided special food to be distributed there -  e.g., Upatissa II., who sent food prepared for him in the palace (Cv.xxxvii.181; so did King Silákála, Cv.xli.28), and himself ate of the food left over after the distribution (Cv.xxxvii.203).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahánáma enlarged the building (Cv.xxxvii.211), as did Silámeghavana (Cv.xliv.65) and Udaya II (Cv.li.132).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhátusena instituted distribution of rice (Cv.xxxviii.41), while Aggabodhi II. added to the hall and set up a stone canoe (bhattanávam) for the distribution of rice (Cv.xlii.67; Aggabodhi I. had already given a canoe of bronze, Cv.xlii.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his victory, Kassapa II., by way of celebration, held a special almsgiving at the Mahápáli (Cv.xlv.1). Dáthopatissa II. distributed there clothing, rice, sour milk, milk and milk rice on uposatha days (Cv.xlv.25). Mahinda I. gave ten cartloads of food (Cv.xlviii.34), and Aggabodhi IX. distributed daily an amount of rice equal in weight to his own body (Cv.lxix.78). The Coliyans burnt down the building, and the last we hear of it is its restoration by Mahinda IV. (Cv.liv.45).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

(Mhv.ii.17ff.; elsewhere her father is called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha')"&gt;Mahá Suppabuddha &lt;/a&gt;(ThigA.141), while the Apadána (ii.538) gives the name of her mother as Sulakkhaná).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandapaanii')"&gt;Dandapáni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; were her brothers, and &lt;a href="mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Mahá Pajápatí&lt;/a&gt; her sister. Both the sisters were married to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt; in their youth, but it was not till Máyá was between forty and fifty that the Buddha was born (Vibhá.278). She had all the qualities necessary for one who was to bear the exalted rank of being the mother of the Buddha: she was not too passionate, she did not take intoxicants, she had practiced the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/n_r/paramii')"&gt;páramí&lt;/a&gt; for one hundred thousand kappas, and had not, since her birth, violated the five &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/siila')"&gt;sílá&lt;/a&gt;. On the day of her conception she kept her fast, and in her sleep that night she had the following dream: the four Mahárája gods took her in her bed to Himavá and placed her under a sála tree on Manosilátala. Then their wives came and bathed her in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anotatta')"&gt;Anotatta Lake&lt;/a&gt; and clad her in divine robes. They then led her into a golden </data>
<data>palace and laid her on a divine couch; there the Bodhisatta, in the form of a white elephant, holding a white lotus in his gleaming trunk, entered into her right side. This was on the day of the Uttarásálhanakkhatta, after a festival lasting seven days, in which she had already taken part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the day of her conception she was guarded by the Four Regent Gods; she felt no desire for men, and the child in her womb could be seen from outside. At the end of the tenth month she wished to return to her people in Devadaha, but, on her way thither, she stopped at the sála grove in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lumbini')"&gt;Lumbiní&lt;/a&gt; and there her child was born as she stood holding on to the branch of a sála tree (J.i.49ff). Seven days later Máyá died and was reborn as a male in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tusita')"&gt;Tusita&lt;/a&gt; world, under the name of Máyádevaputta (Thag.vss.533f.; ThagA.i.502).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha visited &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt; immediately after the performance of the Twin Miracle at the foot of the Gandamba tree, on the full moon day of Ásálha, and there, during the three months of the rainy season, the Buddha stayed, preaching the Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother (who came there to listen to him), seated on Sakka's Pandukambalasilásana, at the foot of the Páricchattaka tree. (It is said that, during this time, at certain intervals, the Buddha would return to earth, leaving a seated image of himself in Távatimsa to continue the preaching while he attended to his bodily needs, begging alms in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarakuru')"&gt;Uttarakuru&lt;/a&gt; and eating his food on the banks of Anotatta, where &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; waited on him and learnt of what he had been preaching to the devas.) (DhSA.i.15; DhA.iii.216f)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (UdA.276f ) state the view, held by some, </data>
<data>that had Máyá been alive the Buddha would not have shown such reluctance to bestow ordination on women. This view, says &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala')"&gt;Dhammapála&lt;/a&gt; is erroneous. It would have made no difference, for it is the dhammatá of all Buddhas that women shall be ordained, but subject to certain important restrictions. The mothers of all Buddhas die very soon after the birth of their son, because no other child is fit to be conceived in the same womb as a Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Máyá is mentioned in several Játakas as the mother of the Bodhisatta -  e.g., in  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aliinacitta_jat_156')"&gt;the Alínacitta, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/katthahaari_jak_7')"&gt;the Katthahári, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurudhamma_jat_276')"&gt;the Kurudhamma, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii_jat_428')"&gt;the Kosambí, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khandahaala_jat_542')"&gt;the Khandahála, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dasaratha_jat_461')"&gt;the Dasaratha, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bandhanagara_jat_201')"&gt;the Bandhanágára, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mahaummagga_jat_546')"&gt;the Maháummagga, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maatuposaka_jat_455')"&gt;the Mátuposaka, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara_jat_547')"&gt;the Vessantara, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima_jat163_411')"&gt;the Susíma, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somanassa_jat_505')"&gt;the Somanassa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthipala_jat_509')"&gt;the Hatthipála. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to some contexts, after her birth as Phusatí in the Vessantara Játaka, </data>
<data>Máyá became one of the daughters of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kikii')"&gt;King Kikí&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Máyá's resolve to be the mother of a Buddha was formed ninety one kappas ago in the time of Vipassí Buddha (J.vi.480f). She was then the elder daughter of King Bandhumá. One of the king's vassals sent him a piece of priceless sandalwood and a golden wreath, worth one hundred thousand. The sandalwood the king gave to his elder daughter and the wreath to the younger. The elder powdered the sandalwood and took it in a golden casket to the Buddha. Some of the powder she offered to the Buddha to be rubbed on his body, and the rest she scattered in his cell. It was the sight of the Buddha's golden body that inspired her with the desire to be the mother of such a being. Her sister later became &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uracchadaa')"&gt;Uracchadá&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

King Vasabha went to the monastery, as the monk lay dying, intending to worship him, but at the door he heard the groans of the ill man, and disgusted that, after sixty years of monastic life, he should not be able to conquer his pain, he did not enter. This was reported to the Elder, and putting forth great effort, he subdued his pain and sent word to the king to come to him. Vasabha entered, and prostrating himself before the Elder, said, &quot;I worship you, not for your arahantship, but for the exertion you put forth while yet a puthujjana.&quot; DA.i.291.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásakuludáyí Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha visits the hermitage of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakuladaayii')"&gt;Sakuludáyí&lt;/a&gt; near Rájagaha. Sakuludáyi tells him that the Buddha, unlike other religious teachers, is honoured by his disciples, and gives it as his opinion that this is because the Buddha eats sparingly, is content with any raiment, accepts any alms, is satisfied with any lodging, lives in seclusion, and counsels others to do likewise. The Buddha answers that if the esteem shown him depends on these qualities, he has numerous disciples more austere than himself with regard to these practices, and gives five other qualities which have won for him esteem: he has the higher virtues, outstandingly keen vision, super eminent intellect, he teaches his disciples the Noble Truths, and shows them the way in which to develop the four &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/satipatthaana')"&gt;satipatthána&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has taught them, besides,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/dic3_s')"&gt;sammá-ppadhána&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the four &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/iddhi_paada')"&gt;iddhi-páda&lt;/a&gt;,    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the five &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/indriya')"&gt;indriyas&lt;/a&gt;,    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the five &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/b_f/bala')"&gt;bala&lt;/a&gt;,    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the seven &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/b_f/bojjhanga')"&gt;bojjhangas&lt;/a&gt;,   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Noble Eightfold Path, (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/magga')"&gt;magga&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the eight Deliverances (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/u_v/vimokkha')"&gt;vimokkha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;,   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the eight spheres of mastery (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/a/abhibhayatana')"&gt;abhibháyatamas&lt;/a&gt;),  &lt;/li&gt;</data>

He worked in a rice field, disguised as a labourer, and with the wages so earned gave alms to Mahásumma. For three years he laboured in a sugar mill near Sonnagiri and built the viháras known as Mandavápi, Abhayagallaka, Vankávattakagalla, Díghabáhugallaka, and Jálagáma. He was succeeded by Coranága (Mhv.xxxiv.1ff). Mahácúla had two sons, Tissa (poisoned by the notorious Anulá) and Kutakannatissa. Mhv.xxxiv.15, 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahákanha Játaka (No. 469)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, when the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were already forgotten, there ruled a king named Usínara. Monks and nuns lived in wickedness, and men followed evil paths, being born, after death, in the Niraya. Sakka, finding no one entering the deva worlds from among men, decided to scare the men into virtue. Assuming the guise of a forester and leading Mátali disguised as a black fierce looking dog called Mahákanha, Sakka came to the city gates and cried aloud that the world was doomed to destruction. The people fled in terror into the city and the gates were shut. But the forester leapt over the city wall with his dog, the latter scaring everyone he saw. The king shut himself up in his palace, but the dog put his forefeet on the palace window and set up a roar, which was heard from the hells to the highest heavens. The forester said the dog was hungry, and the king ordered food to be given him. But he ate it all in one mouthful and roared for more. Usínara then asked the forester what kind of dog it was, and was told that the animal ate up all those who walked in unrighteousness, and described who the unrighteous were. Then having terrified everyone, Sakka revealed himself and returned to his heaven. The king and his people became virtuous, and Kassapa's religion lasted for one thousand years more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a conversation among the monks to the effect that the Buddha was always working for the good of others, never resting, never tiring, his compassion extended towards all beings. Mátali is identified with Ananda (J.iv.180 6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barking of Mahákanha was among the four sounds heard throughout Jambudípa. SNA.i.223; see J.iv.182, where only three are mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When he was ill, thirty thousand monks of great power came to minister to him. The king of the Nágas was also present, and as he offered rice gruel to the Elder, the king of the Supannas dashed across the sky to seize him. But Buddharakkhita created a mountain, into which he made the Elder and the Nága enter. Vsm.155, 375; DhSA.187.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahávácakála&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man who lived on the banks of the Maháválukagangá. For thirty years he meditated on the thirty two impurities of the body in the hope of becoming a sotápanna. But at the end of that period he gave up his meditations, renouncing the Buddha's Doctrine as futile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death he was born as a crocodile in the river, and one day sixty carts laden with stone pillars started crossing the river at Kacchakatittha. The crocodile ate bulls, carts, and pillars. AA.i.367.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He then goes on to explain that dukkha consists of the five upádánakkhandhas   visible shapes, feelings, perception, sankháras and consciousness. The constituents of these attachments are the four principle elements: earth, water, fire, and air. Each element is of two kinds personal (ajjhatta) and external (bahiddhá) - and each is transient and subject to decay. The chain of causation entails all that makes up the five attachments. Where there is eye intact, on which external shapes come to focus, and where there is developed pertinent material to sustain it, there is developed a manifestation of the pertinent section of consciousness. Thus arises the upádánakkhandha of form; similarly with the others. M.i.184 91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahámeghavana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahámeghavana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A park to the south of Anurádhapura. Between the park and the city lay Nandana or Jotivana. The park was laid out by Mutasíva, and was so called because at the time the spot was chosen for a garden, a great cloud, gathering at an unusual time, poured forth rain (Mhv.xi.2f). Devánampiyatissa gave the park to Mahinda for the use of the Order (Mhv.xv.8, 24; Dpv.xviii.18; Sp.i.81) and within its boundaries there came into being later the Mahá-Vihára and its surrounding buildings. The fifteenth chapter of the Mahávamsa (Mhv.xv.27ff) gives a list of the chief spots associated with the religion, which came into existence there. Chief among these are the sites of the Bodhi tree, the thirty two málakas, the Catussálá, the Mahá Thúpa, the Thúpáráma, the Lohapásáda, and various parivenas connected with Mahinda: Sunháta, Díghacankamana, Phalagga, Therápassaya, Marugana and Díghasandasenápati. Later, the Abhayagíri vihára and the Jetavanáráma were also erected there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahámeghavana was visited by Gotama Buddha (Mhv.i.80; Dpv.ii.61, 64), and also by the three Buddhas previous to him. In the time of Kakusandha it was known as Mahátittha, in that of Konagamana as Mahánoma, and in that of Kassapa as Maháságara (Mhv.xv.58, 92, 126). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahámeghavana was also called the Tissáráma, and on the day it was gifted to the Sangha, Mahinda scattered flowers on eight spots contained in it, destined for future buildings, and the earth quaked eight times (Mhv.xv.174). This was on the day of Mahinda's arrival in Anurádhapura. The first building to be erected in the Mahámeghavana was the Kálapásáda parivena (q.v.) for the use of Mahinda. In order to hurry on the work, bricks used in the building were dried with torches (Mhv.xv.203). The boundary of the Mahámeghavana </data>
<data>probably coincided with the símá of the Mahávihára, but it was later altered by Kanitthatissa, when he built the Dakkhina vihára.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahására Játaka (No. 92)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once minister of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. One day the king went with his queens to the park and the latter took off their ornaments for bathing. A female monkey, watching her opportunity, stole a pearl necklace. On the loss being discovered, the king had every person and every place searched. A rustic, seeing the commotion, took to his heels and was chased and captured by the guards. When questioned, he confessed to having stolen the necklace, thinking that the best way of saving his life, and said he had given it to the Treasurer. The Treasurer said he had given it to the chaplain, the chaplain to the chief musician, the musician to the courtesan. As it was by this time late, the matter was put off till the next day, the alleged accomplices being imprisoned. The Bodhisatta, doubting their words, obtained the king's leave to investigate the matter. He had the prisoners watched, and knew, from their reported conversations, that they were innocent. He then decided that it had been stolen by a monkey, and gave orders that a number of monkeys should be captured and turned loose again with strings of beads round their necks, wrists, and ankles. The monkey, who had stolen the necklace, on seeing the others with their beads, was filled with jealousy and produced the necklace. The guard frightened her, and so she dropped it, and the Bodhisatta was greatly praised for his wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Ananda. Pasenadi's wives wished for someone to preach to them in the palace. Pasenadi went to the Buddha and from him heard the praises of Chattapání. Later, he met him and asked him to preach in his harem. But Chattapání was unwilling, saying that it was the prerogative of the monks. Thereupon the king asked the Buddha to appoint someone, and the Buddha appointed Ananda. One day Ananda found all the women of </data>
<data>the palace very dejected, and learnt that the jewel of the king's turban had been lost and everyone was most distracted. Ananda, therefore, went to the king and asked that each suspect should be given a wisp of straw on a lump of clay and asked to place it somewhere, the idea being that the thief would leave the jewel in one of these lumps. The ruse, however, did not succeed, and orders were then given that a water pot be set in a retired corner of the courtyard behind a screen and that everyone should be asked to wash his hands. When all had washed, the pot was emptied and the jewel found inside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with the king of the Játaka. J.i.381 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The path to the destruction of these bonds is the cultivation of the jhánas (M.i.432&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta is so called because it was preached in contradiction of a wrong answer given by Málunkyáputta to a question of the Buddha. The Buddha pointed out his error, and Ananda requested the Buddha to give the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the suttas which teach samatha-vipassaná.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásíva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahásíva.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon; he was the son of Mutasíva and the younger brother of Uttiya, whom he succeeded. He reigned for ten years (197 87 B.C.) and built the Nagarangana vihára for Bhaddasála Thera. He was succeeded by Súratissa. Mhv.xxi.1ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahásíva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Resident of Vámantapabbhára. He was among the last of the arahants, and had taken part in various assemblies led by the Bodhisatta (J.iv.490; vi. 30). It is probably this Thera who is referred to as &lt;b&gt;Gámantapabbháravásí&lt;/b&gt; Mahásíva in the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.24, 29). He lived in Tissamaháráma at Mahágáma, and was the teacher of eighteen groups of monks. One of his pupils became an arahant, and, being aware that his teacher was yet a puthujjana, went to him and asked his leave to be taught a stanza. But Mahásíva said his pupils were so numerous that he had no time to give him a stanza. The pupil waited for a whole day and night, and then getting no chance of learning, said, &quot;If you are so busy now how will you find time to die?&quot; Mahásíva heard and understood, and exerted himself strenuously for thirty long years, at the end of which time he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahásíva.&lt;/b&gt; A famous Commentator, sometimes called Díghabhánaka Mahásíva. His interpretations are quoted, with respect, in the Commentaries. E.g., DA.ii.430, 511, 543, 554, 805, 881, 883; SA.iii.171, 198; Sp.iii.711; DhSA. 405; PSA. 80; AA.ii.490.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahásíva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An incumbent of Bhátivanka, during the reign of Dutthagámaní. One day he went to worship at the Mahá Thúpa, and there he saw two devatás offering flowers. In their previous lives they were two women who had worked for hire on the Mahá Thúpa. Mhv.xxx.46ff.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahásíva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Nigrodhapitthi and expert in the Tipitaka. Once, while preaching the Síhanáda Sutta in King Vasabha's palace, he described the splendours of the Relic Chamber in the Mahá Thúpa and the king expressed some difficulty in believing the report, but the Elder was able to convince the king that nothing was impossible where there was a combination of rájiddhi, deviddhi and ariyiddhi. The king was pleased, conveyed the Elder under the white umbrella to the Mahá Vihára and made great offerings, lasting for seven days, to the Mahá Thúpa. MT. 555.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Mahásíva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Mentioned as an eminent teacher of the Vinaya (Vin.v.3; Sp.i.63). He is probably identical with one of the foregoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Mahásíva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; It was for him that Aggabodhi I. built a parivena and also the Kurunda vihára with a tank and a grove of coco palms. Cv.xlii.11, 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá Kammavibhanga Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potaliputta comes to Samiddhi in his forest hut, near Veluvana in Rájagaha, and tells him that the Buddha has declared that all one says or does is vain; the only thing of importance is that which passes in one's mind. Samiddhi protests against this, and when Potaliputta says, &quot;Tell me, what does a man experience who acts of set purpose?&quot; gives his own explanation. Potaliputta then goes away without further talk and seeks Ananda, to whom he reports the incident. Ananda takes him to the Buddha, remarking that Samiddhi should not have given a single direct reply to a question, which required careful qualifications in the answer. Láludáyi interrupts and is rebuked by the Buddha, who explains that the question was essentially a triple one and should have been so answered. If a man's purposeful act is calculated to produce a pleasant feeling, his experience is pleasant; if an unpleasant feeling, unpleasant; if neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it is neither. Ananda asks him to explain further, and this he does. A man may be wicked in this world and yet, at death, pass either into heaven or into hell, he may be good yet go into hell or into heaven. But one should not rush to conclusions from this truth, because the consequence of man's action, good or bad, may be felt either here and now, in the next birth, or at some other time. Kamma can be divided into four classes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) not only in operation, but also having the   appearance of being so; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) in operation, though not appearing so; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) in operation, and appearing so; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) not in operation, and not appearing so.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásaccaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccaka visits the Buddha at the Kútágárasálá and questions him on the disciplining of the body and the mind. The Buddha describes to him the training he underwent from the time of leaving the world to that of his Enlightenment, stopping at no exertion, avoiding no austerities till, in the end, wisdom came to him, and he realized that bliss could not be experienced with an emaciated body. The Pañcavaggiyas, who had been with him till then, left him in disgust. But he persevered, and, in the end, destroyed the ásavas. Saccaka, addressed in the sutta as Aggivessana, expresses great admiration for the Buddha and acknowledges his superiority over other teachers.

But the latter refused on the plea of the wickedness of the monk possessing this knowledge; but in the end he acquiesced, on condition that Mahápitaka himself would be present at the lessons.

Mahátissa perceived only the radiance of the devas and questioned Phussadeva,   who did not, however, give a direct answer. SNA.i.55f.; Vibhá.352.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

Mahátissa Thera. &lt;/b&gt;He lived in Cetiyagiri, and   one day, while on his way to Anurádhapura, saw a woman who was leaving her   husband, having quarrelled with him. She was beautifully dressed, and seeing   the Elder, smiled at him, in order to show her perfect teeth. The Elder looked   at her, and acquiring the perception of &quot;the foul&quot; through thinking of the   bones of her teeth, became an arahant.

The Elder replied, &quot;I know not if it was man or   woman, but I saw a lump of bones.&quot; Vsm.20f., 194.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahátissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Of Punnavallika. One full   moon day, at evening, he went to the courtyard of the Mahá Thúpa, saw the   moonlight, and turning towards the shrine, entered into rapture, the Buddha </data>

He was an arahant, and   heard, with his divine ear, the description given in the Lohapásáda by   Cittagutta Thera of the marvels of the Mahá Thúpa. Mahátissa told Cittagutta   that the description was not full enough. MT. 552f.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Mahátissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Kambugallaka   Vihára. He was a colleague of Kupikkala Mahátissa, and interceded on behalf of   Vattagámaní when that king's ministers wished to leave him. Later, the   ministers appointed him to look after all the monasteries built by them.   Mhv.xxxiii.76, 89ff.; MT. 619, 622.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Mahátissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Kupikkala   Vihára. When Vattagámaní was in hiding in the forest of Vessagiri, the Elder </data>
<data>  once provided him with a meal, and the king, out of gratitude, made him a   grant of land (Mhv.xxxiii.49). Later, the ministers wanted to revolt against   the king on account of his cruelty to Tanasíva, but the Elder and his   colleague Mahátissa from Kambugallaka, prevented them from doing so   (Mhv.xxxiii.76). When Vattagámaní built the Abhayagiri Vihára, he gave it into   the charge of Mahátissa. Mhv.xxxiii.83.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Mahátissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An incumbent of the   Mahávihára. He was expelled by reason of his association with families. His   pupil Bahalamassutissa thereupon seceded from the Mahávihára and established a   new sect in Abhayagiri. Mhv.xxxiii.95ff.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Mahátissa Thera. &lt;/b&gt;Incumbent of Anuráráma.   Voháríka Tissa was so pleased with him that he ordered alms to be regularly   given to him in the Mucelapattana. Mhv.xxxvi.30.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Mahátissa Thera. &lt;/b&gt;  Even when sixty years old he did not realize that he was a puthujjana. Then,   one day, his pupil Dhammadinna of Talangara came to him, asking for his   company in a journey to Tissamahá-vihára, where he had been asked to preach.   Mahátissa greeted him, and in the course of conversation, Dhammadinna   discovered that his teacher was under the false impression that he was an   arahant. Wishing to show him his error, he persuaded Mahátissa, by his iddhi   power, to create a pond, and in the pond a lotus, which a young girl was   picking. At the sight of the girl, Mahátissa was possessed by lust, and   realized that he was no arahant. Dhammadinna withdrew, and that same day   Mahátissa put forth effort and attained arahantship. AA.i.25.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Mahátissa.&lt;/b&gt; An incumbent of Cittalapabbata.   He was troubled by lustful thoughts and consulted his teacher. The Thera asked   him to prepare a cell for him, which he did with great care. The Thera then </data>
<data>  asked him to occupy it for one night, since he had taken so much trouble over   it. That night Mahátissa put forth effort and became an arahant. AA.i.26.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahávihára&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great monastery at Anurádhapura, for many centuries the chief seat of Buddhism in Ceylon. It was founded by Devánampiyatissa, on the counsel of Mahinda, and included the Mahámeghavana. The Mahámeghavanáráma henceforth came to be included in the Mahávihára. The boundary of the vihára was marked out by the king ploughing a circular furrow starting from near the Gangalatittha on the Kadambanadí and ending again at the river (Mhv.xv.188ff.; MT.361; Mbv. 135, 136 says that the ford on the Kadambanadí was Pásánatittha).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list is given in the Mahábodhivamsa (pp. 135f) of the places through which the simá (boundary) of the Mahávihára passed -  Pásánatittha, Kuddavátakapásána, Kumbhakáraáváta, the Mahánípa tree, Kakudhapáli, Maháangana tree, Khujjamátula tree, Marutta pokkharaní, the northern gate of the Vijayáráma park, Gajakumbhakapásána, then passing Avattimajjha, Bálakapásána on the Abhayavápi, Mahásusána, Díghapásána, the left side of Candalagáma, the Nícasusána to the left of Kammáradeva Símánigrodha, Veluvangana, round the hermitages of the Niganthas Jotiya Giri and Kumbhanda, to the right of the various hermitages of the Paribbájakas, by Hiyagalla, along the shrine of the brahmin Díyavása, through Telumapáli, Tálacatukka, to the right of the stables (assamandala), on to Sasakapásána and Marumbatittha. It then proceeded up the river to Síhasinánatittha, on to Pásánatittha, ending at Kuddavátakapásána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávihára contained thirty two Málakas (Mhv.xv.214) and had numerous buildings attached to it, apart from sacred shrines, such as the Mahábodhi tree, Thúpáráma, Mahá Thúpa, etc. In its early period, the precincts of the Mahávihára contained other buildings besides those dedicated to the service of Buddhism   e.g., the hermitages of the Niganthas and the Paribbájakas (as mentioned above) and the shrine of the guardian deity of </data>
<data>Anurádhapura (Mhv.xxv.87). In the time of Vattagámaní, the Mahávihára monks divided into two factions, and one party occupied Abhayagiri, built by the king (Mhv.xxxiii.97f). At first the differences between these two factions were trivial, but, as time went on, Abhayagiri grew in power and riches and proved a formidable rival to the older monastery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From time to time various kings and nobles made additions and restorations to the Mahávihára. Thus Vasabha (Mhv.xxxxv.88) built a row of cells, and Bhátikatissa erected a boundary wall (Mhv.xxxvi.2), while Kanitthatissa removed the boundary wall and constructed the Kukkutagiri parivena, twelve large pásádas, a refectory, and a road leading from Mahávihára to Dakkhinavihára (Mhv.xxxvi.10f). Vohárikatissa appointed a monthly gift of a thousand to the monks of Mahávihára (Mhv.xxxvi.32), while Sirisanghabodhi built a saláka house (Mhv.xxxvi.74). Gothábhaya erected a stone pavilion and made a padhánabhúmi to the west of the vihára (Mhv.xxxvi.102,106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the latter part of Gothábhaya's reign, a dispute arose between the Mahávihára and Abhayagiri on matters of doctrine, and sixty monks of Abhayagiri, who had adopted the Vetulyaváda, were banished. They obtained the assistance of a Cola monk, named Sanghatissa, and at a solemn assembly of the monks concerned, at Thúpáráma, Sanghamitta expounded his heretical doctrine, refuting the opposition of the Mahávihára monks, and succeeded in winning over the king, who was present, in spite of the efforts of his uncle, Gothábhaya Thera, to bring him round to the orthodox party. Sanghamitta became tutor to the king's sons, and when one of these, Mahásena, became king, he prompted him to destroy the Mahávihára. A royal decree was issued forbidding the giving of alms to the Mahávihára. The monks thereupon left the monastery, and for nine years it remained deserted. Many of the buildings </data>
<data>were destroyed, and various possessions belonging to the Mahávihára were removed to Abhayagiri; but the people, led by the king's minister and friend, Meghavannábhaya, revolted against the impious deeds of Mahásena and his admirers, Sanghamitta and Sona, and the king was forced to yield. Sanghamitta and Sona were slain by one of the queens, and the king, with the help of Meghavannábhaya, rebuilt several parivenas and restored some of the possessions, which had been removed. But Mahásena's allegiance to the Mahávihára teaching was not lasting; acting on the advice of a monk named Tissa, he built the Jetavanavihára in the grounds of the Mahávihára, against the wish of the monks there; the latter left again for nine months as a sign of protest against the king's attempts to remove the boundary of the vihára. This attempt, however, he was forced to abandon (Mhv.xxxvi.110f.; xxxvii.1 37).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahásena's son, Sirimeghavanna, on coming to the throne, exerted himself to undo the damage which had been wrought by his father. He rebuilt the Lohapásáda and restored all the demolished parivenas, together with their endowments (Cv.xxxvii.54ff). Mahávihára had, by now, become famous as a seat of learning; it was the centre of Theraváda Buddhism, and was the repository of various Commentaries, of which the chief were the Síhalatthakathá on the Páli Canon. Thither, therefore, came scholars from various countries, among them Buddhaghosa (q.,v.), who resided in the Ganthákara parivena and compiled his Páli Commentaries (Cv.xxxvii.215ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dhátusena became king he had the walls of the Mahávihára painted with various ornamental designs (Cv.xxxviii.43). The Dhammarucikas seem to have been favourites of this king and to have occupied the Mahávihára, later moving to Ambatthala vihára (Cv.xxxviii.75). Mahánága instituted a permanent distribution of soup to the inhabitants of the Mahávihára </data>
<data>(Cv.xli.99) and Jetthatissa III. planted another Bodhi tree there, called the Mahámetta (Cv.xliv.96).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udaya I. built a new saláka hall (Cv.xlix.14). Aggabodhi IX. discontinued the habit of the monks of the smaller viháras surrounding Anurádhapura from coming to Mahávihára for their supply of medicines and made other arrangements for their distribution (Cv.xlix.88). Sena I. and his queen Sanghá erected and endowed the Sanghasena parivena (Cv.l.70), while Kassapa IV. built the Samuddagiri parivena and gave it for the use of the Pamsukúlikas, while for the forest dwelling monks of Mahávihára he built forest dwellings (Cv.lii.21f.; Cv. Trs.i.163, n.8). Kassapa's kinsman, the general Rakkha, built a vihára in the village of Saváraka and gave it to the incumbents of Mahávihára, to be used as a padhánaghara, while Mahálekhasena built, in Mahávihára itself, the Mahálekhapabbata (Cv.lii.31ff). Udaya IV. gave a diadem of jewels to the Buddha image in Mahávihára, while his wife Vidurá added to it a network of rays made of precious stones (Cv.liii.49ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the invasions of the Colas and the Pandus from South India, and owing to the consequent confusion prevailing in the country, the Mahávihára seems to have been neglected. Many of the buildings were destroyed and their priceless possessions plundered. Discipline among the monks became slack and there were many dissensions. Later, when Parakkamabáhu I. had restored peace, he wished to purify the religion, but met with great opposition, and it was only after strenuous efforts that he brought about a reconciliation between the different parties (Cv.lxxviii.11ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Cv.lxxviii.25) that the king could not find one single pure member of the Order. He, therefore, held a special ordination ceremony, admitting many monks into the Order.  &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;After the removal of the capital from Anurádhapura to Pulatthipura, Mahávihára lost its importance; the centre of activity was now at Pulatthipura, and later, at other capitals, and the Mahávihára fell into neglect and decay, from which it has never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He made a courtyard of kincikkha stones on plaster round the Mahá Thúpa, and built the Ambatthala thúpa, making it firm at the risk of his own life. He placed chairs for the preachers in all the viháras of Ceylon, and laid out the grounds round Cetiyagiri, holding a great celebration called the Giribhandapújá (q.v.). From the Kadambanadí to Cetiyagiri he laid carpets for the comfort of pilgrims. He built the Maninágapabbata, the Kalanda, the Samudda, and the Cúlánágapabbata Viháras, and gave land for the use of monks in Pásánadípaka and Mandavápi Viháras in gratitude for favours shown him by novices of these monasteries. He had two sons, Amandagámani Abhaya and Kanirajánutissa, both of whom succeeded to the throne.

Once, Tissa, brother   of Asoka, saw him seated at the foot of a tree meditating, fanned by a Nága   with a sála branch. Tissa was later ordained by him.

Tipitaka Cúlábhaya went to him from the Mahávihára in order   to learn from him the Doctrine. At the end of the teaching, Dhammarakkhita   asked Abhaya to give him a subject for meditation, for, he said, Abhaya had a   greater knowledge than he of that matter. The subject was given, and soon   after Dhammarakkhita attained Nibbána, and died while preaching at the   Lohapásáda. Vsm.96f.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

<data>&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá Kassapa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Buddha's most eminent disciples, chief among those who upheld minute observances of form (dhutavádánam) (A.i.23). He was born in the brahmin village of &lt;a href="mahatittha')"&gt;Mahátittha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;, and was the son of the brahmin&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapila')"&gt;Kapila&lt;/a&gt;, his mother being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumanadevi')"&gt;Sumanádeví&lt;/a&gt;; he himself was called Pippali. At Ap.ii.583, vs. 56; but there his father is called Kosiyagotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he grew up he refused to marry in spite of the wishes of his parents; but in the end, to escape from their importunities, he agreed to marry if a wife could be found resembling a statue, which he had made. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhadda_kapilani_thi')"&gt;Bhaddá Kápilání&lt;/a&gt; was found at Ságala to fulfil these conditions, and though the young people wrote to each other suggesting that somebody else should be found as a match for each, their letters were intercepted and they were married. By mutual consent, however, the marriage was not consummated, the two spending the night separated by a chain of flowers. Pippali had immense wealth; he used twelve measures of perfumed powder daily, each measure a Magadhanáli, for his person alone. He had sixty lakes with water works attached, and his workmen occupied fourteen villages, each as large as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura')"&gt;Anurádhapura&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day he went to a field, which was being ploughed and saw the birds eating the worms turned up by the plough. On being told that the sin therein was his, he decided to renounce all his possessions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Bhaddá had been watching the crows eating the little insects, which ran about </data>
<data>among the seamsum seeds that had been put out to dry, and when her attendant women told her that hers would be the sin for their loss of life, she also determined to renounce the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The husband and wife, finding that they were of one accord, took yellow raiments from their wardrobe, cut off each other's hair, took bowls in their hands, and passed out through their weeping servants, to all of whom they granted their freedom, and departed together, Pippali walking in front. But soon they agreed that it was not seemly they should walk thus together, as each must prove a hindrance to the other. And so, at the cross roads, he took the right and she the left and the earth trembled to see such virtue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, sitting in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt;, knew what the earthquake signified, and having walked three gávutas (this journey of the Buddha is often referred to -  e.g., MA.i.347, 357), sat down at the foot of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bahuputta')"&gt;Bahuputtaka Nigrodha&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa')"&gt;Nálandá&lt;/a&gt;, resplendent in all the glory of a Buddha. Pippali (henceforth called Mahá Kassapa, no explanation is to be found anywhere as to why he is called Kassapa; it was probably his gotta name, but see Ap.ii.583, vs.56) saw the Buddha, and recognising him at once as his teacher, prostrated himself before him. The Buddha told him to be seated, and, in three homilies, gave him his ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three homilies are given at S.ii.220, &quot;Thus Kassapa must thou train thyself: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) 'There shall be a lively sense of fear and regard (hirotappa)   towards all monks, seniors, novices, and those of middle status.' &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;(2) 'Whatever doctrine I shall hear bearing upon what   is good, to all that I will hearken with attentive ear, digesting it,   pondering it, gathering it all up with my will.' &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) 'Happy mindfulness with respect to the body shall   not be neglected by me.'&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they returned to Rájagaha, Kassapa, who bore on his body seven of the thirty two marks of a Great Being, following the Buddha. On the way, the Buddha desired to sit at the foot of a tree by the roadside, and Kassapa folded for him his outer robe (pilotikasangháti) as a seat. The Buddha sat on it and, feeling it with his hand, praised its softness. Kassapa asked him to accept it. &quot;And what would you wear?&quot; inquired the Buddha. Kassapa then begged that he might be given the rag robe worn by the Buddha. &quot;It is faded with use,&quot; said the Buddha, but Kassapa said he would prize it above the whole world and the robes were exchanged. (The robe which Kassapa exchanged with the Buddha was Punná's cloak. See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaa')"&gt;Punná 6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This incident Kassapa always recalled with pride, e.g. S.ii.221. It is said that the Buddha paid him this great honour because he knew that Kassapa would hold a recital after his death, and thus help in the perpetuation of his religion, SA.ii.130. The earth quaked again in recognition of Kassapa's virtues, for no ordinary being would have been fit to wear the Buddha's cast off robe. Kassapa, conscious of the great honour, took upon himself the thirteen austere vows (dhutaguná) and, after eight days, became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past Kassapa and Bhaddá had been husband and wife and companions in good works in many births. In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha Kassapa was a very rich householder named Vedeha and married to Bhaddá, and very </data>
<data>devoted to the Buddha. One day he heard the Buddha's third disciple in rank (Nisabha) being awarded the place of pre eminence among those who observed austere practices, and registered a wish for a similar honour for himself in the future. He learnt from the Buddha of the qualities in which Nisabha excelled the Buddha himself, and determined to obtain them. With this end in view, during birth after birth, he expended all his energies in goods deeds. Ninety one kappas ago; in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')"&gt;Vipassí&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, he was the brahmin&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekasaataka')"&gt;Ekasátaka&lt;/a&gt; and Bhaddá was his wife. In the interval between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/konaagamana')"&gt;Konágamana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddhas he was a setthiputta. He married Bhaddá, but because of an evil deed she had done in the past (see Bhaddá Kápilání), she became unattractive to him and he left her, taking her as wife again when she became attractive. Having seen from what had happened to his wife how great was the power of the Buddhas, the setthiputta wrapped Kassapa Buddha's golden cetiya with costly robes and decked it with golden lotuses, each the size of a cartwheel.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Therí Apadána (Ap.ii.582. vs. 47-51) gives an account of two more of his lives, one as Sumitta and the other as Koliyaputta, in both of which he and his wife ministered to Pacceka Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next birth he was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares, and, because he had given robes in past lives, he had thirty two kapparukkhas, which provided him and all the people of his kingdom with garments. At the suggestion of his queen, he made preparations to feed holy men, and five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumaa')"&gt;Padumá&lt;/a&gt;, came to accept his gift. In that life, too, </data>
<data>Nanda and his queen renounced the world and became ascetics, and having developed the jhánas, were reborn in the Brahma world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This account of Kassapa's last life and his previous life is compiled from AA.i.92ff.; SA.ii.135ff.; ThagA.ii.134ff.; Ap.ii.578ff. Ap.i.33ff. gives other particulars -  that he made offerings at Padumuttara's funeral pyre and that he was once a king named Ubbiddha in the city of Rammaka; see also ApA.i.209f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa was not present at the death of the Buddha; as he was journeying from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava')"&gt;Pává&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa')"&gt;Kusinára&lt;/a&gt; he met an &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aajiivakaa')"&gt;Ájívaka&lt;/a&gt; carrying in his hand a mandárava flower picked up by him from among those which had rained from heaven in honour of the Buddha, and it was he who told Kassapa the news. It was then the seventh day after the Buddha's death, and the Mallas had been trying in vain to set fire to his pyre. The arahant theras, who were present, declared that it could not be kindled until Mahá Kassapa and his five hundred companions had saluted the Buddha's feet. Mahá Kassapa then arrived and walked three times round the pyre with bared shoulder, and it is said the Buddha's feet became visible from out of the pyre in order that he might worship them. He was followed by his five hundred colleagues, and when they had all worshipped the feet disappeared and the pyre kindled of itself (D.ii.163f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mhv.xxxi.20f.; see also Vsm.430) that the relics of the Buddha which fell to Ajátasattu's share were taken to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; by Kassapa, in view of that which would happen in the future. At &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava')"&gt;Pává&lt;/a&gt; (on the announcement of the Buddha's death), Kassapa had heard the words of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhadda')"&gt;Subhadda&lt;/a&gt;, who, in his old age, had joined the </data>
<data>Order, that they were &quot;well rid of the great samana and could now do as they liked.&quot; This remark it was which had suggested to Kassapa's mind the desirability of holding a Recital of the Buddha's teachings. He announced his intention to the assembled monks, and, as the senior among them and as having been considered by the Buddha himself to be fit for such a task, he was asked to make all necessary arrangements (e.g., DA.i.3). In accordance with his wishes, all the monks, other than the arahants chosen for the Recital, left Rájagaha during the rainy season. The five hundred who were selected met in Council under the presidency of Kassapa and recited the Dhamma and the Vinaya (DA.i.3f.; 5ff.; Sp.i.4.ff.; Mhv.iii.3ff). This recital is called the Therasangití or &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/theravaada')"&gt;Theraváda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books contain numerous references to Mahá Kassapa -  he is classed with &lt;a href="maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="maha_kappina_th')"&gt;Kappina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; for his great iddhi-powers. E.g., S.i.114; but his range of knowledge was limited; there were certain things which even Kassapa did not know (DhA.i.258). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha regarded him as equal to himself in exhorting the monks to lead the active and zealous lives (S.ii.205), and constantly held him up as an example to others in his great contentment (S.ii.194f) and his ability to win over families by his preaching. The Buddha compares him to the moon (candopama), unobtrusive; his heart was free from bondage, and he always taught others out of a feeling of compassion. S.ii.197ff. Kassapa's freedom from any kind of attachment was, as the Buddha pointed out to the monks, due to the earnest wish he had made for that attainment in the past, &quot;He has no attachment </data>
<data>to requisites or households or monasteries or cells; but is like a royal swan which goes down into a lake and swims there, while the water does not adhere to his body&quot; (DhA.ii.169f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha also thought him equal to himself in his power of attaining the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/jhaana')"&gt;jhánas&lt;/a&gt; and abiding therein (S.ii.210ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa was willing to help monks along their way, and several instances are given of his exhortations to them (E.g., Thag.vss.1051-57, 1072-81, and his long sermon at A.v.161ff ); but he was evidently sensitive to criticism, and would not address them unless he felt them to be tractable and deferential to instruction. E.g., S.ii.203ff.; and at 219, when &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_nandaa')"&gt;Thullanandá&lt;/a&gt; finds fault with him for blaming &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;. See below. Kassapa had good reason for not wishing to address recalcitrant monks. The&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kutiduusaka_jat_321')"&gt;Kutidúsaka Játaka&lt;/a&gt; relates how one of his disciples,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ulunka_saddaka')"&gt;Ulunka Saddaka&lt;/a&gt;, angered by some admonition from Kassapa, burnt the latter's grass hut while he was away on his alms round (J.iii.71f.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was very reluctant to preach to the nuns, but on one occasion he allowed himself to be persuaded by Ananda, and accompanied by him he visited the nunnery and preached to the nuns. He was probably not popular among them, for, at the end of his discourse, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_tissaa')"&gt;Thullatissá&lt;/a&gt; openly reviled him for what she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ananda, &quot;as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker.&quot; (S.ii.215f) Kassapa loved Ananda dearly, and was delighted when Ananda attained arahantship </data>
<data>in time to attend the First Recital, and when Ananda appeared before the arahants, it was Kassapa who led the applause (DA.i.10f). But Kassapa was very jealous of the good name of the Order, and we find him (S.ii.218f) blaming Ananda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to the criticism of the public. &quot;A corn trampler art thou, Ananda,&quot; he says, &quot;a despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting away,&quot; and ends up with &quot;The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure.&quot; Ananda, annoyed at being called &quot;boy,&quot; protests   &quot;Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence.&quot; This incident, says the Commentary took place after the Buddha's death, when Ananda, as a new arahant and with all the honour of his intimacy with the Buddha, whose bowl and robe he now possessed, had become a notable personage. SA.ii.133; Ananda regarded Kassapa in some sort of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even his name, lest it should imply disrespect (see Vin.i.92f.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thullanandá heard Kassapa censuring Ananda and raised her voice in protest, &quot;What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can chide the learned sage Ananda?&quot; Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to Ananda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the Buddha for special honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done. S.ii.224f. At the First Council, when Ananda stated that the Buddha had given </data>
<data>leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and contempt from the laity (Vin.ii.287f.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and energetic. See also the &lt;a href="mahagosinga_s')"&gt;Mahágosinga Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.214), where Kassapa declares his belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to others is proved by the case of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somamitta_thera')"&gt;Somamitta&lt;/a&gt; who, finding his own teacher&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vimala')"&gt;Vimala&lt;/a&gt; given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came after him, that they might attain to the same end. Even when he was old and the Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near him, he begged to be excused. S.ii.202f; but See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jotidaasa')"&gt;Jotidása&lt;/a&gt;, who is said to have built a vihára for Kassapa, and entertained him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pipphaliguha')"&gt;Pipphaliguhá&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/b_f/bojjhanga')"&gt;bojjhangas&lt;/a&gt; which he had practised (S.v.78). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge that he had profited by the Master's teaching, we are told (SA.iii.128), calmed his blood and purified his system, and the sickness fell away from him &quot;like a drop of water from a lotus leaf.&quot; He </data>
<data>disdained being waited upon by anybody, even by a goddess such as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laja')"&gt;Lájá&lt;/a&gt; , lest he should set a bad example (DhA.iii.6ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owing to his great saintliness, even the gods vied with each other to give alms to Kassapa. Once when he had risen from a trance lasting seven days, five hundred nymphs, wives of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;, appeared before him; but, snapping his fingers, he asked them to depart, saying that he bestowed his favours only on the poor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Kálavilangika is an example of Kassapa's compassion for the poor. Once, after a seven days' trance, he went to the house of Kálavilanga and received alms from his wife, which he gave to the Buddha for their greater benefit. The Buddha took a portion of this and gave the rest to five hundred monks. Kálavilangika, received only a mouthful of the food left. The Buddha said that as a result he would be a setthi within seven days. Kálavilangika told this to his wife. It happened that a few days later the king saw a man impaled alive in the place of execution; the man begged him for some food, which he agreed to send. At night, when eating, the king remembered his promise, but could find no one bold enough to go to the cemetery. On the offer of one thousand pieces, Kálavilangika's wife agreed to go in the guise of a man. On the way she was stopped by the yakkha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighataphala')"&gt;Díghataphala&lt;/a&gt;, who, however, later released her and gave her treasure, as did also the yakkha's father in law, the deva &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana')"&gt;Sumana&lt;/a&gt;. The man ate the food and, when wiping his mouth, recognised her as a woman and caught hold of her hair. But she cut off her hair, and proved to the satisfaction of the king that her mission had been accomplished. She then recovered the treasure given her by the yakkha and </data>
<data>Sumana; when the king discovered her wealth, she and her husband were raised to the rank of setthi (MA.ii.812ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sakka heard of this, he disguised himself as a weaver worn with age, and accompanied by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaataa')"&gt;Sujátá&lt;/a&gt;, transformed into an old woman, appeared in a weaver's hut along the lane where Kassapa was begging. The ruse succeeded and Kassapa accepted their alms; but, later, be discovered the truth and chided Sakka. Sakka begged forgiveness, and, on being assured that in spite of his deception the almsgiving would bring him merit, he flew into the air shouting, &quot;Aho dánam, mahá danam, Kassapassa patitthitam.&quot; The Buddha heard this and sympathised with Sakka in his great joy (DhA.i.423ff.; cp. Ud.iii.7). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on one occasion so great was the importunity with which the monks of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavii')"&gt;Alavi&lt;/a&gt; had wearied the people, that even Mahá Kassapa failed to get alms from them (J.ii.282). The Visuddhi Magga (403) relates a story of how once, when Kassapa was begging for alms in Rájagaha, in the company of the Buddha, on a festival day, five hundred maidens were going to the festival carrying cakes, &quot;round like the moon.&quot; They saw the Buddha but passed him by, and gave their cakes to Kassapa. The Elder made all the cakes fill just his single bowl and offered it to the Buddha (This is probably the incident referred to at Vsm.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa_sam')"&gt;Kassapa Samyutta&lt;/a&gt; contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibbána (S.ii.195f), and the other on the existence of a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tathaagata')"&gt;Tathágata&lt;/a&gt; after death (S.ii.222f). This regard was mutual, </data>
<data>for when Kassapa saw the great honour paid to Sáriputta by the devas he rejoiced greatly and broke forth into song (Thag.vs.1082 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa lived to be very old, and, when he died, had not lain on a bed for one hundred and twenty years. DA.ii.413; AA.ii.596; he was one hundred and twenty at the time of the First Recital (SA.ii.130). According, to northern sources, Kassapa did not die; he dwells in the Kukkutagiri Mountains, wrapt in samádhi, awaiting the arrival of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metteyya')"&gt;Metteyya&lt;/a&gt; Buddha (Beal, op. cit., ii.142f.). A tooth of Mahá Kassapa was enshrined in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhimatittha_vih')"&gt;Bhímatittha vihára&lt;/a&gt; in Ceylon (Cv.lxxxv.81). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is several times referred to in the Játakas. Thus, he was  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the father in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gagga_jat_155')"&gt;Gagga Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.17),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the brahmin in the   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurudhamma_jat_276')"&gt;Kurudhamma&lt;/a&gt; (ii.381),  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;one of the devaputtas in the   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kakkaaru_jat_326')"&gt;Kakkáru&lt;/a&gt; (iii.90),  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mendissara')"&gt;Mendissara&lt;/a&gt; in the   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/indriya_jat_423')"&gt;Indriya&lt;/a&gt; (iii.469), and in the   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhanga_jat_522')"&gt;Sarabhanga&lt;/a&gt; (v.151),  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the father in the  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padakusalamanava_jat_432')"&gt;Padakusalamánava&lt;/a&gt; (iii.514),    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the teacher in the  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tittira_j_37_117_319_438')"&gt;Tittira&lt;/a&gt; (iii.545),    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maatali')"&gt;Mátali&lt;/a&gt; in the   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bilarikosiya_jat_450')"&gt;Bílárakosiya&lt;/a&gt; (iv.69),  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;one of the seven brothers in the</data>

Hearing this several monks protested, but failed to convince him of his error. Sáti was therefore brought before the Buddha and acknowledged that he had spread such a view. The Buddha explains that he had always taught that consciousness arises only by causation and that, without assignable condition, consciousness does not come about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four substances (áhárá), which either maintain existing organisms or help those yet to be: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;material substance, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;contact, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;cogitation, and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;perception. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The derivation and birth of all four substances is craving-  craving arises from feeling and so on. Three things must combine for a conception to take place: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the coitus of the parents, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the menstruation, at the time, of the mother,   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;and the presence of a being awaiting rebirth (gandhabba).

He courted a female hawk on the western shore, and, at her suggestion, made friends with an osprey on the west side, a lion on the north and a tortoise on an island in the lake. Later, the hawks had two sons, who lived on the island. One day, some men, wandering about in search of food, lay down under the tree where the hawks lived and kindled a fire to keep away the insects. The smoke disturbed the young ones and they set up a cry. The men, hearing this, wished to get the birds for their food. But the she hawk, perceiving the danger, sent her husband to summon their friends. First came the osprey who brought water in his wings and quenched the fire every time it was lighted; when he was tired, the tortoise sent his son with mud from the lake, which he put on the fire. The men caught the tortoise and tied it with creepers, but he plunged into the water, dragging the men with him. Then the lion appeared, and at his first roar the men fled, and the friends rejoiced over the firmness of their friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Mittagandhaka (q.v.) and his wife. They were the hawks of the story. Ráhula was the young tortoise and Moggallána the father tortoise. Sáriputta was the osprey and the Bodhisatta the lion.

The citizens of Benares once invited the Buddha and his monks and went about asking people to help in their entertainment. In spite of their extreme poverty, Maháduggata and his wife undertook to look after one monk; they both worked hard to earn the necessary money and then prepared a simple meal. Sakka, knowing what was to come, came in the guise of a labourer to help them. When the time came for the meal it was found that in allotting the monks to their several hosts, Maháduggata's house had been overlooked. Maháduggata wrung his hands and burst into tears, but somebody pointed out to him that nobody was yet entertaining the Buddha. He, therefore, went to the vihára and invited the Buddha, who accepted the invitation, while princes and nobles waited outside wishing to conduct him to their own palaces. The Buddha ate the food prepared by Maháduggata and Sakka and returned thanks. That same day, by the power of Sakka, the seven kinds of jewels fell from the sky and filled Maháduggata's house, and when it was reported to the king that he was the wealthiest man in the city, he was appointed Treasurer. Maháduggata built a new house and discovered many hidden treasures while digging the foundations. With the money from these he entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days, and, after death, was reborn in heaven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pandita')"&gt;Panditasámanera&lt;/a&gt;.

At sight of him all the people disappeared except one man, who made enquiries, and, on finding that he was no rebel, took him home and entertained him with great honour, looking well after his horse. When the king left, he told the man that his name was Mahá Assároha, and asked him to visit his home if ever he should be in the city. On reaching the city himself, he gave orders to the gate keepers that if anyone should come enquiring for Mahá Assároha, he should be brought at once to the palace. Time passed and the man failed to appear. The king, therefore, constantly increased the taxes of the village, until the villagers asked their neighbour to visit his friend Mahá Assároha and try to obtain some relief. So he prepared presents for Mahá Assároha and his wife, and taking a cake baked in his own house he set forth. Arrived at the city gates, he was conducted by the gate keeper to the palace. There the king accepted his presents, showed him all the honours due to a king, and, in the end, gave him half of his kingdom. When the ministers complained, through the medium of the king's son, that a mere villager had been exalted to the rank of king, the Bodhisatta explained that real friends who help one in time of adversity should be paid every honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the good offices of Ananda, who is identified with the villager.

<data>&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;1. Mahákapi Játaka (No. 407)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a monkey, leader of eighty thousand. In the grove where they lived was a mango tree (some say a banyan) growing on a river bank bearing fruit of divine flavour, and the monkeys were always careful to let no fruit drop into the river. But one day a fruit, which bad been hidden by an ants' nest, fell into the water, and was picked up at Benares, where the king was bathing. The king tasted it, and being seized with a desire to eat more, had many rafts made, and ascended the river with a company of foresters. They found the tree, and the king, having eaten his fill, lay down at the foot. At midnight the Bodhisatta came with his retinue and started eating the mangoes. The king was disturbed, and gave orders to his archers that the wood should be surrounded and all the monkeys shot at daybreak. But the Bodhisatta was a real leader; he ascended a straight-growing branch and, with one leap, reached the river bank. He then marked the distance, and having cut off a bamboo shoot of the required length, fastened one end to a tree on the bank and the other end round his waist. On leaping back, he found he had not allowed for the length which went round his waist, but grasping a branch firmly with both hands, he signalled to his followers to cross the bridge so formed. The eighty thousand monkeys thus escaped; but the monkey who was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;, coming last, saw a chance of injuring the Bodhisatta, and taking a spring into the air, fell on the Bodhisatta's back, breaking it, There the Bodhisatta hung in agony, and the king who had seen all this caused him to be brought down and covered with a yellow robe and ministered to. But nothing could be done, and the Bodhisatta died after having admonished the king. A funeral pyre was made with </data>
<data>one hundred wagon loads of timber, and the dead monkey was paid all the honours due to a king. A shrine was built on the spot where the cremation took place, while the skull was inlaid with gold and taken to Benares, where a great feast was held in its honour for seven days. Afterwards it was enshrined and offerings were made to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told concerning good works towards one's relations, as narrated in the introduction to the Bhaddasála Játaka. Ananda is identified with the king. J.iii.369-75; cf. Játakamálá, No. 27; the story is sculptured in the stúpa of Bharhut, Cunningham, pl.xxxiii.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka is also called the Rájováda Játaka. It is probably this story which is said to have greatly impressed Ilanága when he heard it from the Thera Mahápaduma, who lived in Tuládhára. Mhv.xxxv.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;2. Mahákapi Játaka (No. 516)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a monkey, and one day, in the forest, he came across a man who had fallen into a pit while looking for his oxen and had lain there starving for ten days. The Bodhisatta pulled him out and then lay down to sleep. But the man, very hungry, and wishing to eat him, struck his head with a stone, grievously wounding him. The monkey at once climbed a tree in order to escape, but realizing that the man would be unable to find his way out of the forest, he jumped from tree to tree (in spite of his intense pain) and showed him the way out. The man became a leper, and wandered about for seven years till he came to the Migácira Park in Benares and told his story to the king. At the end of his recital the earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avíci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta's&lt;/a&gt; attempt to kill the Buddha by hurling a stone upon him. The leper was Devadatta. J.v.67 </data>

At the request of Sakka and of members of the Order, led by Assagutta, he was born in the world of men as Nágasena. Mil. 6f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahásena.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin, friend of Vanganta, father of Sáriputta. He was poor, and, out of compassion for him, Sáriputta came to his house for alms. Twice Mahásena hid himself, having nothing to give, but, one day, receiving a bowl of rice porridge and a small piece of cloth, he thought of Sáriputta. The Elder had just risen from a trance, and, becoming aware of Mahásena's desire, he visited him, and was given the porridge and the piece of cloth with a prayer from Mahásena, &quot;May I realize the Truth you have seen.&quot; After death, Mahásena was born as the novice and was called Vanavásí Tissa. DhA.ii.84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahásena.&lt;/b&gt; Younger son of King Gothábhaya. He became king of Ceylon (334&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-361 A.C.), and under the advice of his teacher Sanghamitta and his minister Sona, he despoiled Mahávihára and enriched Abhayagiri. He issued a decree that no one should give alms to the monks of Mahávihára. But, later, his friend and minister, Meghavannábhaya, convinced him of his error, and he became a supporter of Mahávihára. Soon after, however, he fell under the influence of a monk, named Tissa, and built Jetavanavihará in the precincts of Mahávihára, despite the protests of the monks. Tissa was later expelled from the Order. The king built the Manihíra, Gokanna, Erakávilla, Kalandagáma, Migagáma, Gangásenakapabbata, Dhátusenapabbata, Kokaváta, Rúpáráma, and Hulapitthi viháras and two nunneries   Uttara and Abhaya.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásupina Játaka (No. 77)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi, king of Kosala, had, one night, sixteen bad dreams, and his brahmins, on being consulted, said that they presaged harm either to his kingdom, his life, or his wealth, and prescribed all manner of sacrifices in order to avert the danger (It is perhaps this sacrifice which is referred to at S.i.75). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malliká, the king's wife, heard of this and suggested that the Buddha should be consulted. The king followed her advice, and the Buddha explained the dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The first dream was of wild bulls entering the royal   courtyard to fight but retiring after roaring and bellowing. This, said the   Buddha, meant that, in future, when wicked kings rule, rain clouds will   gather, but there will be no rain. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The second dream was of trees and shrubs sprouting from   the earth which flowered and bore fruit when only about one span high. This   foretold a time when men would be short lived owing to their lusts.   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the third dream cows sucked calves which were hardly   a day old. This showed that, in the future, the young would refuse respect to   the old. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The fourth dream was of sturdy draught oxen standing   by, while young steers tried to draw loads. This signified a time when the   administration of affairs will be entrusted to the young and inexperienced,   while the wise and old stand by. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The fifth dream was of a horse which ate from two   mouths, one on either side of its body, which foretold a time when the king's   justices will take bribes from contending parties and give themselves to   corruption. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The sixth dream was of people holding a very valuable   golden bowl and asking a jackal to stale therein. This shows that, in the </data>
<data>  future, kings will exalt the low born and noble maidens will be mated with   upstarts. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The seventh dream was of a man holding a rope which he   trailed at his feet, while a she jackal kept on eating it. This foretold a   time when women will lose their sense of modesty and behave badly.   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the eighth dream was a big pitcher at the palace   gates filled with water and surrounded by empty ones. This foretold a time   when kings will be poor and set the whole country working for them, the people   being left in extreme poverty. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The ninth dream was of a deep pool with sloping banks   overgrown with lotus. Men and beasts entered the pond; the middle was muddy,   but at the edges was crystal water. This meant that in the future there would   be unrighteous kings oppressing the people, who would leave the capital and   take refuge in the frontier districts. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The tenth dream was of rice cooking in a pot, which   rice, instead of cooking evenly, remained in three parts: some sodden, some   raw, some well cooked; this showed that in the future men of all classes, even   brahmins and sages, will be wicked, the very forces of nature will be against   them, and their harvest will be spoiled. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The eleventh dream was of men bartering butter milk for   precious sandal wood, and presaged a time when the Dhamma would decay and its   votaries clamour for money and gifts. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The twelfth dream was of empty pumpkins sinking in the   water; the world will be reversed: the low born will become great lords and   the noble sink into poverty. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the thirteenth dream solid blocks of rock floated in   the water; nobles and wise men will be scorned while upstarts shall have their   own way. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the fourteenth dream tiny frogs chewed huge snakes </data>
<data>  and ate them; a time will come when men, because of their lusts, will become   the slaves of their wives and be ruled by them. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The fifteenth dream was of a wicked village crow   attended by mallards; kings will arise, ignorant and cowardly, who will rise   to power, not their peers, but their footmen, barbers, and the like; nobles   will be reduced to waiting on these upstarts. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the sixteenth dream goats chased panthers, devouring   them; the lowborn will be raised to lordship and nobles will sink into   obscurity and distress; when the latter plead for their rights, the king's   minions will have them cudgelled and bastinadoed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having thus explained the dreams, the Buddha told Pasenadi a story of the past. A king of Benares, named Brahmadatta, had dreams similar to those of Pasenadi. When he consulted the brahmins, they began to prepare sacrifices. A young brahmin protested, saying that animal sacrifice was against the teaching of the Vedas, but they would not listen. The Bodhisatta, who was a hermit in the Himálaya, possessed of insight, became aware of what was happening, travelled through the air and took his seat in the park. There he was seen by a young brahmin, who brought the king to the park. The Bodhisatta heard the king's dreams and explained them to his satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the king and Sáriputta the young brahmin.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá Kappina Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha, considered foremost among those who taught the monks (bhikkuovádakánam) (A.i.25). He was older than the Buddha, and was born in a frontier kingdom three hundred yojanas in extent, in the city of Kukkutavatí. On the death of his father he became rájá under the name of Mahá Kappina. His chief wife was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anojaa')"&gt;Anojá&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sagala')"&gt;Ságala&lt;/a&gt; in the Madda kingdom. She had been his companion in good works in past births. Every morning Mahá Kappina would send men out of the four gates of the city to stop any scholarly or learned men who might happen to pass along the road, and then to return and tell him of them. He owned five horses: Vála, Puppha, Válaváhana, Pupphaváhana and Supatta. Supatta he alone rode, the others were used by his messengers. One day, after the Buddha's appearance in the world, traders came from Sávatthi to Kukkutavatí and, after disposing of their goods, went to see Mahá Kappina. He received them and asked them about their country and the teaching (sásana) which they followed. &quot;Sire,&quot; they replied, “we cannot tell you with unwashed mouths.&quot; A golden jug of water was brought, and with cleansed mouths and clasped hands they told the king of the appearance of the Buddha. At the word &quot;Buddha&quot; Kappina's body was suffused with rapture. He made them utter the word three times, giving them one hundred thousand pieces. The men told him also of the Dhamma and the Sangha, and he trebled his gifts and forthwith renounced the world, followed by his ministers. They set forth to find the Buddha, and reached the bank of a river which they crossed by an &quot;Act of Truth,&quot; saying, &quot;If this teacher be a Sammásambuddha, let </data>
<data>not even a hoof of these horses be wetted.&quot; In this manner they crossed three rivers: the Aravacchá, the Nílaváhana (q.v.), and the Candabhágá. The Buddha perceived them with his divine eye, and after he had eaten at Sávatthi, went through the air to the banks of the Candabhágá (one hundred and twenty yojanas, says J.iv.180; see also SNA.ii.440)  and sat down under the great banyan tree facing the landing stage of the river, sending forth Buddha rays. Kappina and his men saw him and prostrated themselves. The Buddha taught them the Doctrine, and they became arahants and joined the Order, the formula &quot;Ehi bhikkhu&quot; being their sanction and their ordination. But see Vsm.393, where it says that at the end of the sermon Kappina became only an anágámin and his followers sotápannas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anojá and the wives of Kappina's ministers hearing that their husbands had renounced the world and gone to see the Buddha, determined to do likewise. They crossed the river in the same way as Kappina and his retinue, and approached the Buddha as he sat under the banyan tree on the banks of the Candabhágá. The Buddha made the husbands and wives invisible to each other and preached to the latter. They became sotápannas and were ordained by Uppalavanná, the Buddha taking the monks to Jetavana. Mahá Kappina spent his days in the ecstasy of jhána, and so full of happiness was he that he constantly repeated &quot;aho sukham, aho sukham,&quot; which made the monks suspect that he was longing for the pleasures of kingship which he had left behind, until the Buddha dispelled their doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day the Buddha discovered that Kappina lived inactively, enjoying his happiness, and that he never taught anybody. (Vin.i.105 records that when Kappina was in the Deer Park at Maddakucchi he wondered whether he need attend the uposatha ceremonies, since he himself was pure). The </data>
<data>Buddha appeared before him, telling him to go. He sent for him and asked him to teach the Doctrine to his associates. This Kappina did, and at the end of a single sermon one thousand listening recluses became arahants, hence the title conferred on him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Kappina had registered a vow to become chief among admonishers of monks, having seen a similar honour conferred on a disciple of the Buddha. He was at that time an assessor (akkhadassa) of Hamsavatí, and having invited the Buddha and his monks entertained them with great honour. In another birth he was a Koliyan, and waited upon five hundred Pacceka Buddhas and gave them robes. The story of the entertainment of the Pacceka Buddhas is given at length in DhA.ii.112ff., and the number given there is one thousand. They came to Benares, but the king, occupied with the ploughing festival, asked them to return on the third day. The wife of the senior weaver of a village near by heard this and invited the Pacceka Buddhas to her village, where there were one thousand artisans. On the invitation being accepted, she returned quickly to the village, told the people of what she had done, and they all made the necessary preparations, each family looking after one Pacceka Buddha. The Pacceka Buddhas, by their own wish, stayed on for three months, the same woman seeing to all their comforts. At the end of their visit, she persuaded each family to give a set of robes to its own Pacceka Buddha. The senior weaver was Kappina and his wife Anojá. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, he was the leader of a guild of one thousand men and built a great parivena containing one thousand rooms. AA.i.175ff.; ThagA.i.507ff.; SA.ii.172ff.; DhA.ii.117ff. gives a more detailed and slightly different version; ep. Avadánas.ii.102f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DhA.ii.115f) that once Kassapa Buddha was </data>
<data>preaching and that all the householders of Benares, with their families, went to hear him. Scarcely had they entered the monastery when there was a heavy downpour of rain. Those who had friends among the novices and monks found shelter in their cells, the others were unprotected. The senior householder then suggested that they should build a great monastery so that all might be sheltered in future; the others agreeing, he himself gave one thousand, each of the other men five hundred, and each woman two hundred and fifty. The monastery had one thousand pinnacles, and when money ran short, each gave half as much again. At the dedication ceremony the festival lasted for seven days. The senior householder's wife, Anojá, offered the Buddha a casket of anoja flowers and placed at his feet a garment of the colour of the flowers worth one thousand, and made a wish that in future births her body should be of the colour of the anoja flower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Kappina was famed as a teacher of monks, the Theragáthá, curiously enough, contains verses in which he admonishes the nuns (bhikkhuniyo) (Thag.vss. 547 556; ThagA.i.511).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappina is described by the Buddha as pale (? odáta), thin, and having a prominent nose (tanukam tunganásikam). He possessed great iddhi-powers and had attained every samápatti, which could be attained (J.ii.284). (It was owing to his iddhi powers that he was able to follow the Buddha to the Brahma world, S.i.145; see also S.v.315, where he is described as samádhibhávaníya). It has been remarked (Brethren, p.257 n.2) that the verses attributed to him are, for the most part, more gnomic sayings of popular philosophy than genuine Dhamma, and that they would have befitted an early Greek Pagan. Mrs. Rhys Davids (J.R.A.S. 1927, ii.p.206f; also Sákya, p.140) has an interesting theory that Kappina was Assaji’s teacher.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Mahá Kappina was quite often in the company of Sáriputta, and it is said (Thag.vs.1086) that once, seeing the profound homage the gods payed to his colleague, he smiled by way of congratulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Kappina Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

ThagA.ii.141; AA.i.99; SA.ii.143.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahátittha.&lt;/b&gt; The name of Mahámeghavana in the time of Kakusandha Buddha. It was presented to the Buddha by king Abhaya, who planted in it a branch of the Bodhi tree brought by Rucánandá. Mhv.xv. 58, 73f., 83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Mahátittha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landing place on the west coast of Ceylon. The wives brought from Madhurá for Vijaya and his companions landed there, hence the name (Mhv.vii.58; see Mhv.Trs.60, n.1). There landed also in later times Bhalluka, from South India (Mhv.xxv.79), the Damilas and others who invaded Ceylon (Mhv.xxxiii.39; Cv.lviii.14; Cv.xi.37; Cv.lxxxviii.63). It was probably the chief port f or vessels plying between South India and Ceylon. Thus, it was from there that Sakkasenápati embarked for the Pandu country (Cv.lii.73), and there that the Pandu king landed from Cola (Cv.liii.5). The expeditionary force of Vijayabáhu I. embarked there for Cola (Cv.lx.34), as did the forces of Parakkamabáhu I. under Lankápura (Cv.lxxvi.83). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a convenient place for preparations to be made before advancing on the capital, or merely journeying thither (thus Cv.lxviii.81; Cv.li.28). It was a place of strategic importance, and when Mágha and Jayabáhu invaded Ceylon, they set up fortifications there. Cv.lxxxiii.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahásíhanáda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at the Mahávana in Vesáli. Sáriputta tells the Buddha that Sunakkhatta, who had recently left the Order, went about saying that there was nothing marvellous about the Buddha's knowledge and insight and that his teachings did not lead to the end of Ill. The Buddha says that Sunakkhatta is a man of wrath and folly and incapable of appreciating the good either of the Tathágata or of his teachings. He then issues his challenge to the effect that no one can deny to the Tathágata the possession of ten powers, (balá) -  which are enumerated -  and the four confidences (vesárajjá). The Tathágata can attend any of the eight assemblies without fear; he knows the various classifications of beings, the birth of beings, the way to Nibbána; he can read the minds of men and the five destinies which await different beings. He has lived the fourfold higher life being foremost in his practice of asceticism, in loathliness, in scrupulosity, in solitude. No one has surpassed him in the practice of these things. He has discovered, by experimentation, the futility of the claims of those who maintain that purity comes by way of food, or offering, or ritual. Though eighty years old and his body broken down, yet his powers of mind are at their prime; even if he must be carried on a litter, yet will his mind retain its powers (M.i.68 83).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nágasamála, who is by, asks the Buddha for a title for the discourse, and the Buddha gives it the name of Lomahamsapariyáya. cp. Lomahamsa Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Maháválukagangá, Mahágangá, Maháválukanadí&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief river of Ceylon, the modern Maháveliganga. Viewed from the city of Anurádhapura, the right bank was called páragangá and the left oragangá. The river was of great strategic importance, and is mentioned in various accounts of campaigns between opposing armies. It was always regarded as the boundary between North Ceylon, with Anurádhapura (and later, Pulatthipura) as the centre, and the South east province of Rohana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various fords on this river are mentioned in the books, the chief among these being Kacchakatittha, Ganthambatittha, Mahárukkhatittha, Málágámatittha, Yakkhasúkaratittha, Sarogámatittha, Sahassatittha and Suvannatthambhatittha. There were evidently other fords at the bends of the river with no particular names (e.g., Cv.lxxii.285). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kings of Ceylon constructed various canals branching off from the river to help in their irrigation schemes. One such was the Pabbatanta Canal, built by Mahásena (Mhv.xxxvii.50); while the Aciravatí, the Gomatí, and the Malápaharani were constructed by Parakkamabáhu I. (Cv.lxxix.51f). Dhátusena irrigated the surrounding fields by means of damming up the river (Cv.xxxviii.12), as did Sena II. by the construction of the Manimekhala dam (Cv.li.72). In the time of Parakkamabáhu II. and, later, of Vijayabáhu IV., great ordination ceremonies were held on the river at Sahassatittha (Cv.lxxxvii.72; lxxxix.70f), and again at Ganthambatittha in the time of Vimaladhammasúriya I. Cv.xciv.17; also Vimaladhammasúriya II. (Cv.xcvii.12). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river rises in Samantakúta (Cv.c.82). The Mahánágavana of the Yakkhas, where, later, was erected the Mahiyangathúpa, was on the right bank of the river. Cv.lxxxix.70; Mhv.Trs., p.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Bodhisatta was his son, and was called Dhammapala-kumára. He went to study at Takkasilá. There the teacher's eldest son died, but among all the lamentations it was noticed that Dhammapála did not weep. When questioned by his fellows as to how he could refrain, he answered that as it was impossible for anybody young to die, he did not believe his friend was dead. The teacher asked him about this, and found that in Dhammapála's family no one died young. Wishing to know if this were true, he left Takkasilá and went to the home of Dhammapála, carrying with him the bones of a goat. After his welcome had subsided, he announced to Dhammapála that his son was dead, and begged him not to grieve. But Dhammapála clapped his hands and laughed, saying that such a thing could never be as no member of their family ever died young. He then told the brahmin, in answer to his query, that they owed their longevity to the fact that they lived good lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Suddhodana, who told the Buddha how, when the Buddha was practising severe penances, some gods came to him (Suddhodana) and said that he was dead. But he refused to believe them. Suddhodana was Mahádhammapála and the teacher Sáriputta (J.iv.50 55). At the conclusion of the Játaka Suddhodana became an anágámí and Mahá-Pajápatí Gotamí a sotápanna. DhA.i.99; J.i.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She was born at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadaha')"&gt;Devadaha&lt;/a&gt; in the family of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; as the younger sister of &lt;a href="mahamaayaa')"&gt;Mahámáyá&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ap.ii.538 says her father was Añjana Sakka and her mother Sulakkhaná. Mhv.ii.18 says her father was Añjana and her mother &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasodharaa')"&gt;Yasodhará&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandapaanii')"&gt;Dandapáni&lt;/a&gt; and Suppabuddha were her brothers; cp. Dpv.xviii.7f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the birth of each sister, interpreters of bodily marks prophesied that their children would be cakkavattins. King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt; married both the sisters, and when Mahámáyá died, seven days after the birth of the Buddha, Pajápati looked after the Buddha and nursed him. She was the mother of Nanda, but it is said that she gave her own son to nurses and herself nursed the Buddha. The Buddha was at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt; when Suddhodana died, and Pajápatí decided to renounce the world, and waited for an opportunity to ask the permission of the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pajápatí was already a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. She attained this eminence when the Buddha first visited his father's palace and preached the &lt;a href="mahadhammapala_jat_447')"&gt;Mahádhammapála Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.97).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her opportunity came when the Buddha visited &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt; to settle the dispute between the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya')"&gt;Sákiyans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/koliyaa')"&gt;Koliyans&lt;/a&gt; as to the right to take water from the river &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rohini')"&gt;Rohiní&lt;/a&gt;. When the dispute had been settled, the Buddha </data>
<data>preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kalahavivaada_s')"&gt;Kalahaviváda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, and five hundred young Sákiyan men joined the Order. Their wives, led by Pajápatí, went to the Buddha and asked leave to be ordained as nuns. This leave the Buddha refused, and he went on to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt;. But Pajápatí and her companions, nothing daunted, had barbers to cut off their hair, and donning yellow robes, followed the Buddha to Vesáli on foot. They arrived with wounded feet at the Buddha's monastery and repeated their request. The Buddha again refused, but Ananda interceded on their behalf and their request was granted, subject to eight strict conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For details see Vin.ii.253ff.; also A.iv.274ff. There was some question, which arose later as to the procedure of Pajápatí's ordination, which was not formal. When the nuns discovered this some of them refused to hold the uposatha with her. But the Buddha declared that he himself had ordained her and that all was in order (DhA.iv.149). Her upasampadá consisted in acquiescing in the eight conditions laid down for nuns (Sp.i.242).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her ordination, Pajápatí came to the Buddha and worshipped him. The Buddha preached to her and gave her a subject for meditation. With this topic she developed insight and soon after won arahantship, while her five hundred companions attained to the same after listening to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandakovada_s')"&gt;Nandakováda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. Later, at an assembly of monks and nuns in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha declared Pajápatí chief of those who had experience (rattaññúnam) (A.i.25). Not long after, while at Vesáli, she realized that her life had come to an end. She was one hundred and twenty years old; she took leave of the Buddha, performed various miracles, and then died, her five hundred companions </data>
<data>dying with her. It is said that the marvels which attended her cremation rites were second only to those of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha that Pajápatí made her resolve to gain eminence. She then belonged to a clansman's family in Hamsavatí, and, hearing the Buddha assign the foremost place in experience to a certain nun, wished for similar recognition herself, doing many good deeds to that end. After many births she was born once more at Benares, forewoman among five hundred slave girls. When the rains drew near, five Pacceka Buddhas came from Nandamúlaka to Isipatana seeking lodgings. Pajápatí saw them after the Treasurer had refused them any assistance, and, after consultation with her fellow slaves, they persuaded their several husbands to erect five huts for the Pacceka Buddhas during the rainy season and they provided them with all requisites. At the end of the rains they gave three robes to each Pacceka Buddha. After that she was born in a weaver's village near Benares, and again ministered, this time to five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumavati')"&gt;Padumavatí&lt;/a&gt; (ThigA.140ff.; AA.i.185f.; Ap.ii.529 43).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that once Pajápatí made a robe for the Buddha of wonderful material and marvellously elaborate. But when it came to be offered to the Buddha he refused it, and suggested it should be given to the Order as a whole. Pajápatí was greatly disappointed, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; intervened. But the Buddha explained that his suggestion was for the greater good of Pajápatí, and also as an example to those who might wish to make similar gifts in the future. This was the occasion for the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dakkhinaavibhanga_s')"&gt;Dakkhinávibhanga Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.253ff.; </data>
<data>MA.ii.1001ff.; this incident is referred to in the Milinda p.240). The Buddha had a great love for Pajápatí, and when she lay ill, as there were no monks to visit her and preach to her -  that being against the rule -  the Buddha amended the rule and went himself to preach to her (Vin.iv.56).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pajápatí's name appears several times in the Játakas. She was the mother monkey in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_nandiya_jat_222')"&gt;Cúla Nandiya Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.202), Candá in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_dhammapaala_jat_358')"&gt;Culla Dhammapála&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.182), and Bhikkhudáyiká (or Bhikkhudásiká) daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kikii')"&gt;Kiki&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares (J.vi.481).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahápajápatí was so called because, at her birth, augerers prophesied that she would have a large following; Gotamí was her gotta name (MA.i.1001; cp. AA.ii.774).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a story related of a nurse employed by Pajápatí and born in Devadaha. She renounced the world with Pajápatí, but for twenty five years was harassed by thoughts of lust till, at last, she heard &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammadinnaa')"&gt;Dhammadinná&lt;/a&gt; preach.&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt; She then practiced meditation and became an arahant.

His name was Bodhi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, during the rains, he came to Benares, and, at the invitation of the king, stayed in the royal park. The king had five councillors, unjust men, who sat in the judgment hall giving unjust judgments. One day a man, who had been very badly treated by them, asked Bodhi to intervene. Bodhi reheard the case and decided in his favour. The people applauded, and the king begged Bodhi to dispense justice in his court. Bodhi reluctantly agreed and twelve years passed. The former councillors, deprived of their gains, plotted against Bodhi and constantly poisoned the king's mind against him; they first decreased all the honours paid to Bodhi, and when this failed to drive him away, obtained the king's permission to kill him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tawny dog, to whom Bodhi used to give food from his bowl, overheard the plot, and, when Bodhi approached the palace the next day, bared his teeth and barked as a warning of the conspiracy. Bodhi understood, returned to his hut, and, in spite of the king's expression of remorse, left the city, promising to return later, and dwelt in a frontier village. The councillors, nervous lest Bodhi should return, informed the king that Bodhi and the queen were conspiring to slay him. Believing their words, he had the queen put to death. The queen's four sons thereupon rose in revolt, and the king was in great danger and fear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bodhi heard of this, he took a dried monkey skin, went to Benares, and stayed again in the royal park. The king came to do him honour, but Bodhi sat silent, stroking the monkey skin. The king asked him why he did so. He answered, &quot;This monkey was of the greatest service to me; I </data>
<data>travelled about on its back, it carried my water pot, swept out my dwelling, and performed various other duties for me; in the end, through its simplicity, I ate its flesh and now I sit and lie on its skin.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(He had used the skin for his garment, hence &quot;I sat on the monkey's back&quot;; he had the skin on his shoulder, whence his water pot was suspended, hence &quot;it carried the water pot&quot;; he had swept the cell with the skin, hence &quot;swept my dwelling place&quot;; he had eaten the flesh of the monkey, hence &quot;I ate its flesh&quot;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The councillors who were present made great uproar, calling him a murderer and a traitor. But Bodhi knew that of these councillors, one denied the effect of all kamma, one attributed everything to a Supreme Being, one believed that everything was a result of past actions, one believed in annihilation, and one held the khattiya doctrine that one should secure one's interests, even to the extent of killing one's parents. He, therefore, argued with one after another, and proved that in accordance with their doctrines no blame whatever attached to him for having killed the monkey. Having thus completed their discomfiture, he exhorted the king not to trust in slanderers, and asked the king's sons to obtain their father's pardon. The king wished the councillors to be killed, but Bodhi intervened, and they were disgraced and exiled from the kingdom, their hair fastened in five locks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in the same circumstances as the &lt;a href="mahaummagga_jat_546')"&gt;Maháummagga Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.

His parents possessed eighty crores, and, for all education, he learnt music and singing. He married the daughter of an equally rich family and of similar education. After the death of their parents, they were very rich. One night, as the husband was on his way from the palace, some knaves tempted him to drink. He soon fell a victim to the habit and all his wealth was squandered. Then he spent his wife's money, and finally sold all his belongings, and used to go about begging, a potsherd in his hand. One day the Buddha, seeing him waiting outside the refectory for leavings of food, smiled. In answer to Ananda, who asked him the reason for his smile, the Buddha said that there was a man who had had the power of becoming chief Treasurer or attaining arahantship, if he did but use his opportunities, but he was now reduced to beggary, like a heron in a dried up pond. DhA.iii.129ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahádhana.  &lt;/b&gt;A merchant of Sávatthi. Five hundred thieves once attempted unsuccessfully to enter his house, but hearing that he was about to travel through a forest with five hundred carts laden with goods, they lay in wait for him. The merchant took with him five hundred monks and entertained them in a village at the entrance to the forest. As he tarried there several days, the thieves sent a man to find out when he might be setting out, which he learnt would be soon. The villagers warned the merchant of the thieves' intention, and he gave up the idea of the journey and decided to return home. But on hearing that the thieves were lying in ambush on tile homeward road, he stayed in the village. The monks returned to Jetavana and told the Buddha, who taught them </data>
<data>that men should avoid evil even as Mahádhana avoided thieves. DhA.iii.21f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahádhana.&lt;/b&gt; A merchant of Benares. On his way to Sávatthi with five hundred carts filled with cloth of the colour of safflower, he came to the river and unyoked his oxen, thinking to cross on the morrow. In the night it rained and there was a flood. For seven days the rain continued, and Mahádhana decided to stay until his wares were sold and then return home. The Buddha, on his begging rounds, saw him and smiled. When asked the reason by Ananda, he said that the man, in spite of all his plans, had only seven days to live. With the Buddha's permission, Ananda warned Mahádhana, who thereupon invited the Buddha and his monks and entertained them. At the end of the meal the Buddha preached to him and he became a Sotápanna. Shortly after he was seized with pain in the head and died immediately, to be re born in Tusita. DhA.iii.429f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahádhana&lt;/b&gt;. A very rich man of Rájagaha. He had only one son, to whom he taught nothing, in case he should weary of learning. The boy, when grown up, married a woman likewise of no education. After the death of his father, he squandered all his wealth and sought refuge in a destitute's home (anáthasálá). Thieves saw him there, and as he was young and strong enlisted his services. One night the thieves broke into a house, but the owner awoke and pursued them, catching Mahádhana's son, who was brought before the king. The king ordered him to be beheaded. The courtesan of the city, Sulasá, saw him being led to execution, and remembering their past friendship, gave him sweetmeats and drink, bribing the guard to let him have them.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahápadána Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourteenth sutta of the Dígha Nikáya. It gives an account of the general events attendant on the advent of a Buddha, and gives various facts connected with the Buddhas, with details of seven Buddhas by way of illustration. But it is only the life of Vipassí, the first of the seven Buddhas preceding Gotama, which is at all elaborately treated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was preached at the Karerimandapa in Jetavana, and was the result of a conversation among the monks, in which they expressed the desire to know something of the births of previous Buddhas (D.ii.6 54). It is noteworthy that the Cullaniddesa (p. 80) cites the sutta as a typical example of the earlier Játakas. Some regard it as the basis of the Mahávastu.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is held in great esteem and is called in the Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.480) the &quot;King of Suttas&quot; (Suttantarájá), because no other sutta contains so many bhánváras (one hundred and twenty six).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Maháariyavamsa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the four Ariyan lineages, reckoned as ancient and pure, and held in esteem by discerning recluses and brahmins of all times. A monk is content with any kind of robe; he does not, for the sake of robes, resort to unseemly conduct; he is free from either selfishness or greed with regard to robes; neither does he exalt himself because of his contentment. So it is with other requisites. He also delights in abandoning and in bhávaná. A monk possessed of these four Ariyavamsá verily becomes a sage, praised by Brahmá himself (A.ii.27ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta was evidently a favourite topic for a sermon (AA.i.385, 386). The Commentary explains (AA.ii.494) how, for instance, anyone who preaches on the first three Ariyavamsá (catupaccayasantosa) could bring the whole Vinaya Pitaka to bear on the discussion, while a discussion on the bhávanáráma-ariyavamsa could include the two other Pitakas, chiefly the nekkhammapáli of the Patisambhidámagga, the Dasuttara Sutta of the Dígha Nikáya, the Satipatthána Sutta of the Majjhima Nikáya, and the Niddesapariyáya of the Abhidhamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full name of the sutta seems to have been Catupaccayasantosabhávanáráma Maháariyavamsa Sutta (AA.i.385). It was also probably called Vamsa Sutta for short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is probably this Maháariyavamsa Sutta which was held in such high esteem by Voháraka Tissa, that he ordered almsgiving throughout Ceylon whenever the &quot;Ariyavamsa&quot; was read (Mhv.xxxvi.38; but see Mhv.Trs.258, n. 6). It is said that people would journey five yojanas to hear a monk preach the Ariyavamsa (E.g., AA.i.386), and mention is made of Maháariyavamsabhánaká, who, judging from the stories of them (E.g., SA.iii.151), were extremely able and eloquent preachers.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásamaya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahásamaya Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Preached at &lt;a href="mahavana')"&gt;Mahávana&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was staying with five hundred arahants. The gods of the ten thousand world systems had come to visit the Buddha and the monks, and were joined by four gods from the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhavaasa')"&gt;Suddhávásá&lt;/a&gt;, who saluted the Buddha in verse. The Buddha then addressed the monks and recited this sutta (D.ii.253-62). It is possible to divide the discourse into three parts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first contains a list of the devas and other beings present to worship the Buddha. It is a long list of strange names given in verses, mostly doggerel. Many of the beings mentioned are to us now mere names, with no special information attached. Most of them were probably local deities, the personification of natural phenomena, guardian spirits, fairies, harpies, naiads, dryads, and many others, who are here represented as adherents of the Buddha, come to do him honour. It is noteworthy that even the most important gods -  e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varuna')"&gt;Varuna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka')"&gt;Brahmá&lt;/a&gt; -  are only incidentally mentioned, added to the list, as it were, without special distinction. A similar list of devas is found in the Mahavastu (i. 245; iii.68, 77); the addition of Siva to this list is significant. The list of gods given in the Mahásamaya should be compared with that given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aataanaatiya_s')"&gt;Atánátiya Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the sutta is the framework of the words attributed to the Buddha, introducing the list of devas, giving the Buddha's </data>
<data>warning to the monks to beware of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara')"&gt;Mára&lt;/a&gt; and Mára's declaration that he had no power over them as arahants are free from fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third part of the sutta may be called the prologue, the verses of greeting spoken by the devas from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhaavaasaa')"&gt;Suddhávásá&lt;/a&gt; (Rhys Davids, Dial.ii.282f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prologue is elsewhere preserved as a separate episode (S.i.27).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries give long accounts of the preaching of the Mahásamya (E.g., SNA. 357ff.; DA.ii.672ff). The arahants mentioned are Sákiyan and Koliyan youths, representatives of Sákiyan and Koliyan families, sent to join the Order as a sign of gratitude to the Buddha for having averted the quarrel between the two families regarding the water of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rohini')"&gt;Rohiní&lt;/a&gt;. On that occasion the Buddha had preached to the opposing armies the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/attadanda_s')"&gt;Attadanda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/phandana_jat_475')"&gt;Phandana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/latukika_jat_357')"&gt;Latukika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vattaka_jat_35_118_394')"&gt;Vattaka Játakas&lt;/a&gt; (DA.ii.674 adds the Pathavuddriyana and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rukkhadhamma_jat_074')"&gt;Rukkhadhamma Játakas&lt;/a&gt;). He then related the story of their origin, showing that both families were descended from a common stock. When the quarrel was thus settled, two hundred and fifty young men from each family entered the Order and the Buddha dwelt with them in Mahávana. But the wives of the men tried to entice them back; the Buddha, therefore, took them to Himavá, where he preached to them the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kunaala_jat_536')"&gt;Kunála Játaka&lt;/a&gt; on the banks of the Kunála Lake.

They assembled to pay homage to their teacher on the evening of the full moon day of Jetthamása, and to the assembly came the devas of the ten thousand world systems. The Buddha told the monks the names of the devas present (as given in the Mahásamaya), and, surveying the assembly, saw that it consisted of two kinds of beings, one capable of benefiting by his teaching (bhabbá), and the other not so capable (abhabbá). The bhabbá, he saw, could be divided into six groups -  the rágacaritá and the dosa moha vitakka saddhá buddhi caritá, according to temperament. To these, respectively, he preached six suttas, calculated to benefit each separate class, and, in order that each sutta might take the form of question and answer, he created a Buddha form to ask questions, while he himself answered them. The six suttas, so preached, were the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purabheda')"&gt;Purábheda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kalahavivaada_s')"&gt;Kalahaviváda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_viyuuha')"&gt;Cúlavyúha&lt;/a&gt;, Mahávyúha, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tuvataka_s')"&gt;Tuvataka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sammaparibbajaniya_s')"&gt;Sammáparibbájaniya&lt;/a&gt;. Countless numbers of beings realized the Truth (AA.i.173, 320; Mil. 20, 350; SNA.i.174).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preaching of the Mahásamaya Sutta was among the incidents of the Buddha's life sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the &lt;a href="mahathupa')"&gt;Mahá Thúpa&lt;/a&gt;.

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Maháli Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Maháli Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;The Licchavi Otthaddha (Maháli) visits the Buddha at the Kutágárasálá and reports to him a conversation he had had with Sunakkhatta, who claimed to be able to see heavenly forms but not to hear heavenly sounds. Maháli inquires how such a faculty can be acquired, and the Buddha tells him, but explains that it is not for the sake of acquiring these powers that people join the Order. Asking what then is their object, he gradually leads the conversation on to the question of arahantship, along the Eightfold Path. The Buddha then raises a quite different question, as to whether the soul and the body are identical. The discourse on this again leads to the question of arahantship (cp. Jáliya Sutta), but it is significant that the Buddha leaves this last question unanswered (D.i.150 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.316) that the Buddha raised the point of body and soul, because he knew that Maháli harboured the heretical belief that a soul exists and that it has form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Maháli Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;The Licchavi Maháli visits the Buddha at the Kútágárasálá and questions him regarding the doctrine of Púrana Kassapa that there is no cause or condition for the impurity of beings. The Buddha contradicts this view, and explains that it is because beings take delight in the body, etc., that they become impure. When they feel revulsion towards the body, etc., they become pure. S.iii.68f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Maháli Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;The Buddha, in answer to a question of Maháli, says that greed, ill will, dullness cause the continuance of evil action, and right reflection and a well poised mind cause the continuance of good. The existence of these two different sets of qualities cause the good and evil in the world. A.v.86f.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásuka Játaka (No. 429)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once king of the parrots and lived in a fig tree grove in the Himálaya. After some time the fruits of the trees on which he lived came to an end, but he still lived on there, eating bark or shoots or whatever else he could find. Sakka's throne was heated, and Sakka, assuming the form of a goose and accompanied by Sujá, visited the parrot and asked why he did not go elsewhere. The parrot answered that he did not wish to forsake old friends, and Sakka, pleased with this answer, promised him a boon. The parrot asked that the fig tree be made fruitful again, and this Sakka did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had a pleasant dwelling place near a village, but who found alms difficult to get, the villagers becoming very poor. He became very discontented, but the Buddha asked him not to forsake his dwelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sakka of the story is identified with Anuruddha (J.iii.490 4). According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.283ff), the story was related to Nigamavásí Tissa (q.v.) and Sakka is identified with Ananda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásílava Játaka (No. 51)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares under the name of Mahásílava. He built six almonries and ruled in all goodness. One of his ministers, having intrigued with a member of his harem, was expelled and took service under the king of Kosala. He caused several bands of ruffians to invade the territory of Mahásílava at different times. When they were caught and brought before Mahásílava, the latter gave them money and sent them away, telling them to act differently in the future. In this way the king of Kosala was easily persuaded by his minister that Mahásílava's kingdom could easily be captured. He therefore set out with an army, and as the people of Mahásílava were allowed to offer no resistance, the king and his ministers were captured alive and buried up to their necks in the cemetery. In the night, when jackals approached to eat them, Mahásílava fastened his teeth in the neck of the jackal that came to him. The jackal started howling and his companions fled. In his struggles to get free, the jackal loosened the earth round Mahásílava, who managed to free himself and then his companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cemetery two Yakkhas were having a dispute about a dead body, and they asked Mahásílava to settle it. But he wished first to bathe, and they fetched him water and perfumes and food from the usurper's table in Benares and also his sword of state. With this he cut the body in half, giving half to each Yakkha, and, with their aid, he entered the usurper's room where he slept. When the latter showed signs of terror, Mahásílava told him of what had happened and granted him forgiveness. His kingdom was then restored, and Mahásílava exhorted his subjects on the virtues of perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a backsliding monk. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; is </data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahásanghiká, Mahásangítiká&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Buddhist schools which separated out from the Theravádins at the Second Council. The members rejected the Parivára, the six sections of the Abhidhamma, the Patisambhidamagga, the Niddesa and some portions of the Játakas (KvuA. p. 4; Dpv.v.32ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school was so called owing to the great number of its followers, which made a great assembly or &quot;Mahásangití.&quot; They were counted among the Anátmavádins, and later gave rise to the following schools: the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahásanghika, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pubbasela, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Aparasela, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Rájagiriyá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Hemavatas, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Cetiyavádins, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sankantivádins and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Gokulikas. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally they had only two divisions   the Ekabbohárikas and Gokulikas (Rockhill, op. cit., 182ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their separation from the orthodox school was brought about by the Vajjiputta monks, and was probably due to difference of opinion on the ten points (for these see Vin.ii.294f) held by the Vajjiputta monks. According to Northern sources, however, the split occurred on the five points raised by Mahádeva: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) An arahant may commit a sin under unconscious   temptation; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) one may be an arahant and unconscious of the fact;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) an arahant may have doubts on matters of doctrine;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) one cannot attain arahantship without the help of a   teacher; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(5) the &quot;Noble Way&quot; may begin with some such   exclamation as &quot;How sad!&quot; uttered during meditation (J.R A.S. 1910, p. 416;   cf. MT 173). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These articles of faith are found in the Kathávatthu </data>
<data>(173ff., 187ff., 194, 197), attributed to the Pubbaselas and the Aparaselas, opponents of the Mahásanghika school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hiouen Thsang (Beal.ii.164), the Mahásanghikas divided their canon into five parts: Sútra, Vinaya, Abhidhamma, Miscellaneous and Dháraní. Fa Hsien took from Pátaliputta to China a complete transcript of the Mahásanghika Vinaya. (Giles, p. 64, Nañjio's Catalogue mentions a Mahásanghika Vinaya and a Mahásanghabhiksuní Vinaya in Chinese translations, Cola. 247, 253. Ms. No.543). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best known work of the Mahásanghikas is the Mahávastu. Their headquarters in Ceylon were in Abhayagiri vihára, and Sena I. is said to have built the Vírankuráráma for their use. Cv.1.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha tells him that Kusinárá was once Kusávatí, the royal city of King Mahásudassana, and was surrounded by seven ramparts, a city containing all the characteristics of a great capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahásudassana possessed the seven treasures of a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakkavatti&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkaratana')"&gt;cakka ratana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the hatthi ratana (named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uposatha')"&gt;Uposatha&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the assa ratana (named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/valaahaka')"&gt;Valáhaka&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the mani ratana, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the itthi ratana (pearl among women), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the gahapati ratana, and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the parináyaka ratana. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also possessed four iddhi powers: he was handsome, long lived, free from disease, and beloved by all classes of people. He had lotus ponds made all over his kingdom, food and clothing being placed on their banks for any who might require them. With the money brought to the king by the people, Vissakamma, under Sakka's orders, built the Dhammapásáda Palace, filled with all splendor and luxury. The king possessed a gabled hall called Mahávyúha, where he spent the hot part of the day. In front </data>
<data>of the Dhammapásáda was the Dhammapokkharaní.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having realized that his power and glory were the result of past good deeds, Mahásudassana practiced generosity, self conquest and self-control, and developed the four jhánas, suffusing all quarters with thoughts of love and pity and sympathy and equanimity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahásudassana had eighty four thousand cities, the chief of which was Kusávatí; eighty four thousand palaces, the chief being Dhammapásáda; eighty four thousand gabled houses, the chief being Mahávyúha; eighty four thousand state elephants, led by Uposatha; and eighty four thousand horses, led by Valáhaka. He had eighty four thousand chariots led by Vejayanta, and eighty four thousand wives, of whom Subbaddá was the chief. One day, the king realized that his death was approaching, and, when Subhaddá visited him to try and induce him to enjoy his pleasures, he stopped her, telling her to speak to him of the impermanence of things and the need for giving up all desire. While she talked to him of these things, he died and was reborn in the Brahma world. For eighty four thousand years be bad been a prince, a viceroy and a king respectively, and later, for forty eight thousand years, a devout layman in the Dhammapásáda. Mahásudassana is identified with the Buddha (D.ii.169 99; the story is also referred to at S.iii.144).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Sudassana had been a forester. He met a monk in the forest and built a hut for him. He also requested the monk to receive alms every day at his house or, at least, to eat there. The monk agreed, and Sudassana made his hut comfortable in every way, constructing walks, bathing places, gardens, etc., outside. He also gave him innumerable gifts, of various kinds and descriptions. DA.ii.631f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When he died the people were delighted, and burnt his body with one thousand cartloads of wood amidst great festivity. They then elected his son, the Bodhisatta, as king. He noticed that while all others rejoiced, the palace doorkeeper wept, and inquired the reason. The man replied that Mahápingala would strike him on the head in passing eight times a day. He was sure, he would treat Yama in like fashion, and would be banished from hell and return to his palace where he would again start to assault him. The Bodhisatta told the man it would be quite impossible for Mahápingala to rise from hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the great joy shown by multitudes of people at the death of Devadatta.

On his death, the elder came to the throne and made his brother viceroy, but, later, suspecting him of treachery, had him put in chains. Polajanaka escaped, and, when he had completed his preparations, laid siege to the city, killed Aritthajanaka, and seized the throne. Aritthajanaka's wife escaped in disguise, taking with her a lot of treasures. She was pregnant, and as her child was the Bodhisatta, Sakka's throne was heated, and he appeared before her as a charioteer and took her to Kálacampá. There she was adopted by an Udicca brahmin as his sister and the child was born. When he played with other boys they mocked at him, calling him the widow's son. He asked his mother what this meant, but she put him off with evasive answers until one day he bit her on the breast and insisted on being told the truth. When he was sixteen, she gave him half the treasures, and he embarked on a ship going to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannabhuumi')"&gt;Suvannabhúmi&lt;/a&gt; for trade. The ship was wrecked in mid ocean, but nothing daunted, Mahájanaka (as the boy was called) swam valiantly for seven days, till &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/manimekhalaa')"&gt;Manimekkhalá&lt;/a&gt;, goddess of the sea, admiring his courage, rescued him and placed him in the mango grove in Mithilá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Polajanaka had died and left orders that the throne should go to one who could find favour in the eyes of his daughter, should know which is the head of a square bed, could string the bow that </data>
<data>required the strength of one thousand men, and could draw out the sixteen great treasures. No one seemed forthcoming who was able to fulfil these conditions; the ministers thereupon decked the state chariot with the five insignia of royalty and sent it out, accompanied by music. The car left the city gates, and the horses went to the mango grove and stopped at the spot where Mahájanaka lay asleep. The chaplain, seeing the auspicious marks on his feet, awoke him, and explaining to him his mission, crowned him king. When he entered the palace, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siivalii')"&gt;Sívalí&lt;/a&gt; (the late king's daughter) was immediately won over by his appearance, and willingly agreed to be his queen. He was told of the other conditions mentioned by the dead king; he solved the riddles contained in some and fulfilled them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In time Sívalí bore him a son, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighaavu')"&gt;Díghávukumára&lt;/a&gt;, whom, in due course, Mahájanaka made viceroy. One day Mahájanaka went into his park, and noticing how a mango tree, which bore fruit had been plundered by his courtiers while another which was barren was left in peace, he realized that possessions meant sorrow, and retiring into a room, lived the ascetic life. His life span was ten thousand years, of which three thousand still remained to him. After living for four months in the palace, he resolved to renounce the world, and having made his preparations, secretly left the palace. The queen met him on the stairs, but did not recognise him in his ascetic garb. On discovering his absence, she ran after him and tried by many devices to persuade him to return, but in vain. She then urged his people to follow him, but he turned them back. She, however, would not obey him, and for sixty leagues she and the people followed Mahájanaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sage Nárada, dwelling in Himavá, saw Mahájanaka with </data>
<data>his divine eye and encouraged him in his resolve, as did another ascetic, Migájina, who had just risen from a trance. Thus they journeyed on till they reached the village of Thúná. There the king saw a dog running away with a morsel of roasted flesh, which it dropped in its flight. The king picked it up, cleaned it, and ate it. The queen, very disgusted, felt that he was not worthy to be a king. Further on they saw a girl shaking sand in a winnowing basket; on one arm she wore a single bracelet, on the other arm, two. The two bracelets jingled, while the single one was noiseless. Mahájanaka pointed out the moral of this to Sívalí, and she agreed to go a different way, but soon came running back to him and followed him till they came across a fletcher, straightening an arrow, looking at it  with one eye only. On being questioned by the king, he answered that the wide horizon of two eyes served but to distract the view. But Sívalí still refused to leave him till, on the edge of a forest, he told her there could be no more intercourse between them, and she fell senseless. The king rushed into the forest, while the ministers revived the queen. When she recovered the king was no more to be seen, and she returned to the city. Thúpas were erected on various spots connected with the king's renunciation, and the queen lived as an ascetic in the royal garden of Mithilá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the Buddha’s Renunciation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Manimekhálá is identified with Uppalavanná,   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Nárada with Sáriputta, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Migájina with Moggallána, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the girl with Khemá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the fletcher with Ananda, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sívalí with Ráhulamátá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Díghávu with Ráhula, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;while Mahájanaka was the Bodhisatta (J.iii.30 68).</data>

Sáriputta is visited by the others in the evening, and asks them what type of monk would illumine the Gosinga wood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ananda speaks of one who treasures what he has been   taught and learns by heart the doctrines which declare the higher life in all   its perfection and purity; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Revata of one who delights in meditation and lives in   solitude; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Anuruddha of one who possesses the celestial eye;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahá Kassapa of one living in the forest a strenuous   life, recommends that life; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Moggallána, of one who holds discussions with another   on the Abhidhamma; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sáriputta of a monk who is master of his heart and is   not under its mastery. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;They all seek the Buddha and ask for his opinion. He praises the opinion of each of the Elders, but he himself would choose a monk who is delivered from the ásavas. M.i.212-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Mahápaduma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pacceka Buddha, chief of five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, all sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumavati')"&gt;Padumavatí&lt;/a&gt;. He alone was born of his mother's womb, the others being samsedajá. After Padumavatí's rivals (for the earlier part of their story see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uppalavanna')"&gt;Uppalavanná&lt;/a&gt;) had placed the children in caskets which they launched down stream, they announced to the king that Padumavatí was a non human and had given birth to a log of wood. He expelled her from the palace, and as she wandered about in the streets, deprived of all her glory, an old woman had pity on her, took her home, and looked after her. The king was bathing in the river when the caskets containing the children got entangled in his nets, and, having taken them out and unlocked them, he found the babes inside, together with a letter from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; saying that they were the children of Padumavatí. The king hastened back to his palace and issued a proclamation that anyone finding Padumavatí would receive one thousand as reward. On Padumavatí's suggestion, the old woman, her protector, offered to find her, and Padumavatí then revealed herself. She was conducted back to the palace in all glory, and her five hundred rivals were given to her as slaves. She had them freed, and appointed them as nurses to look after her children, except Paduma (called Mahápaduma), whom she nursed herself. When Mahápaduma and his brothers reached the age of sixteen, they went one day to the park, where they were impressed by the appearance of old and faded lotus among the fresh ones growing in the pond, and developing this topic of thought, they became Pacceka Buddhas and went to Nandamúla cave. Padumavatí died of grief </data>
<data>at the loss of all her sons and was reborn in a labourer's family. She married, and, one day, while taking gruel to her husband, she saw eight Pacceka Buddhas (her sons in a previous birth) travelling through the air and descending near to where she stood. She gave them the food intended for her husband and invited them for the next day. The next day all the five hundred came to do honour to their mother and to accept her entertainment. She fed them all and offered flowers to them (ThigA.185ff). Afterwards Mahápaduma and his brothers were entertained by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares, and his queen (who in their last birth were &lt;a href="maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhadda_kapilani_thi')"&gt;Bhaddá Kápilání&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They stayed in the royal park during the rains, and, one day, when the king was away, the queen visited them and found them dead. ThagA.ii.140f.; SA.ii.142; AA.i.98,190ff.; MA.ii.889.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahápaduma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prince of Kumudanagara. Sona Thera -  who harboured enmity against Piyadassí Buddha, just as Devadatta did against Gotama -  persuaded Paduma to kill his father, and devised various schemes for killing the Buddha, all of which failed. In the end he sent his elephant Donamukha, drunk with toddy, to attack the Buddha, who, however, subdued the animal. BuA.174; cp. Ajátasattu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahápaduma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pacceka Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk, but was later reborn as a Treasurer of Benares, in which life he committed adultery and was reborn in hell. Later, he became the daughter of a treasurer and was given in marriage. But, owing to her former misdeeds, her husband did not care for her and went with another woman to the fair. One day, however, she </data>
<data>begged her husband to take her, and he told her to make preparations. This she did, and on the day of the feast, hearing that her husband had already gone to the park, she followed him with her servants, taking the food and drink she had prepared. On the way she met a Pacceka Buddha, descended from her carriage, filled his bowl with food, placing a lotus on the top, and then offered him a handful of lotus. When her gift was accepted, she made a vow that she should be born in a lotus and be of a lotus colour, should become a man and attain the deliverance of Nibbána. Her body instantly became beautiful, and her husband, who suddenly remembered her, sent for her, and from then on loved her exceedingly. After death she was born in a lotus in the deva world and was called Mahápaduma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his next birth, at the suggestion of Sakka, he was born in a lotus in the park of the king of Benares, whose queen was childless. She saw the lotus in the pond, and conceiving a great affection for it, picked it and found the child within as if in a casket. She adopted the child and brought him up in great luxury.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, while playing outside the palace gates, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and warned him not to enter the palace as they pressed all who entered to eat and drink. The Pacceka Buddha turned away, and the boy was filled with remorse at the idea that the Pacceka Buddha should be offended, and went to his lodging, riding on an elephant, to ask his forgiveness. On the way he descended from the elephant and went on foot. Arrived near the dwelling of the Pacceka Buddha, he dismissed his attendants and went on alone. He found the Pacceka Buddha's cell empty, and, sitting down, developed insight and became a Pacceka Buddha. When his attendants came for him, he declared his attainment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His verse is included in the</data>

He was a pupil of Upatissa and colleague of Mahásumma (Sp.i.263).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahápaduma's opinions are often quoted in the Samantapásádiká. i. 184, 283; ii.368, 471; iii.536, 538, 588, 596, 609, 644, 651, 683, 715; iv.819, 827, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when Vasabha's queen was ill, a woman of the court was sent to Mahápaduma for a remedy, he being evidently skilled in medicine. The Thera would not prescribe, but explained to his fellow monks what should be done in the case of such an illness. The remedy was applied in the case of the queen and she recovered. Later, she visited the Thera, and offered him three robes and a medicine chest containing three hundred kahápanas; this she placed at his feet, requesting that he should offer flowers in her name. The Elder accepted the gift and spent the money on offerings of flowers. Sp.ii.471.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Mahápaduma. &lt;/b&gt;The Bodhisatta. See the </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahánidána Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifteenth Sutta of the Dígha Nikáya, preached to Ananda at Kammássadamma in the Kuru country. Ananda says that the doctrine of events as arising from causes is quite clear to him; that it only appears deep. &quot;Say not so,&quot; warns the Buddha, and proceeds to give a detailed exposition of the Paticcasamuppáda, or Chain of Causation, as it comes later to be called, explaining how each link in the chain of samsára is both the effect of one factor and the cause of another. The Sutta also discusses the idea of &quot;soul,&quot; the seven resting places of cognition (viññánatthiti), the two spheres (áyatana), and the eight kinds of deliverance (vimokkha). D.ii.55-71; Thomas: cp. Cit.,197.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khemá had heard the Mahánidána Sutta in the time of Kassapa Buddha (Ap.ii.546, vs.34). On hearing it again, preached by Gotama, she revived her memory and became an arahant. Apii.549, vs.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahávánija Játaka (No. 493)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company of merchants once went astray in the forest without food or water, and, seeing a huge banyan-tree with moist branches, they out off a branch and water poured out, from another branch came food, from another a company of girls, and from the fourth various precious things. Overcome by greed, they wished to cut the tree from its roots in order to get more. Their leader, the Bodhisatta, tried to prevent this, but they refused to listen. Then the Nága king who lived in the tree, ordered his followers to slay all the merchants except the leader. Him the Nágas escorted to his home with all the treasures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a company of merchants from Sávatthi, followers of the Buddha, who had a similar experience. But having moderate desires, they made no attempt to cut down the tree. Then they returned to Sávatthi, and, offering some of the precious things to the Buddha, made over the merit thereof to the deity of the tree. The Buddha praised them for their moderation. Sáriputta is identified with the Nága king. J.iv.350ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He came, with forty thousand others, from Dakkhinágiri vikára in Ujjeni, to the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxix.35) and took up his position at the western entrance. MT. 530.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Tissabhúti went to him, on finding his mind corrupted by sinful thoughts, and having received from Sangharakkhita a topic of meditation, he attained to arahantship (AA.i.23f.; MA.i.55). He was one of the last of the arahants. J. L. Makárakkhira.&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;J.iv.490; vi.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

Mahá Sangharakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; When over sixty years old and about to die, his companions questioned him on his transcendental attainment. &quot;I have none,&quot; he replied. A young monk who waited on him said that people had come from twelve yojanas round in the belief that he had attained Nibbána. He then asked that he should be raised up and left alone. As soon as the others left him, he snapped his fingers to show that he had attained arahantship. He confessed that he had never done anything without mindfulness and understanding. His nephew also attained arahantship only after fifty years of age. Vsm.47f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá Kotthita (Mahá Kotthika) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, ranked foremost among masters of logical analysis (patisambhidappattánam) (A.i.24; Dpv.iv.5; v. 9). He was born into a very wealthy brahmin family of Sávatthi, his father being Assaláyana and his mother Candavatí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gained great proficiency in the Vedas and, after hearing the Buddha preach (to his father, says the Apadána account), entered the Order and, engaging in meditation, soon became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was extremely skilled in knowledge of the Patisambhidá, on which were based all his questions to the Buddha and his own colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a rich householder, and, hearing the Buddha praise a monk as foremost among those skilled in the Patisambhidá, he wished for similar eminence for himself in the future. To this end he visited the Buddha and his monks and entertained them for seven days, giving them three robes each at the conclusion of his almsgiving. Owing to the skill showed by him in the Mahá Veddha Sutta (q.v.), the Buddha declared him foremost among those skilled in the Patisambhidá (Thag.vs.2; ThagA.i.29ff.; AA.i.159; Ap.ii.479; also Avadánas ii.195).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several instances are given of discussions between Kotthita and other eminent theras -  e.g., the Nalakalápiya Sutta on kamma (S.ii.112f), the Síla Sutta on religious discipline (S.iii.165ff), three suttas on samudayadhamma (the nature of arising), two on assáda (satisfaction) (S.iii.172-7), two on samudaya (arising) (S.iii.173) and three on avijjá and vijjá (S.iii.17). Another similar sutta is on sense and sense objects (S.iv.162-5), and there is a series of suttas on matters not revealed by the Buddha (avyákatáni). S.iv.384-91; Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests </data>
<data>(KS.i.79i n.1) that all these suttas were compiled rather as &quot;lessons&quot; to be learnt than as genuine inquiries by Kotthita. The pre eminent monks were &quot;playing&quot; at teacher and pupil in order to aid Kotthita to win proficiency as a teacher. Another such &quot;lesson&quot; is given at A.iv.382ff., as to the motives guiding those who live the brahmacariya life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these suttas took the form of discussions with Sáriputta, in which Mahá Kotthita is the questioner and Sáriputta the instructor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sutta (S.iv.145 7) records a &quot;lesson&quot; given by the Buddha to Kotthita on conceptions of anicca, dukkha and anattá. The Anguttara Nikáya (see the Káyasakkhi Sutta, A.i.118f) records a discussion at Jetavana between Savittha, Kotthita and Sáriputta, as to who is best: one who has testified to the truth with body, one who has won view, or one released by faith. Another discussion (A.ii.161f) takes place between Sáriputta and Kotthita as to whether anything continues to exist after the ending of the six spheres of contact (Nibbána). Once there was a dispute between Kotthita and Citta Hatthisáriputta; Citta was constantly interrupting the elder monks who were gathered at Isipatana for the discussion of the Abhidhamma, and was asked by Kotthita to abide his time and not interrupt. Citta's friends protested that Citta was well qualified to take part in the discussion; but Kotthita declared that, far from being wise enough, Citta would, not long after, renounce the Order. And so it happened (A.iii.392ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta evidently had a great regard for Kotthita; the Theragáthá (Thag.vss.1006 8; ThagA.ii.117) contains three stanzas in which Sáriputta proclaims his excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá Kaccána, Kaccáyana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha, considered chief among expounders in full of the brief saying of the Buddha, (sankhittena bhásitassa vitthárena attham vibhajantánam) (A.i.23). He was born at Ujjení in the family of the chaplain of King Candappajjota, and was called Kaccána both because of his golden colour and because Kaccána was the name of his gotta. He studied the Vedas, and, on the death of his father, succeeded him as chaplain. With seven others he visited the Buddha, at the request of Candappajjota, to invite him to come to Ujjení. Kaccána and his friends listened to the Buddha's sermon, and having attained arahantship, joined the order. He then conveyed the king's invitation to the Buddha, who pointed out that it would now suffice if Kaccána himself returned to Ujjení.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaccána accordingly set out for Ujjení with his seven companions, accepting alms on the way at the house of a very poor girl of Telappanáli, who later became Candappajjota's queen. For details see Telappanáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrived in Ujjení, Kaccána lived in the royal park, where the king showed him all honour. He preached constantly to the people, and, attracted by his discourses, numerous persons joined the Order, so that the whole city was one blaze of orange robes. It is said that after having duly established the sásana in Avantí, Kaccána returned once more to the Buddha. (Thus, the explanation of the Madhupindika Sutta was given at Kapilavatthu). Candappajjota consulted him on various occasions, and among the verses attributed to him in the Theragáthá (Thag.vss.494 501), are several addressed to the king himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the time of Padumuttara Buddha that Kaccána had made his resolve to win the eminence he did, after listening to Padumuttara's </data>
<data>praise of a monk, also named Kaccána, for similar proficiency. Kaccána was then a vijjádhara, and offered the Buddha three kanikára flowers. So says the Apadána ii.463, but ThagA. says he was a vijjádhara in the time of Sumedhá Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a householder of Benares, and offered a golden brick, worth one hundred thousand, to the cetiya which was being built over the Buddha's remains, and then made a vow that in future births his body should be golden (ThagA.i.483f.; AA.i.117f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Apadána (Ap.ii.465), Kaccána's father was called Tirítivaccha (or Tidivavaccha), and his mother Candapadumá. There is another account of Mahá Kaccána in the Apadána (A.i.84f), in which it is said that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha he built a yandhakuti named Paduma in the shape of a lotus and covered with lotus flowers, and that thirty kappas later he became king under the name of Pabhassara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three suttas are mentioned (AA.i.118) as having obtained for Kaccána his title of eminence -  the Madhupindika, the Kaccáyana and the Paráyana; several instances are given of people seeking Mahá Kaccána's assistance, for a detailed explanation of something said in brief by the Buddha - e.g., Háliddikáni, Kálí, Samiddhi, Uttara and Valliya (see also A.iii.314, 321; v. 225; M.iii.223). Among Kaccána's pupils and followers and those who consulted him were Sonakutikanna, Isidatta, Avantiputta, Lohicca, Arámadanda, and Kandaráyana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Avanti, Kaccána is said to have stayed, not in the king's park, where he lived soon after his return from the Buddha, but chiefly in the Kuraraghara papátá (E.g., S.iii.9; A.v.46; Ud.v.6; Vin.i.194; DhA.iv.101) and in a hut in Makkarakata forest. S.iv.116; see also VvA.259, according to which he stayed near Potali. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is also made of his staying at Varaná on the bank </data>
<data>of Kaddamadaha (A.i.65); at the Gundávana in Madhurá (A.i.67; M.ii.83); at Tapodá in Rájagaha (A.iii.192), in Soreyya (DhA.i.325; for a curious incident connected with Kaccána's visit see Soreyya), and in Kosambí (PvA. 140). According to Dvy. (551, 585, 586) he also stayed in Roruka. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DhA.ii.176) that even when Kaccána was living at Avanti, a long distance away, he went regularly to hear the Buddha preach, and when the chief theras took their places in the assembly, they always left room for him. On one such occasion Sakka showed him great honour, falling at his feet, and the Buddha explained that this was because Mahá Kaccána kept his senses well guarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.854) records a curious story in reference to Kaccána. Vassakára, minister of Ajátasattu, saw Kaccána descending Gijjhakúta and said he looked like a monkey. The Buddha read Vassakára's thoughts, and warned him that after death he would be born as a monkey in Veluvana. He believed the Buddha, and made provision in Veluvana for his future comfort as monkey. And this be did indeed become, living in Veluvana and answering to the name of Vassakára!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaccána is identified with the charioteer in the Kurudhamma Játaka (J.ii.181), and with Devala in the Sarabhanga Játaka (J.v.151).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to tradition, Kaccána was the author of the Nettippakarana, the Páli grammar bearing his name, and of the Petakopadesa. It is probable that these works were the compilations of a school, which traced its descent to Mahá Kaccána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Madhura Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Mahá-Satipatthána Sutta  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Kammássadamma in the Kuru country. The Buddha tells the monks that the one and only path leading to Nibbána is that of the Four Bases of Mindfulness. These, in brief, are the four ways of directing the mind to the impurities and the impermanency of body:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) káya, physical structure and activities;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) vedaná, the emotional nature, first as bare feeling, then as having ethical implications;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) citta, conscious life or intelligence, considered under ethical aspects;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) dhamma, considered under the five hindrances; the five groups (khandhas), the six spheres of sense, the seven bojjhangas, and the four Ariyan Truths. D.ii.290 315.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is considered as one of the most important in the Buddhist Canon. It has been translated into various languages, and several commentaries on it are in existence. Its mere recital is said to ward off dangers and to bring happiness, and it is the desire of every Buddhist that he shall die with the Satipatthána Sutta on his lips, or, at least, with the sound of it in his ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The materials found in the Mahásatipatthána Sutta are found also in the Majjhima Nikáya, broken up into two portions, each representing a separate discourse -  the Satipatthána Sutta and the Saccavibhanga Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahásutasoma Játaka (No. 537)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmadatta')"&gt;Brahmadatta&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares, was much addicted to meat. One uposatha day the meat which had been prepared for him was eaten by dogs, and the cook, unable to buy any more, cut a piece from a human body recently dead and cooked it. Brahmadatta had been a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yakkha')"&gt;Yakkha&lt;/a&gt; in a former birth and therefore enjoyed the dish. Having discovered what the meat was, he developed a taste for human flesh, and, in due course, came to having his subjects murdered in order to supply him with food. His crime was discovered and his guilt brought home by his commander in chief, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalahatthi')"&gt;Kálahatthí&lt;/a&gt;, but the king refused to give up his cannibalism and was driven out of the kingdom. Kálahatthi relates various stories to the king, showing the folly of his behaviour &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-  e.g., the story of the fish Ananda, of Sujáta's son, of the geese who lived in Cittakúta and of the Unnábhi&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;spider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king dwelt in the forests with his cooks, eating all the travelers they were able to seize. The day arrived when he killed the cook himself and ate his flesh. Some time after he fell upon a brahmin traveling through the forest with a large retinue, and they gave chase to the king. As he ran an acacia splinter pierced his foot, causing him great pain. Seeing a banyan tree, he made a vow to bathe its trunk with the blood of one hundred and one princes if his foot were healed in seven days. The foot did heal within that time, and with the assistance of a Yakkha, who had been his friend in a previous birth, he managed to capture one hundred kings whom he hung on the tree by means of cords passed through their hands.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The deity of the tree was alarmed and, on the advice of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;, appeared before the man eater (who is called in the context Porisáda) and demanded that he should bring Sutasoma, Prince of Kuru, to complete the number of his victims. Sutasoma had been the man eater's friend and private tutor (pitthácariya) at Takkasilá. Anxious to appease the deity, the man eater went to Sutasoma's park and there waited for him hidden in the pond, when Sutasoma came to take his ceremonial bath on the festival day of Phussa. On the way to the park, Sutasoma met a brahmin, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, who offered, for four thousand pieces, to teach him four verses learnt from Kassapa Buddha. Sutasoma promised to learn them on his return from the park, but there he was caught by the Porisáda. Promising to return to the Porisáda, Sutasoma obtained leave to keep his appointment with Nanda. This promise fulfilled, Sutasoma returned to the Porisáda and went with him to the banyan tree. There he told the Porisáda of the verses he had learnt from Nanda, reciting them to him, and discoursing on the virtues of Truth. The Porisáda was greatly pleased and offered Sutasoma four boons. Sutasoma chose as his first boon that the Porisáda should live for one hundred years; as his second that the captive kings should be released; as his third, that their kingdoms should be restored; and as his fourth that the Porisáda should give up his cannibalism. Only very reluctantly did the Porisáda agree to the fourth. Sutasoma then took him back to Benares, where he restored to him his kingdom, having first assured the people that the king would never return to his former vicious habits. Sutasoma then returned to Indapatta. In gratitude for the tree sprite's intervention, a lake was dug near the banyan tree and a village founded near by, </data>
<data>whose inhabitants were required to make offerings to the tree. This village, built on the spot where the Porisáda was converted, came to be called Kammásadamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Buddha's conversion of Angulimála, with whom the man eater is identified. Kálahatthi was Sáriputta, Nanda was Ananda, the tree sprite was Kassapa, Sakka was Anuruddha, and Sutasoma the Bodhisatta. J.v.456 511; cp. Játakamála xxxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutasomacariyá is given in the Cariyápitaka iii.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Mahá Abhaya-Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually called Dighabhánaka Abhaya. He was evidently an eminent Thera. It is said (Sp.ii.474f.; referred to at DhSA.399) that when news arrived that the brigand Abhaya was coming to Cetiyagiri to pillage it, the patrons of the vihára informed Abhaya Thera of this. He asked them to collect various kinds of food and drink wherewith to entertain the brigand. The latter was greatly pleased, and, on learning that this hospitality was shown him at the instigation of Abhaya Thera, he visited the Elder and took upon himself the protection of the vihára from all danger. Later the monks questioned the right of the Elder to entertain a robber with what belonged to the vihára, but he convened an assembly of the monks and convinced them that he was guiltless, as his act had been solely for the protection of the belongings of the Sangha. This story shows that the Elder lived at Cetiyagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion (MA.i.65f) Abhaya Thera preached the Mahá Ariyavamsa patipadá, and the whole village (? Mahágáma) came to hear him. After the sermon he received great honour. An elderly monk was full of envy and abused him, saying that under guise of preaching he had filled the night with noise. The two monks had to travel along the same road for the distance of a gávuta, and all the way the old monk abused Abhaya. When their roads separated, Abhaya worshipped the monk and took leave of him and said, when asked later, that he had heard none of the abuse because he had been all the time engaged in meditation. One day, a certain woman who had come all the way from Ullabha kolakanniká, a distance of five leagues, to hear </data>
<data>Abhaya preach the Ariyavamsa, found that he was about to arise without finishing the sermon, and reminded him that he was omitting the most important part. The monk praised her and continued to preach till dawn, when the woman became a sotápanna (AA.i.386). It is said that once Abhaya wanted to know if a certain pindapátika monk were a putthujjana or not. While this monk was bathing at the mouth of the Kalyání River, Abhaya told a novice to dive into the water and catch hold of his foot. The monk, thinking it was a crocodile, screamed with fear, and Abhaya knew that he was a puthujjana (MA.ii.869). Thieves once bound an Elder with creepers and made him lie down. A jungle fire spread to him, but before the creepers could be cut, he established insight and died an arahant. Abhaya, coming along with five hundred others, saw the body, cremated it, and had a shrine built over the remains (Vsm.36).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhaya's opinion was evidently greatly respected, and he is mentioned as having been consulted by Maha Dhammarakhita (VibhA.81) and Mallaka (Vsm.266) on problems connected with the Abhidhamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhaya is mentioned among those who could remember very early incidents in their lives. When he was only nine days old, his mother bent down to embrace him, but her hair became loose and the sumana-flowers she wore on her head fell on him, hurting him. In later life he could remember this incident. DA.ii.530; MNidA.234.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahá-Abhaya&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk of Uddalokaka Vihára.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahá Moggallána Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second of the Chief Disciples of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. He was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kolitagaama')"&gt;Kolitagáma&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;, on the same day as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; (they were both older than the Buddha), and was called Kolita after his village. His mother was a brahminee called Moggalí (Moggalláni), and his father was the chief, householder of the village. Moggallána's and Sáriputta's families had maintained an unbroken friendship for seven generations, and so the children were friends from their childhood. Sáriputta had five hundred golden palanquins and Moggallána five hundred carriages drawn by thoroughbreds. One day the two friends went together to see a mime play (giraggasamajjá), and there, realizing the impermanence of things, decided to renounce the world. They first lived as disciples of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjaya')"&gt;Sañjaya&lt;/a&gt;, and then wandered all over &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')"&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/a&gt;, discussing with all learned men, but finding no satisfaction. Then they separated, after agreeing that whoever first succeeded in finding what they sought should inform the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some time, Sáriputta, wandering about in Rájagaha, met  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assaji')"&gt;Assaji&lt;/a&gt;, was converted by him to the faith of the Buddha, and became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. He found Moggallána and repeated the stanza he had heard from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assaji')"&gt;Assaji&lt;/a&gt; (ye dhammá hetuppabhavá, etc.), and Moggallána also became a sotápanna. The two then resolved to visit the Buddha at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt;, after an unsuccessful attempt to </data>
<data>persuade Sañjaya to accompany them. Sañjaya's disciples, however, five hundred in number, agreed to go, and they all arrived at Veluvana. The Buddha preached to them, and ordained them by the &quot;ehi bhikkhu pabbajjá.&quot; All became arahants except Sáriputta and Moggallána. Moggallána went to the hamlet of Kallavála (for details see Pacala Sutta, A.iv.85f, where the village is called Kallaválamutta) in Magadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness overcame him as he sat meditating. The Buddha knew this, and appearing before him, exhorted him to be zealous. That very day he attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day that Sáriputta and Moggallána were ordained, the Buddha announced in the assembly of monks that he had assigned to them the place of Chief Disciples and then recited the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patimokkha')"&gt;Pátimokkha&lt;/a&gt;. The monks were offended that newcomers should be shown such great honour. But the Buddha told them how these two had for a whole asankheyya and one hundred thousand years strenuously exerted themselves to win this great eminence under him. They had made the first resolve in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anomadassii')"&gt;Anomadassí&lt;/a&gt; Buddha. Moggallána had been a householder, named Sirivaddha, and Sáriputta a householder, called Sarada. Sarada gave away his immense wealth and became an ascetic. The Buddha visited him in his hermitage, where Sarada and his seventy four thousand pupils showed him great honour. Anomadassí's chief disciple, Nisabha, gave thanks, and Sarada made a vow that he would become the chief disciple of some future Buddha. Anomadassí saw that his wish would be fulfilled and told him so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's departure, Sarada went to Sirivaddka, and, announcing the Buddha's prophecy, advised Sirivaddha to wish for the place of second disciple. Acting on this advice, Sirivaddha made elaborate </data>
<data>preparations and entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days. At the end of that time, he announced his wish to the Buddha, who declared that it would be fulfilled. From that time, the two friends, in that and subsequent births, engaged in good deeds. AA.i.84ff.; Ap.ii.31ff.; DhA.i.73f.; SNA.i.326ff.; the story of the present is given in brief at Vin.i.39ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta and Moggallána are declared to be the ideal disciples, whose example others should try to follow (E.g., S.ii.235; A.i.88). In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saccavibhanga_sutta')"&gt;Saccavibhanga Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.248) the Buddha thus distinguishes these &quot;twin brethren&quot; from the others: &quot;Sáriputta is as she who brings forth and Moggallána is as the nurse of what is brought forth; Sáriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallána trains in the highest good. Sáriputta is able to teach and make plain the four Noble Truths; Moggallána, on the other hand, teaches by his &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/n_r/paatihariya')"&gt;iddhi-pátiháriya&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; (BuA.31) Moggallána's pre eminence lay in his possession of iddhi power (A.i.23). He could create a living shape innumerable times and could transfer himself into any shape at will. Thag.vs.1183; he is recorded as saying that he could crush &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sineru')"&gt;Sineru&lt;/a&gt; like a kidney bean (DhA.iii.212), and, rolling the earth like a mat between his fingers, could make it rotate like a potter's wheel, or could place the earth on Sineru like an umbrella on its stand. When the Buddha and his monks failed to get alms in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veranjaa')"&gt;Verañjá&lt;/a&gt;, Moggallána offered to turn the earth upside down, so that the essence of the earth, which lay on the under surface, might serve as food. He also offered to open a way from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nalerupucimanda')"&gt;Nalerupu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nalerupucimanda')"&gt;-cimanda&lt;/a&gt; </data>
<data>to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarakuru')"&gt;Uttarakuru&lt;/a&gt;, that the monks might easily go there for alms; but this offer was refused by the Buddha (Vin.iii.7; Sp.i.182f.; DhA.ii.153). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several instances are given of this special display of iddhi. Once, at the Buddha's request, with his great toe he shook the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada')"&gt;Migáramátupásáda&lt;/a&gt;, and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper storey. See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasadakampana')"&gt;Pasádakampana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, S.v.269ff.; also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/utthaana_s')"&gt;Utthána Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, SNA.i.336f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, when Moggallána visited &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; to find out if he had profited by the Buddha's teaching, he found him far too proud and obsessed by the thought of his own splendour. He thereupon shook Sakka's palace, Vejayanta, till Sakka's hair stood on end with fright and his pride was humbled (See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_tanhaasankhaya_s')"&gt;Cúlatanhásankhaya Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, M.i.251ff). Again, Moggallána is mentioned as visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance of Baka Brahmá. He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the Sudhammá-Hall in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views were erroneous. Thag.vs.1198; ThagA.ii.185; S.i.144f. ; other visits of his to the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa Brahmá (A.iii.331ff.; iv.75ff.; cp. Mtu.i.54ff.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Máratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.332ff) we are told how Mára worried Moggallána by entering into his belly, but Moggallána ordered him out and told him how he himself had once been a Mára named Dúsí whose sister </data>
<data>Kálí was the mother of the present Mára. Dúsí incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, according to the Commentaries (E.g., ThagA.ii.188ff), Moggallána's greatest exhibition of iddhi power was the subjugation of the Nága Nandopananda. No other monk could have survived the ordeal because no other was able to enter so rapidly into the fourth jhána; which was the reason why the Buddha would give permission to no other monk but Moggallána to quell the Nága's pride. Similar, in many ways, was his subjection of the Nága who lived near the hermitage of Aggidatta (DhA.iii.242) (q.v.). Moggallána could see, without entering into any special state of mind, petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye (See, e.g., DhA.ii.64; iii.60, 410f., 479; S.ii.254ff.; where he saw petas while in the company of Lakkhana; cp. Avadánas i.246ff.). He would visit various worlds and bring back to the Buddha reports of their inhabitants (see also Mtu.i.4ff. regarding his visit to the Nirayas), which the Buddha used in illustration of his sermons. The Vimánavatthu (see also DhA.iii.291, re Nandiya, and iii.314) contains a collection of stories of such visits, and we are told (S.v.366f) that Moggallána's visits to the deva worlds-  e.g., that to Távatimsa   were very welcome to the devas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Moggallána's pre eminence was in iddhi power, yet in wisdom, too, he was second only to Sáriputta. These two could answer questions within the range of no other disciple of the Buddha (DhA.iii.227). The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggallána's powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the Sákyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggallána, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary. And Moggallána spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of </data>
<data>them. At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly (S.iv.183ff). Mention is made elsewhere (S.iv.262-9) of eloquent sermons preached by him on the jhánas, on qualities which lead to true emancipation (A.v.155ff), and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach. Other devas also went to hear him -  e.g., Candana, Suyáma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti (S.iv. 269 80). He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta (E.g., S.iv.391ff), and Vappa (A.ii.196ff), eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha. When the Buddha went to preach the Abhidhamma in Távatimsa, it was to Moggallána that he entrusted the task of preaching to the people who were waiting for his return. Moggallána, therefore, provided for these people spiritually, while Anáthapindika looked after their bodily needs (DhA.iii.219). When the time drew near for the Buddha's return, Moggallána, at the request of the people, went to Távatimsa, diving into the earth and climbing Sineru, in full view of them all, in order to find out what the Buddha intended doing, so that the people might be kept informed (DhA.224; J.iv.265; cp. Dvy.375). No task, which he might be told by the Buddha to perform, seemed to Moggallána too insignificant. Thus we find him employed by the Buddha as messenger to the arahant Uggasena, telling him that the Buddha wished to see him (Ibid., iv.62). He was also sent to Sakkhara, to Macchariya Kosiya, to check his miserliness and bring him to Jetavana (Ibid., i.369f.; J.i.347); and to Sílavá, whom Ajátasattu was plotting to kill (ThagA.i.536). When Visakhá was building the Migáramátupásáda and the Buddha was away on one of his journeys, Moggallána, because of his iddhi power, and five hundred monks were left to supervise the work, which was carried through without difficulty (DhA.i.414f). The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief </data>
<data>disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure. There is one instance recorded of Moggallána seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door (A.iv.204ff.). Once, when a monk charged Sáriputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggallána and Ananda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear Sáriputta vindicate himself (Vin.ii.236; A.iv.374). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahmá singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kokálika monk (Kokalika had a great hatred of them -  e.g., A.v.170ff.; SN., p. 231ff.; SNA.ii.473ff). When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gayásísa, the Buddha sent Sáriputta and Moggallána to bring them back. They were successful in this mission (DhA.i.143ff.; see also DhA.ii.109f., where they were sent to admonish the Assajipunabbasuká). Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggallána and later born in a huge manomayakáya, had warned Moggallána of Devadatta's intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggallána (Vin.ii.185; A.iii.122ff). When Ráhula, the Buddha's son, was ordained, Sáriputta was his preceptor and Moggallána his teacher (J.i.161; see SNA.i.304f., where the account is slightly different. There Moggallána is spoken of as Ráhula's kammavácáriya.). Moggallána seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks’ welfare. Among the verses, attributed to him in the Theragáthá, are several containing exhortations to his colleagues (Thag.vss.1146-9, 1165f ); some of the colleagues are mentioned by name -  e.g., Tissa, Vaddhamána and Potthila (Ibid., 1162, 1163, 1174f). Elsewhere (S.i.194f) mention is made of his living at Kálasilá, with a company of five </data>
<data>hundred monks, watching over them and discovering that all were arahants. Vangísa witnessed this and praised Moggallána in verse before the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The love existing between Moggallána and Sáriputta was mutual, as was the admiration. Sáriputta's verses in praise of Moggallána (Thag.vss.1178 81) are even more eloquent than those of Moggallána in praise of Sáriputta (Thag.vss.1176). Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye. E.g., S.ii.275ff.; Moggallána elsewhere also (S.ii.273f.) tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers. For another discussion between Sáriputta and Moggallána, see A.ii.154f. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahágosinga Sutta (M.i.212) we find them staying in the Gosingasálavana in the company of Mahá Kassapa, Ananda, Revata and Anuruddha, engaged in friendly discussion, referring their conclusions to the Buddha for his opinion. Sáriputta, Moggallána, and Anuruddha are again mentioned (S.v.174f., 299) as staying in the Ketakívana in Sáketa. Among discussions between Anuruddha and Moggallána is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of the value of cultivating the four satipatthánas (S.v.294f). It seems to have been usual for Sáriputta and Moggallána, in their journeys, to travel together at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were anxious to include them in their invitations. Velukandaki in Dakkhinagiri (A.iii.336; iv.63); and Cittagahapati in Macchikásanda (DhA.ii.74f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallána died before the Buddha, Sáriputta dying before either. The Theragáthá contains several verses attributed to Moggallána regarding Sáriputta's death (vs.1158 61). Sáriputta died on the full moon day of </data>
<data>Kattika and Moggallána two weeks later, on the new moon day (SA.iii.181).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentaries (J.v.125ff) his death resulted from a plot of the Niganthas. Moggallána used to visit various worlds and return with his report that he had discovered that those who followed the Buddha's teaching reached happy worlds, while the followers of the heretics were reborn in woeful conditions. These statements diminished the number of the heretics and they bribed brigands to kill Moggallána. They surrounded the Elder's cell in Kálasilá, but he, aware of their intentions, escaped through the keyhole. On six successive days this happened; on the seventh, they caught him and beat him, crushing his bones and leaving him for dead. Having recovered consciousness, with a great effort of will, he dragged himself to the Buddha in order to take his leave, and there he died, to the sorrow of the deva worlds. This sad death is said to have been the result of a sin committed by him in a previous birth. Acting on the instigation of his wife, he had taken his blind parents into a forest, where, pretending that they were attacked by thieves, he had beaten them to death. For this deed he suffered in hell for innumerable years, and in his last birth lost his life by violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account in DhA.iii.65ff. differs in several details. The thieves tried for two months before succeeding in their plot and, in the story of the past, when the blind parents were being beaten, they cried out to the supposed thieves to spare their son. Moggallána, very touched by this, did not kill them. Before passing into Nibbána, he preached to the Buddha, at his request, and performed many miracles, returning to Kálasilá to die. According to the Játaka account his cremation was performed with much honour, and the Buddha had the relics collected and a Thúpa erected in Veluvana.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Moggallána's body was of the colour of the blue lotus or the rain cloud (Bu.i.58). There exists in Ceylon an oral tradition that this colour is due to his having suffered in hell in the recent past!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallána is connected with characters in several Játakas: thus, he was &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Kisavaccha in the Indriya Játaka (J.iii.469),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sakka in the Illísa (i. 354), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;one of the devas in the Kakkáru (iii.90), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the tortoise in the Kurungamiga (ii.155), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Candasena in the Khandahála (vi. 157), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the senápati in the Cullasutasoma (v. 192),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the youngest bird in the Javanahamsa (iv. 218),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the elephant in the Tittira (i. 220), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the tiger in the Tittira (iii.543), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ayura in the Dasannaka (iii.341), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the jackal in the Pañcúposatha (iv. 332), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Suriya in the Bilárikosiya (iv. 69), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;one of the brothers in the Bhisa (iv. 314),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Subhaga in the Bhúridatta (vi. 219), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the old tortoise in the Maháukkusa (iv. 297),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Migájina in the Mahájanaka (vi. 68), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Bíjaka in the Mahánáradakassapa (vi. 255), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the king's charioteer in the Rájováda (ii.5),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the tiger in the Vannároha (iii.193), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Garula king in the Vidhurapandita (vi. 329),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the tiger in the Vyaggha (ii.358), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the rat in the Saccankara (i. 32), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Bhadrakára in the Sambhava (v. 67), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Kisavaccha in the Sambhanga (v. 151), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the jackal in the Sasa (iii.56), &lt;/li&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mahánáradakassapa Játaka (No. 544)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angati')"&gt;Angati&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mithilaa')"&gt;Mithilá&lt;/a&gt; in Videha, is a good ruler. One full moon night he consults his ministers as to how they shall amuse themselves. Aláta suggests new conquests; Sunáma suggests that they shall seek pleasure in dance, song and music; but Vijaya recommends that they shall visit some samana or brahmin. Angati falls in with the views of Vijaya, and in great state goes to Guna of the Kassapagotta, an ascetic who lives in the park near the city. Guna preaches to him that there is no fruit, good or evil, in the moral life; there is no other world than this, no strength, no courage; all beings are predestined and follow their course like the ship her stern. Aláta approves of the views of Guna; he remembers how, in his past life, he was a wicked councillor called Pingala; from there he was born in the family of a general, and now he is a minister. A slave, Bíjaka, who is present, can remember his past life and says he was once Bhavasetthi in Sáketa, virtuous and generous, but he is now the son of a prostitute. Even now he gives away half his food to any in need, but see how destitute he is!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angati is convinced that Ginda's doctrine is correct, and resolves to find delight only in pleasure. He gives orders that he shall not be disturbed in his palace; Candaka, his minister, is deputed to look after the kingdom. Fourteen days pass in this manner. Then the king's only child, his beloved daughter Rujá, comes to him arrayed in splendour, attended by her maidens, and asks for one thousand to be given the next day to mendicants. Angati protests; he will deny his daughter no pleasure or luxury, but has learnt too much to approve of her squandering money on charity or wasting her energy in </data>
<data>keeping the fasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rujá is at first amazed, then tells her father that his councillors are fools, they have not taken reckoning of the whole of their past, but remember only one birth or two; they cannot therefore judge. She herself remembers several births; in one she was a smith in Rájagaha and committed adultery, but that sin remained hidden, like fire covered with ashes, and she was born as a rich merchant's only son in Kosambí. There she engaged in good works, but, because of previous deeds, she was born after death in the Roruva-niraya and then as a castrated goat in Bhennákata. In her next birth she was a monkey, and then an ox among the Dasannas; then a hermaphrodite among the Vajjians, and later a nymph in Távatimsa. Once more her good deeds have come round, and hereafter she will be born only among gods and men. Seven births hence she will be a male god in Távatimsa, and even now the god Java is gathering a garland for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All night she preaches in this way to her father, but he remains unconvinced. The Bodhisatta is a Brahmá, named Nárada Kassapa, and, surveying the world, sees Rujá and Angati engaged in conversation. He therefore appears in the guise of an ascetic, and Angati goes out to greet and consult him. The ascetic praises goodness, charity, and generosity, and speaks of other worlds. Angati laughs, and asks for a loan which, he says, he will repay twice over in the next world, as the ascetic seems so convinced that there is one. Nárada tells him of the horrors of the hell in which Angati will be reborn unless he mends his ways, and mentions to him the names of former kings who attained to happiness through good lives. The king at last sees his error and determines to choose new friends. Nárada Kassapa reveals his identity and leaves in all majesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the conversion of </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa')"&gt;Uruvela Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;. He came, after his conversion, with the Buddha to Latthivana, and the people wondered if he had really become a follower of the Buddha. He dispelled their doubts by describing the folly of the sacrifices which he had earlier practised, and, laying his head on the Buddha's feet did obeisance. Then he rose seven times into the air, and, after having worshipped the Buddha, sat on one side. The people marvelled at the Buddha's powers of conversion, which, the Buddha said, were not surprising since he possessed them already as a Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angati is identified with Uruvela Kassapa, Aláta with Devadatta, Sunáma with Bhaddiya, Vijaya with Sáriputta, Bíjaka with Moggallána, Guna with the Licchavi Sunakkhatta, and Rujá with Ananda.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Díghanakha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Súkarakhatalena to Díghanakha, who tells the Buddha that no view can satisfy him. The Buddha points out to him the need for consistency in outlook and expounds to him his own doctrine. Sáriputta is present, fanning the Buddha. At the end of the discourse, Sáriputta becomes an arahant and Díghanakha a sotápanna (M.i.497ff). Elsewhere the sutta is called Vedanápariggaha.

The Bodhisatta appeared before him and threatened to crush his forces, and the Gandhára king fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to an ascetic who visited Jetavana in order to argue with the Buddha; but on seeing the Buddha seated in the hall expounding the Doctrine, his courage forsook him and he ran away with a crowd at his heels. He is identified with the Gandhára king. (J.ii.219-21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

According to the Commentaries (J.i.52; BuA.226; MA.ii.924, 1021, etc; ThigA.182) it was the city of the birth of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahamaayaa')"&gt;Buddha's mother&lt;/a&gt; and of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Pajápatí Gotamí&lt;/a&gt; and of their companions, who married the Sákiyans of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lumbini')"&gt;Lumbinívana&lt;/a&gt;, where the Buddha was born, was near Devadaha. The name was originally that of a lake, so called either because kings held their sports in it (devá vuccanti rájáno tesam mangaladaho), or because it came into existence without human intervention, hence divine (sayañjáto vá so daho, tasmá pi Devadaho). The name was later transferred to the village near by. SA.ii.186; also MA.ii.810. Acc. to the Dulva (Rockhill, p.12), the city was founded by Sákiyans from Kapilavatthu, when they grew very numerous. The spot was pointed out by a deva, hence its name.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; of Devadaha was a contemporary of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt; (p.14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadaha was the residence of Devadaha Sakka (Mhv.ii.17; MT.87) and of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pakkha_thera')"&gt;Pakkha Thera&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.114).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Mhv.ii.17; MT.87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devadaha Vagga&lt;/b&gt;.-The eleventh section of the Majjhima Nikáya (suttas 101-10), the Devadaha Sutta being its first sutta.

Devadaha Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Preached to the monks at Lumbinívana (MA.ii.810), in Devadaha. It deals with the teaching of the Niganthas, that whatsoever the individual experience, it comes from former actions. The sutta also gives ten beliefs of the Niganthas, which, the Buddha says, are to be condemned. In contrast to these, ten statements are made respecting the Tathágata, which are intrinsically true. M.ii.214ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devadaha Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Preached to the monks at Devadaha. Some monks, going to reside in the western districts, come to the Buddha to take leave of him. He advises them, before starting, to visit Sáriputta, whom he extols. This they do, and Sáriputta explains to them the fundamental teachings of the Buddha, in order that they may be ready to answer any questions which may be put to them. S.iii.6ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His wife had a longing to eat fresh fish, and while he was searching for it he saw two otters, Anutíracárí and Gambhíracárí, disputing as to the division of a rohita fish which they had caught between them. They appealed to Máyáví to arbitrate, and he gave one the head, the other the tail, while he kept the middle portion for himself!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Upananda, who is identified with the jackal. Two old monks had received as a gift two coarse cloaks and one fine blanket, and they appealed to him to divide the gifts. He gave them each a cloak and kept the blanket for himself.

He was at Kusinárá at the time of the Buddha's death, and it was his intervention which prevented a quarrel among the kings who assembled there to claim the Buddha's relics. He pointed out to them the impropriety of a quarrel over anything connected with the Buddha, the teacher of Peace. The claimants thereupon asked Dona to undertake the distribution of the relics. He divided them into eight parts, one of which he gave to each king. He himself kept the vessel used for collecting and dividing the relics, and over it he built a thúpa, celebrating a feast in its honour (D.ii.166f; Bu.xxviii.4; UdA.402).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dona first met the Buddha on the road between Ukkatthá and Setavyá. He saw the Buddha's footprints and, following them, he came upon the Buddha seated at the foot of a-tree. Dona asked him various questions as to his identity and the Buddha explained to him his Buddha-hood (A.ii.37f). The Commentary (AA.ii.505f) states that Dona was a teacher with a large following, and that the Buddha's journey to Setavyá was undertaken for the purpose of meeting him. At the end of the Buddha's discourse, Dona became an anágámí and composed a poem of twelve thousand words in praise of the Buddha. This poem became known as the Donagajjita. Dona was held in very high esteem as a teacher, and it is said (DA.ii.607f) that, at some time or other practically all the chiefs of Jambudípa had sat at his feet. Therefore he was able to dissuade them from quarrelling over the Buddha's relics. On that occasion he stood on a hill and recited the Donagajjita. At first his voice could not be heard through the uproar, but, by degrees, they recognised his voice and listened with wrapt attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the distribution of the relics, Dona, </data>
<data>watching his opportunity, hid, in his turban, the right eye-tooth of the Buddha, but Sakka saw this, and thinking that Dona was incapable of rendering suitable honour to this relic, removed it and placed it in the Cúlámani-cetiya (DA.ii.609).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Devá (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devá&lt;/b&gt;.-A class of beings. As a title the word Deva is attributed to any being regarded, in certain respects, as being above the human level. Thus it is used for a king. In a late classification (CNid.307; KhA.123, etc.) there are three kinds of Devil: sammutidevá (conventional gods - e.g., kings and princes); visuddhidevá (beings who are divine by the purity of their great religious merit - arahants and Buddhas); and uppattidevá (beings who are born divine). Under the third category various groups are enumerated, the commonest number being seven: Cátummahárájiká, Távatimsá, Yámá, Tusitá, Nimmánaratí, Paranimmitavasavattí and Brahmakáyiká (E.g., D.i.216; A.i.210, etc.). The longest list is that of the Majjhima Nikáya (i.289; iii.100. The Divyávadána p.266 contains a list of twenty-two), which contains the names of twenty-five groups. The popular etymology of the word connects it with the root div in the sense of playing, sporting, or amusing oneself, sometimes also of shining: dibbantí ti devá, pañcahi kámagunehi kílanti, attano vá siriyá jotantí ti attho (KhA.123). The word implies possession of splendour and power of moving at will, beauty, goodness and effulgence of body, and, as such, is opposed to the dark powers of mischief and destruction - such as the Asuras, Petas and Nerayikas. The Devas are generally regarded as sharing kinship and continuity of life with humans; all Devas have been men and may again be born among men. They take interest in the doings of men, especially the Cátummahárájiká and the gods of Távatimsa. They come to earth to worship the Buddha and to show reverence to good men. Sakka (q.v.) is usually spoken of as chief of the gods - devánam indo. All Devas are themselves in samsára, needing salvation. They are subject to death, their life-spans varying according to the </data>
<data>merit of each individual deva. They are born in the full flower of youth and are free from illness till the moment of their death. Devas die from one of the following causes: exhaustion of life, merit or food; failing, through forgetfulness, to eat; and jealousy at the glory of another, which leads to anger. (DhA.l.173. For other particulars regarding devas see the article in the NPD). When a deva is about to die five signs appear on him: his clothes get soiled, flowers worn by him fade, sweat exudes from his armpits, his body loses its colour and he becomes restless on his seat. DA.ii.427f; DhSA, 33, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devá.&lt;/b&gt;-Daughter of Udaya I. and wife of Mahinda, son of the Ádipáda Dáthásiva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cv.xlix.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

She built, for the monks living in the wilderness, a vihára called after herself, and adorned the Buddha-image at Maricavatti. Cv.lii.52, 61, 64ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devá or Vatapada Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The seven rules of conduct observed by Sakka, whereby he obtained celestial sovereignty. S.i.227.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Devadatta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of the Sákiyan Suppabuddha (maternal uncle of the Buddha) and his wife Amitá. He had a sister Bhaddakaccáná, who married Prince Siddhattha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mhv.ii.22; MT.136; DhA.iii.44. The   Dulva (Rockhill, p.13) calls him the son of Amitodana and brother of Ananda.   This is supported by Mtu. (ii.69), which says that after the Buddha's   renunciation, Devadatta tried to tempt Bhaddakaccáná. In one passage in the   Vinaya (ii.189), Devadatta is spoken of as Godhiputta. Does this mean that his   mother's name was Godhí? The Sanskrit books (e.g., Mtu) give several stories   of his youth which show his malice. When Siddhattha was about to show his   skill in the arts, a white elephant was being brought for him, and Devadatta,   out of envy, killed it. The carcase blocked the city gates till Siddhattha   threw it outside. The Páli Commentaries (e.g., SA.i.62) say that Devadatta had   the strength of five elephants. On another occasion he quarrelled with   Siddhattha, who protested against his shooting a goose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment and preached to the Sákiyans, Devadatta was converted together with his friends Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, and their barber, Upáli, and he sought the Buddha at Anupiyá and entered the Order (Vin.ii.182). During the rainy season that followed, Devadatta acquired the power of iddhi possible to those who are yet of the world (puthujja-nika-iddhi) (Vin.ii.183; for particulars see Rockhill, p.85). For some time he seems to have enjoyed great honour in the Order, and in one passage he is mentioned in a list of eleven of the chief Elders of all of whom the Buddha speaks in praise. (Ud.i.5. Again in Vin.ii.189 Sáriputta is mentioned as having gone about </data>
<data>Rájagaha singing Devadatta's praises; see also DhA.i.64f). Devadatta was later suspected of evil wishes (E.g., S.ii.156). About eight years before the Buddha's death, Devadatta, eager for gain and favour and jealous of the Buddha's fame, attempted to win over Ajátasattu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following account is summarised from various passages in the books, chiefly Vin.ii.184ff; iii.171f; 174f; iv.71; DhA.i.112ff; iii.154; A.iii.123, 402; ii.73; iv.160; J.i.113, 142, 185, 490; iv.37, 158; v.333ff; vi.129f., etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He assumed the form of a child having a girdle of snakes, and suddenly appeared on Ajátasattu's lap, frightening him. He then resumed his own form, and Ajátasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and sent him daily five hundred dishes of food. (According to J.i.186, 508, Ajátasattu built for him a monastery at Gayásísa and sent him, daily, five hundred pots of three-year-flavoured rice and the choicest dishes. These meals were so tempting that some of the Buddha's followers would go there to eat them and return stealthily). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This encouraged Devadatta in his schemes, and he conceived the idea of taking the Buddha's place as leader of the Sangha. As soon as this thought occurred to him, his iddhi-power disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Koliyan Kakudha, follower of Moggallána, reborn as a manomaya-káyikadeva, divined Devadatta's plan and informed Moggallána. The latter repeated the matter to the Buddha, but the Buddha said it was unnecessary to discuss it as Devadatta would ultimately betray himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime later, Devadatta went to the Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to him in view of the Buddha's approaching old age. The Buddha scorned the </data>
<data>suggestion, saying, &quot;Not even to Sáriputta or Moggallána would I hand over the Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?&quot; (Vin.ii.188. This incident is referred to in the Abhayarájakumára Sutta, M.i.393). Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance. Thereupon, at the Buddha's suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Sangha that in anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, none but Devadatta was to be recognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this time that Devadatta incited Ajátasattu to kill his father, Bimbisára, while he himself prepared to kill the Buddha. (The Ap.ii.300f explains that all these plans of Devadatta to harm the Buddha were the result of the Buddha's previous evil deeds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajátasattu agreed, and provided Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha. These were placed on different paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale. But when the Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha's majesty, and his body became stiff. The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing away his weapons, confessed his intended crime. The Buddha thereupon preached to him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path. The other groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after the other. The different groups were led to the Buddha by his iddhi-power, and he preached to them and converted them. The first man returned to Devadatta saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great iddhi-power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta then decided to kill the Buddha himself. One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhakúta, he hurled down on him a great rock. Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby </data>
<data>arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha's foot, causing the blood to flow. Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from there to Jívaka's Ambavana, where Jívaka attended him. After this event, the monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was impossible for anyone to deprive a Tathágata of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta's next attempt on the Buddha's life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalágiri (or Dhanapála), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass. The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back. As the elephant advanced he pervaded it with love, and thus completely subdued it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This outrage made Devadatta very unpopular, and even Ajátasattu was compelled by the force of public opinion to withdraw his patronage from Devadatta, whose gain and honour decreased. (Sp.iv.811. At this time, Kokálika was very useful to Devadatta, J. ii.438). Thereupon he decided, with the help of several others, Kokálika, Katamoraka-tissa, Khandadeviyáputta and Samuddadatta, to bring about a schism in the Order. These five went accordingly to the Buddha and asked for the imposition of five rules on all members of the Sangha: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(1) that monks should dwell all their   lives in the forest, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(2) that they should accept no   invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging,   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(3) that they should wear only robes   made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(4) that they should dwell at the foot   of a tree and not under a roof, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(5) that they should abstain </data>
<data>  completely from fish and flesh. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha's reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules - except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season - but he refused to make the rules obligatory. This refusal delighted Devadatta, who went about with his party, declaring that the Buddha was prone to luxury and abundance. He was believed by the foolish, and in spite of the Buddha's warning against the dire sin of causing schism in the Order, Devadatta informed Amanda of his intention of holding an uposatha meeting without the Buddha, and, having persuaded five hundred newly ordained monks from Vesáli to join him, he went out to Gayásísa. On this occasion he tried to imitate the Buddha, keeping two chief disciples beside him (DhA.i.122). Three suttas, the two Devadatta, and the Mahásáropama, were preached after this event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the followers of Devadatta were also some nuns, chief of whom was Thullanandá, who never tired of singing his praises (Vin.iv.66, 335). The mother of Kumárakassapa (q.v.), also, first entered the Order under Devadatta, but when he denounced her, following the discovery of her pregnancy, she sought refuge with the Buddha. Some of the Sákiyans, too, seem to have preferred Devadatta to the Buddha - e.g., Dandapáni (MA.i.298). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha sent Sáriputta and Moggallána to Gayásísa to bring back the deluded ones. Devadatta, believing that they had come to join him, rejoiced, and, in spite of Kokálika's warning, welcomed them. That night he preached very late to the monks, and, wishing for rest, asked Sáriputta to address the assembly. Sáriputta and Moggallána preached to such effect that they persuaded the five hundred monks to return with them. Kokálika kicked Devadatta on the chest to awaken him and tell him the news. When </data>
<data>Devadatta discovered what had happened, hot blood came from his mouth, and for nine months he lay grievously ill. (The Vinaya account omits the kicking, but it is mentioned in DhA.i.143 and in J.i.491). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his end drew near, he wished to see the Buddha, though the latter had declared that it would not be possible in this life. Devadatta, however, started the journey on a litter, but on reaching Jetavana, he stopped the litter on the banks of the pond and stepped out to wash. The earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avíci, where, after suffering for one hundred thousand kappas, he would be reborn as a Pacceka Buddha called Atthissara. (The Saddharmapundarika (chap.xi.) says he will be a Buddha named Devarája). It is said (DhA.i.147; see also Mil.108) that at the moment of being swallowed by the earth, Devadatta uttered a stanza in which he declared that he had no refuge other than the Buddha. It is this last act of Devadatta's which the Buddha had in view when he agreed to ordain Devadatta. (He was one of five people who were swallowed by the earth in the Buddha's time. Mil.101). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary contains a graphic account of the tortures of Devadatta in Avíci. (DhA.i.147; also PSA.79. His body in bell is one hundred leagues long). In previous births, also, he had been swallowed by the earth, as King Kalábu and as Mahápatápa. When the people heard of Devadatta's death, they held a great festival, as they had done of yore at the death of Pingala, who was an incarnation of Devadatta (DhA.i.126f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka Commentary contains numerous stories showing that Devadatta's enmity towards the Buddha was not confined to this life. It had existed during many kappas, and though sometimes he was foiled in his attempts to harm the Bodhisatta, in many cases he succeeded in working </data>
<data>his will. The beginning of this enmity, which increased with time, is described in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/serivanija_jat_003')"&gt;Serivánija Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Milinda dilemmas (200ff) is as follows: &quot;Why should Devadatta, who was so wicked, have been, time after time, superior in power to the Bodhisatta?&quot; A list of such instances is given. Nágasena's reply is that Devadatta did several good deeds, such as protecting the poor, building bridges, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta's wickedness and his hatred of the Bodhisatta are illustrated in various Játakas besides those already mentioned - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kakkara_jat_209')"&gt;the Kakkara,  &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapi_jat_250_404')"&gt;the Kapi,  &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kukkura_jat_22')"&gt;the Kukkura,  &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the Kurunga, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurungamiga_jat_21_206')"&gt;the Kurunga-miga, &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khandahaala_jat_542')"&gt;the Khandahála, &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/godha_jat_138_141_325_333')"&gt;the Godha, &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campeyya_jat_506')"&gt;the Campeyya,  &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_nandiya_jat_222')"&gt;the Cúla-Nandiya, &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chaddanta_jat_514')"&gt;the Chaddanta,  &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tacchasuukara_jat_492')"&gt;the Tacchasúkara, &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tayodhamma_jat_58')"&gt;the Tayodhamma,</data>

On the death of his queen he took another queen and had by her a son, Bharata. When Bharata was seven years old his mother claimed the kingdom for him in accordance with a boon granted her by the king. The king was horrified and fearing that she would harm his elder children, sent them into the forest for twelve years, asking them to return after his death. In the forest Ráma lived the ascetic life while Lakkhana and Sítá provided him with food. Dasaratha died after nine years, and when the ministers refused to recognise Bharata as king, he went into the forest in search of Ráma. Ráma, however, refused to return until three more years had elapsed, and on Bharata refusing to occupy the throne, Ráma gave him his straw slippers to be placed on the throne in his absence. When cases were heard, if the decision given was wrong, the slippers would beat upon each other, but, if right, they would lie quiet. After three years Ráma returned and reigned from his palace of Sucandaka for sixteen thousand years, with Sítá as queen consort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dasaratha was Suddhodana, Bharata Ananda, Lakkhana Sáriputta, Sítá Ráhulamátá and Ráma the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a man of Sávatthi who greatly grieved at his father's death and neglected all his duties.

Among his sons was Mánavamma, and it was with his help that he became King Dappula I. on the death of Kassapa II. But he reigned in Anurádhapura for only seven days, after which Hatthadátha (Dáthopatissa II.) captured the throne. Dappula thereupon retired to Rohana and ruled as king there for three years (650-3 A.C.). His wife was the daughter of Siládátha (Silámeghavanna) (Cv.xlv, 16-22, 36ff, 51ff). Dappula was a very pious follower of the Buddha and erected many viháras, repaired others, and made an image of Metteyya, fifteen cubits high. (For details of his doings see Cv.xli.53ff). He died from grief at the death of his son Mánavamma, who was killed by Hatthadátha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dappula.-Nephew of Aggabodhi VI. When Mahinda II. succeeded Aggabodhi VII. Dappula rose against him, but, in spite of several attempts, failed to overcome him. He thereupon retired to Rohana where he ruled, having formed a treaty with Mahinda. Some time later, he made another attempt to win the throne and fought to fierce battle at Maháummára, where he was defeated and forced to flee (CV.xlviii.90, 98, 109, 122, 125, 131, 155f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dappula.-Younger brother of Aggabodhi VIII., whom he succeeded to the throne as Dappula II, (812 - 28 A.C.). He had a senápati called Vajira and a daughter named Devá. His sister was married to Mahinda, ruler of Rohana, and Dappula adopted Mahinda's sons when they were driven away by their father. Dappula rebuilt the Hatthikucchi°, Váhadípa° and Lávarávapabbata-viháras, and enlarged the Mahápáli Hall, in addition to various other acts of piety. Cv.xlix.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.

<data>and brother of Kittaggabodhi (Cv.xlix.72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Dappula.-Yuvarájá of Kassapa V., and afterwards his successor as Dappula III. He reigned for only seven months (in 923 A.C.) (Cv.lii.42; liii.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Dappula.-Yuvarájá of Dappula III. and afterwards king, Dappula IV. (923-34 A.C.). During his reign the Pandu king came to Ceylon to seek his help against the Colas. Dappula was willing to help him but was opposed by his mother. Dappula's commander was Rakkhaka Ilanga, who built a dwelling called after the king. Cv.liii.4-12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sumedha) and  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his mother Sumedhá.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ten thousand years he lived in the household, in three palaces, Hamsá, Koñcá and Mayúrá.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife was Padumá and his son Usabhakkhandha (Samavatakkhandha).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left home on an elephant and practised austerities for ten months.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Bodhi-tree was the Pipphalí and grass for his seat was given by an Ájívaka named Sunanda.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first sermon was preached at Nandáráma (Sunandáráma) at Sirighara, where he converted the heretics.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had three great gatherings of his followers.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was always attended by eighty-four thousand arahants, and his body was eighty cubits in height.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died at Nandáráma at the age of one hundred thousand years and his thúpa was thirty-six yojanas high.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumangala and Tissa were his chief monks,  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nandá and Sunandá his chief nuns, while  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ságata (v.l. Nanda) was his constant attendant.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapassu and Bhallika were his chief lay patrons among men and Sirimá and Soná among women.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;It was during the time of Dípankara Buddha that the ascetic &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumedha')"&gt;Sumedha&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.), who later became &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, first declared his intention of becoming an aspirant for Enlightenment (a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Dípankara's death, his doctrine lasted for one hundred thousand years.

Kálavilangika's wife, disguised as a man, taking food from the palace to an impaled man, passed under his tree and was seized as his prey. But on learning that she was the king's messenger, the yakkha released her and asked her to convey the news that Díghataphala's wife Kálí, daughter of the god Sumana, had given birth to a son. In return for this service, Díghataphala gave the messenger the treasure buried under the tree. She went about shouting the news, and Sumana, hearing it, gave her more treasure.

Dhammaguttá, Dhammaguttiká.-A secondary division of the Mahimsásakas (Dpv.v.47; Mhv.v.8; Mbv., p.96), probably an offshoot of the Sabbatthivádins. They had a special Vinaya of their own. According to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, pp.185, 192), they were called after their leader, Dharmagupta. Their fundamental doctrines were these: that the Buddha is not comprised in the Sangha; that while there is great reward for offerings made to the Buddha, there is none for offerings to the Sangha; that a life of brahmacariya exists also among the devas; and that there are worldly laws as opposed to spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammaguttá.-A Vemanika-peta, mentioned as having the power of travelling through the air. Vsm.382.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dona Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin, Dona (probably identical with Dona 1 above), visits the Buddha and asks if it be true that the Buddha does not honour brahmins. The Buddha tells him that there are five kinds of brahmins - the Brahma-like, the deva-like, the bound, the breaker of bonds, and the brahmin-outcast - and, at Dona's request, describes these in detail (A.iii.223ff). The classification of brahmins given in this sutta is often referred to. E.g., SNA.i.318, 325, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She complained to the king and, at his request, she set the mark on her hand with vermillion on his back. By day the man was an ascetic, and when he found that he was discovered he fled through the air. The king thereupon suspected all ascetics and ordered them all to leave the kingdom. The king became a heretic. The Bodhisatta who was born as Sakka, seeing all this, came to Benares with an old Pacceka Buddha and stood close to the palace, showing him great reverence. When the king came out Sakka revealed his identity, telling him that even the ruler of the gods honoured pious men. The king saw his error and mended his ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the story is given in the Mahákanha Játaka. The king is identified with Ananda. J.iii.303-7. More or less the same story is given at greater length and with several variations in detail in both the Cullahamsa and the Maháhamsa Játakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He reigned for five hundred years and, at the end of that period, gave alms to the brahmins, renounced his kingdom and became an ascetic (J.vi.203).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Dudípa, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, who is mentioned (J.vi.99) as having given away great wealth, and as a result reached heaven. v.l.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dhúmarakkha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountain in Ceylon, not far from Kacchakatittha, no the right bank of the Maháválukanadí. There Pandukábhaya defeated his uncles and occupied their fortified camp for two years. The mountain was the abode of yakkhas, and it was here that Pandukábhaya captured the Yakkhiní Cetiyá, near the pond Tumbariyangana in the vicinity of the mountain (Mhv.x.46, 53, 58ff). King Mahánáma built a vihára there (Cv.xxxvii.213).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahávamsa Tíká (p.289), the mountain was also called Udumabarapabbata (or -giri). There seems (See P.L.C., s.v. Udumbaragiri) to have lived at Udumbaragiri a fraternity of forest-dwelling monks who produced from among their number several scholars of great repute and monks of great piety - e.g., Kassapa and Medhankara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mountain is identified (Ep. Zey.ii.194ff) with the present &quot;Gunners' Quoin&quot; on the right bank of the Mahávaliganga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A.iii.340.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dárukkhandha Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-The Buddha, while staying at Kosambí, sees a great log of wood floating down the river, and tells the monks that just as the log, if it does not ground on a bank, or sink in midstream, or stick on a shoal, or fall into human or non-human hands, or get caught in a whirlpool, or rot inwardly, will, without doubt, float down to the ocean; so will a monk, without doubt, float down to Nibbána if he escapes the dangers on the way. The monks ask what the dangers are, and the Buddha explains them, on the analogy of the dangers besetting the log. At the end of the discourse, the cowherd Nanda, who had been listening, joined the Order. S.iv.179f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

Devala.&lt;/b&gt;-An ascetic who once came from the region of Himavá in search of vinegar and honey and took refuge for the night in a potter's house. Another ascetic, Nárada (the Bodhisatta), arrived later at the hut and, with the permission of Devala, stayed there. During the night, Nárada, going out of the hut, trod on the locks of Devala who lay right across the doorway. He asked for pardon, and returning, passed by what he took to be Devala's feet, but Devala had turned round and Nárada again trod on his hair. Devala thereupon cursed him, saying that, at sunrise, his head would split in seven pieces; but Nárada stopped the sun from rising. The king enquired as to what had happened, and, on learning the story, forced Devala to ask Nárada's pardon. As he did not do this of his own free will, he was taken, at Nárada's suggestion, to a pond and made to stand up to his neck in water with a lump of clay on his head. As soon as the sun rose the lump of clay split in seven pieces and Devala swam away. Devala is identified with Thulla-Tissa. DhA.i.32ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Bu.xi.24; BuA.159; Ap.i.106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Devala.&lt;/b&gt;-An ascetic in Himavá. He lived before the time of Padumuttara Buddha, who was yet in Tusita, but realizing in his mind the qualities of previous Buddhas, Devala built a cetiya on the bank of a river and made offerings to it in the name of the Buddha. Later, he was born in the Brahma-world. He was a previous birth of Sirimatthera </data>

When Upáli was once born as Sunanda, the king's son, one day, when riding on an elephant, he saw Devala and insulted him. It was for this reason that he was born in a low caste in his last life.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dutthatthaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third Sutta of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipáta (SN.vs.780-87). The sutta was preached in reference to the calumny raised against the Buddha by the heretics who used the female ascetic Sundarí to further their ends (SNA.ii.518f). Commentarial explanation of this is included in the Mahániddesa (i.62ff). The burden of the sutta is that he who praises his own virtue and is dependent upon varying dogmas of philosophy is constantly censured. The muni is one who has shaken off all systems of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was born in the Sarana pleasance in the city of Sarana, his father being a khattiya named Sarana, and his mother Sunandá. It is said that on the day of his birth all unjust laws disappeared from the law-books, hence his name. For eight thousand years he lived in the household, in three palaces - Araja, Viraja and Sudassana. His chief wife was Vicitolí and his son Puññavaddhana. He left the world travelling in his palace, accompanied by all his retinue. For seven days he practised austerities; his wife gave him a meal of milk-rice, and a yavapálaka, named Sirivaddha, gave grass for his seat; his bodhi-tree was a bimbijála-tree. His first sermon was preached at Isipatana. Later he preached to King Sañjaya of Tagara, and to Sakka, who was the Bodhisatta. The Buddha's half-brothers, Paduma and Phussadeva, became his chief disciples, and Hárita was chief of those who practised the dhutangas. The Buddha's personal attendant was Sunetta, his chief women disciples being Khemá and Sabba-(Sacca)-dinná. Subhadda and Katisaha were the chief among men of his lay patrons, and Sáliyá and Valiyá among women. The Buddha's body was eighty cubits high and he lived to be one hundred thousand years old, dying at the Kesáráma in Sálavati. Bu.xvi.1ff; BuA.182ff; J.i.38, 39, 40, 44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammadassí.-A monk of Pagan, author of the Páli grammar, Vaccavácaka. Bode. op. cit., p.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dakkhinápatha (Dakkhinápatha)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the old Páli literature the name Dakkhinápatha would seem to indicate only a remote settlement or colony on the banks of the upper Godávarí. Thus, we are told that Bávarí had his hermitage in Dakkhinápatha territory, midway between the kingdoms of Assaka and Alaka (SN., vs.976). Elsewhere the name is coupled with Avanti as Avantidakkhinápatha and seems to refer, but more vaguely, to the same limited district. Vin.i.195, 196; ii.298. In J.v.133, however, Avanti is spoken of as a part of Dakkhinápatha (Dakkhinúpathe Avantirattha), but see J.iii.463, where Avantidakkhinápatha is spoken of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta Nipáta Commentary (ii.580) seems to explain Dakkhinápatha as the road leading to the &lt;b&gt;Dakkhinajanapada&lt;/b&gt;, while the Sumangala-Vilásiní (DA.i.265) takes Dakkhinápatha to be synonymous with Dakkhinajanapada and says that it was the district (janapada) south of the Ganges (Gangáya dakkhinato pákatajanapadam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that, in the earlier literature at any rate, the word did not mean the whole country comprised in the modern word Dekkhan. It is possible that Dakkhinápatha was originally the name of the road which led southwards - the Aryan settlement at the end of the road, on the banks of the Godávarí being also called by the same name - and that later the road lent its name to the whole region through which it passed. (For a detailed description see Law: Geog. of Early Buddhism, pp.60ff). In the Petavatthu Commentary (PvA., p.133) the Damila country (Damilavisaya) is included in the Dakkhinápatha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dakkhinápatha is famous in literature as the birthplace of strong bullocks (DhSA.141; NidA.16; DhA.iii.248, etc.). It held also a large number of ascetics (DA.i.265), and in the &quot;southern districts&quot; (Dakkhinesu </data>
<data>janapadesu) people celebrated a feast called Dharana (A.v.216). See Dharana Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

To be able to do this, they must practise the doctrine which they preach, and the method of such practice is the Ariyan Eightfold Path. S.iv.252; cp.261f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dhanuggaha-Tissa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Elder. One night, while staying with his friend Utta (Datta?) in a monastery in Kosala, he awoke and, lighting a fire, started talking to him. Their conversation turned on the war which Pasenadi was waging against Ajátasattu. Tissa, maintaining that Pasenadi was ignorant of the arts of war, proceeded to describe in detail what Pasenadi should do if he wished for victory. Some courtiers, overhearing the conversation, reported it to Pasenadi, who, profiting by it, re-entered the battle and captured Ajátasattu alive. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he related the Vaddhaki-súkara Játaka (q.v.) to show that in the past, too, Tissa had been skilled in the art of warfare (J.ii.403f). The Tacchasúkara Játaka (J.iv.343, 354) was also related in this connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Dakkhinagiri)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A janapada (district) in India, the capital of which was Ujjeni, and over which Asoka ruled as Viceroy. It also contained the city of Vedisá (Sp.i.70; Mhv.xiii.5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dakkhinágiri lay to the south of Rájagaha, beyond the hills that surrounded the city - hence its name (SNA.i.136; MA.ii.795; SA.i.188). In the district was the brahmin village of Ekanálá (SN., p.13). The road from Sávatthi to Rájagaha lay through Dakkhinágiri, and the Buddha traversed it in the course of his periodical tours through Magadha, residing in the Dakkhinágiri-vihára in Ekanálá (S.i.172; SA.ii.133; Vin.i.80). It was during one of these tours that he converted Kasí-Bháradvája and Dhammasava (q.v.) and his father. On another of these occasions the Buddha saw the Magadhakhetta, which gave him the idea of designing the robe of a monk to resemble a field (Vin.i.287). Ananda is also said to have travelled through Dakkhinágiri, gathering a large number of young men into the Order, who, however, do not appear to have been very serious in their intentions, as their behaviour earned for Ananda the censure of Mahá Kassapa (S.ii.217f). Later, we find Punna with a large following in Dakkhinágiri refusing to join in the findings of the Rájagaha Council, and preferring to follow the Dhamma according to his own lights (Vin.ii.289).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dakkhinágiri was the residence of Nandamátá of Velukantaka and she was visited both by Sáriputta and by Moggallána during a tour in the district (A.iv.64). In Dakkhinágiri, Sáriputta heard of the lack of zeal of Dhánañjáni (M.ii.185; see J.i.224 for another incident connected with Sáriputta's tour). The Arámadúsa Játaka (q.v.) was preached in Dakkhinágiri.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The Dakkhinágiri-vihára was, for a long time, a great monastic centre, and at the foundation of the Mahá Thúpa there were present from there forty thousand monks led by Mahá Sangharakkhita.

Dakkhinágiri-vihára&lt;/b&gt;.-A monastery built by Saddhátissa in Ceylon (Mhv.xxxiii.7). It was restored by Dhátusena (Cv.xxxviii.46), and Kassapa V. granted a village for its maintenance (Cv.lii.60). It is probably identical with the Dakkhinágiridalha-vihára, in which Aggabodhi I. erected an assembly-hall (Cv.xlii.27). It has sometimes been identified with the present Mulkirigala-vihára (Cv.Trs.i.33, n.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once the residence of Appihá-Sámanera (MT.552) and of Kála Buddharakkhita (MA.i.469).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Pasenadi hints that the Buddha is young and, as compared with other teachers, not fully enlightened. The Buddha explains to him that there are four things in the world which must not be lightly regarded on account of their youth - a noble prince, a snake, a fire, and a holy man (bhikkhu). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was this sutta which effected the conversion of Pasenadi.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Donapáka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Pasenadi, uncomfortable and short of breath after a heavy meal, visited the Buddha. The Buddha admonished him on the evils of gluttony and taught the young Sudassana, who came with Pasenadi, a verse to be repeated whenever food was placed before the king. The king paid the young man one hundred kahápanas daily for this service. Pasenadi profited by the lesson and became healthy. S.i.81; DhA.iii.264f gives a fuller version of this story. There Sudassana is described as the king's nephew. This is also probably the incident mentioned at DhA.iv.15f; but the youth there is called Uttara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The eldest died and was born as Sakka; he visited the others, and gave them, respectively, a magic razor-axe, which could be used as razor or axe; a drum, one side of which drove away elephants, while the other made friends of them; and a bowl from which a stream of curd flowed at its possessor's will. In a beautiful island far away lived a wild boar who owned a gem which enabled its possessor to travel through the air. A shipwrecked sailor from Kási stole this while the boar slept, and, with it, travelled to the Himálaya. There he saw the ascetics, and, in exchange for the gem, obtained from them their magic possessions, afterwards returning and killing them, so that he regained the gem. He then went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and took possession of the throne, becoming known as King Dadhiváhana, because he destroyed his enemies by drowning them in a river of curds. In his garden grew a mango tree, sprung from a mango which had floated down from Lake Kannamunda. He sent fruits from this tree as presents to the neighbouring kings, but always pricked the mango stone with a thorn so that it should not bear fruit. Once, an offended king sent to Dadhiváhana a gardener whom he had bribed to destroy the flavour of the mangoes. The king gave him employment, but the gardener, by growing bitter creepers round the mango tree, destroyed the flavour of the fruit. The Bodhisatta, who was the king's councillor, discovered the plot and had the creepers uprooted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to illustrate the effects of evil association (J.ii.101-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Duttha.&lt;/b&gt;-Also called &lt;b&gt;Dutthakumára&lt;/b&gt;, the son of Kitavása. At his birth soothsayers foretold his death from thirst, and Kitavása had lakes and ponds dug in various parts of the capital and waterpots placed everywhere. One day Duttha saw a Pacceka Buddha begging for alms and dashed his bowl to the ground. He was seized with thirst, and all the water in the city was dried up. He died, and was reborn in Avíci.

One day the teacher, in a drunken fit of boasting, announced that he would do the dance of the five javelins - which he did not know - and insisted on doing it against the advice of the Bodhisatta. The result was that the boaster was impaled on the fifth javelin (J.i.430f). For the introductory story see the Gijjha Játaka (No.42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dhammadinna &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dhammadinna Thera.-Also called Mahádhammadinna. An arahant. He resided at Talanga-(Talangatissa-pabbata) (q.v.). He was one of the monks who partook of the meal of sour gruel given by Dutthagámaní when in dire distress for want of food. Dhammadinna distributed his share among ten thousand monks in Piyangudípa (Mhv.xxxii.52). He is also mentioned (MT.606) as having accepted a meal given by Sáliya and his wife when they were blacksmiths in a previous birth. Dhammadinna had a nephew who became an arahant in the tonsure-hall. Dhammadinna read to him the three Pitakas, and he learnt them all on that occasion (VibhA.389). Dhammadinna's teacher was Mahánága of Uccatalanka (v.l. Uccaválika). Dhammadinna visited him in his old age, knowing that, though he himself thought he had attained arahantship, this was not the case. By a display of iddhi-power, Dhammadinna convinced Mahánága of his error and gave him a subject of meditation. Almost immediately after, the Elder became an arahant (VibhA.489; Vsm.634f). Once, while preaching the Apannaka Sutta, at Tissamaháráma, Dhammadinna pointed his fan downwards, whereupon the earth opened to the depth of Avíci, revealing all that was there. Similarly, he showed all things to the height of the Brahma-world. During his sermon he frightened the audience with the fear of hell and lured them with the bliss of heaven (Vsm.392).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhima Commentary records that soon after the ordination of Dhammadinna many monks, on his advice, became arahants. (MA.i.149ff. A variation of what is evidently the same story is found in AA.i.25). Hearing of this, the monks of Tissamaháráma sent a number of their colleagues to fetch him. He preached to them, and they attained arahantship and remained with him. Three times this happened. On the fourth occasion an aged </data>
<data>monk was sent. He gave the message of the monks and Dhammadinna started at once to go to them. On the way, at Hankana (v.l. Tangana) and at Cittalapabbata, he persuaded two monks, who thought they were arahants, to display their iddhi-power, and, thereby convinced them of their error; thereupon he gave them topics of meditation. On his arrival at Tissamaháráma, the monks failed to pay him their respects. He thereupon made the earth tremble and returned to his own vihára. The Saddhammasangaha (p.88f) relates the story of a blind rat-snake who heard Dhammadinna recite the satipatthánas and was later born as Tissámacca, minister of Dutthagámani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammadinna.-An eminent lay-follower of the Buddha. He once came with five hundred upásakas to the Buddha at Isipatana and asked him to give them a lesson which might profit them, for, said he, it is difficult for a householder encumbered with a family and the luxuries of household life to comprehend the Buddha's teachings in their fullness. The Buddha answers that they should practise the four limbs of sotápatti: loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and the cultivation of Áriyan virtues. Dhammadinna answers that they already possess these limbs. The Buddha then expresses his great satisfaction (S.v.406ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.iii.223) says that Dhammadinna was one of seven laymen with followings of five hundred - the others being Visákha, Ugga, Citta, Hatthaka Álavaka and Cúla- and Mahá-Anáthapindika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dhammadinna. A monk of Tissamahá-vihára near Talañgarapabbata. Once, while on pilgrimage to Nágadípa with 500 others, he stopped at Ságiri Vihára, and they were looked after by Bahulamassutissa Thera. The next day they went for alms to Punnsálakotthaka, where a resident entertained them to a meal with hare's flesh. Dhammadinna later asked why Tissa </data>
<data>Thera did not admonish his follower on the evils of killing, seeing that there was a heap of bones outside the house. Tissa asked Dhammadinna to do so the next day. This was done; the devotee confessed that he had never killed a hare, but in his house there was never any want of hare's flesh, and he did not know why. Dhammadinna, with his divine eye, revealed to him that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had given alms with hare's flesh. Ras.ii.128f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>
