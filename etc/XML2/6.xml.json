The spot was consecrated by the Buddha having sat there in meditation (Mhv.i.82) and also by former Buddhas doing likewise (Mhv.xv.86). The th\u00fapa there was the first of its kind in Ceylon and enshrined the Buddha's collar-bone. Miracles, said to have been ordained by the Buddha himself, attended its enshrinement (Mhv.xvii.30, 50). The monastery was built later than the th\u00fapa, hence its name (Mhv.xvii.62). One of the eight saplings of the Bodhi-tree at Anur\u00e1dhapura was planted in the grounds and exists to this day (Mhv.xix.61). The Cittas\u00e1l\u00e1 was to the east of the Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma, and on that site Sanghamitt\u00e1 was cremated (Mhv.xx.52).

Amandag\u00e1mani added an inner verandah to the uposatha-hall in the monastery (Mhv.xxxv.3), while Vasabha placed lamps round the th\u00fapa and built a new uposatha-house (Mhv.xxxv.80, 87, 91). Bh\u00e1tika-Tissa erected another assembly-hall, while Goth\u00e1bhaya made certain restorations (Mhv.xxxvi.4, 106).

D\u00e1thopatissa II. gave the village of Punnali to the Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma (Mhv.xlv.28), and M\u00e1navamma built a p\u00e1s\u00e1da (Mhv.xlvii.66). Aggabodhi VII. repaired the doors and transposed the pillars of the structure round the cetiya (Cv.xlviii.65). Mahinda II. placed a casing of gold and silver plates in the cetiya (Cv.xlviii.140), while Dappula II. covered the th\u00fapaghara with golden bricks (Cv.xlix.81); both plates and bricks were later plundered by the Pandu king (Cv.l.35). The golden plates were restored by Udaya II. (Cv.li.128), and Sena Ilanga provided a building for the monks to the west of the Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma (Cv.lii.16). Rakkha Ilanga did likewise (Cv.liii.11). Mahinda IV. covered the cetiya with strips of gold and silver, provided a golden door for the vih\u00e1ra and instituted a great festival (Cv.liv.42f).

The whole kingdom was ten thousand leagues in extent (DhA.i.273), and contained more than one thousand p\u00e1s\u00e1das (J.vi.279). The chief features of T\u00e1vatimsa were its parks - the Ph\u00e1rusaka, Cittalat\u00e1, Missaka and Nandana - the Vejayantap\u00e1s\u00e1da, the P\u00e1ricchatta tree, the elephant-king Er\u00e1vana and the Assembly-hall Sudhamm\u00e1 (J.vi.278; MA.i.183; cp.

Eighty crores of devas attained to a knowledge of the truth. This was in the seventh year after his Enlightenment (J.iv.265; DhA.iii.216f; BuA. p.3). It seems to have been the frequent custom of ascetics, possessed of iddhi-power, to spend the afternoon in T\u00e1vatimsa (E.g., N\u00e1rada, J.vi.392; and K\u00e1ladevala, J.i.54).</p><p><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')\">Moggall\u00e1na</a> paid numerous visits to T\u00e1vatimsa, where he learnt from those dwelling there stories of their past deeds, that he might repeat them to men on earth for their edification (VvA. p.4).</p><p>The J\u00e1taka Commentary mentions several human beings who were invited by Sakka, and who were conveyed to T\u00e1vatimsa - e.g. Nimi, Guttila, Mandh\u00e1t\u00e1 and the queen S\u00edlavat\u00ed. Mandh\u00e1t\u00e1 reigned as co-ruler of T\u00e1vatimsa during the life period of thirty-six Sakkas, sixty thousand years (J.ii.312).

(See", "<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/sudhammaa')\">Sudhamm\u00e1</a> for details). A description of such an assembly is found in the Janavasabha Sutta. The C\u00e1tummah\u00e1r\u00e1jika Devas (q.v.) are present to act as guards. Inhabitants of other deva- and brahma-worlds seemed sometimes to have been present as guests - e.g. the Brahm\u00e1 Sanankum\u00e1ra, who came in the guise of Pa\u00f1casikha. From the description given in the sutta, all the inhabitants of T\u00e1vatimsa seem to have been followers of the Buddha, deeply devoted to his teachings (D.ii.207ff). Their chief place of offering was the C\u00fal\u00e1manicetiya, in which Sakka deposited the hair of Prince Siddhattha, cut off by him when he renounced the world and put on the garments of a recluse on the banks of the Nera\u00f1jar\u00e1 (J.i.65). Later, Sakka deposited here also the eye-tooth of the Buddha, which Doha hid in his turban, hoping to keep it for himself (DA.ii.609; Bu.xxviii.6, 10).</p><p>The gods of T\u00e1vatimsa sometimes come to earth to take part in human festivities (J.iii.87). Thus Sakka, Vissakamma and M\u00e1tali are mentioned as having visited the earth on various occasions. Mention is also made of goddesses from T\u00e1vatimsa coming to bathe in the Anotatta and then spending the rest of the day on the Manosil\u00e1tala (J.v.392).</p><p>The capital city of T\u00e1vatimsa was Masakkas\u00e1ra (Ibid., p.400). The average age of an inhabitant of T\u00e1vatimsa is thirty million years, reckoned by human computation. Each day in T\u00e1vatimsa is equal in time to one hundred years on earth (DhA.i.364). The gods of T\u00e1vatimsa are most handsome; the Licchavis, among earth-dwellers, are compared to them (DhA.iii.280). The stature of some of the T\u00e1vatimsa dwellers is three-quarters of a league; their undergarment is a robe of twelve leagues and their upper garment also a robe of twelve leagues. They live in mansions of gold, thirty leagues in extent (Ibid., p.8). The Commentaries (E.g., SA.i.23; AA.i.377) say", "that T\u00e1vatimsa was named after Magha and his thirty-two companions, who were born there as a result of their good deeds in Macalag\u00e1ma. Whether the number of the chief inhabitants of this world always remained at thirty-three, it is impossible to say, though some passages, e.g. in the Janavasabha Sutta, lead us to suppose so.</p><p>Sometimes, as in the case of Nandiya, who built the great monastery at Isipatana, a mansion would appear in T\u00e1vatimsa, when an earth-dweller did a good deed capable of obtaining for him birth in this deva-world; but this mansion would remain unoccupied till his human life came to an end (DhA.iii.291). There were evidently no female devas among the Thirty-three. Both M\u00e1y\u00e1 and Gopik\u00e1 (q.v.) became devaputtas when born in T\u00e1vatimsa. The women there were probably the attendants of the devas. (But see, e.g., J\u00e1lini and the various stories of VvA).</p><p>There were many others besides the Thirty-three who had their abode in T\u00e1vatimsa. Each deva had numerous retinues of attendants, and the dove-footed (kaktgap\u00e1diniyo) nymphs (acchar\u00e1) of T\u00e1vatimsa are famous in literature for their delicate beauty. The sight of these made Nanda, when escorted by the Buddha to T\u00e1vatimsa, renounce his love for Janapadakaly\u00e1n\u00ed Nand\u00e1 (J.ii.92; Ud.iii.2).</p><p>The people of Jambud\u00edpa excelled the devas of T\u00e1vatimsa in courage, mindfulness and piety (A.iv.396).

The Mah\u00e1vagga (Vin.i.28l), however, mentions a K\u00e1sika-r\u00e1j\u00e1 (king of K\u00e1si?) who sent a robe to J\u00edvaka. Buddhaghosa (see Vinaya Texts ii.195, n.2) says that this was a brother of Pasenadi and son of the same father. He was probably a sub-king of Pasenadi. Pasenadi's father, Mah\u00e1kosala, on giving his daughter in marriage to Bimbis\u00e1ra, allotted her a village of K\u00e1si (K\u00e1sig\u00e1ma, q.v.) as bath money (J.iv.342; J.ii.403; SA.i.110,120f, etc.). Even at this time, however, the memory of K\u00e1si as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men's minds. It is very frequently mentioned as such in the J\u00e1takas and elsewhere. K\u00e1si was once ruled by the Bh\u00e1ratas, one of whom, Dhatarattha, was its king in the time of Renu (D.ii.235f). There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of K\u00e1si and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other. In one such war, D\u00edgh\u00e1ti (q.v.), the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of K\u00e1si, but D\u00edgh\u00edti's son D\u00edgh\u00e1vu won back the kingdom (Vin.i.334; J.iii.487; DhA.i.46). In another war the K\u00e1si king, Mah\u00e1s\u00edlava, was taken captive by the ruler of Kosala, but his kingdom was later restored to him (J.i.262, etc.; see also i.409; UdA.123).</p><p>The traditional name of the king of K\u00e1si from time immemorial was evidently Brahmadatta (q.v.), and references to kings of that name abound in the J\u00e1takas. Sometimes the king is referred to merely as K\u00e1si-r\u00e1j\u00e1. Among other kings of K\u00e1si mentioned are Kik\u00ed (M.ii.49) and Kal\u00e1bu", "(J.iii.39). The extent of the K\u00e1si kingdom is given as three hundred leagues (J.v.41; also iii.304, 391).</p><p>The capital of K\u00e1si is generally given as B\u00e1r\u00e1nas\u00ed, but it is said that when Asoka was king of K\u00e1si his capital was in Potali (J.iii.155), and another king, Udaya-bhadda, had his seat of government in Surundha (J.iv.104ff). It is possible that these cities did not form part of the regular kingdom of K\u00e1si, but became annexed to it during the reigns of some of the more powerful kings.</p><p>K\u00e1si was evidently a great centre of trade and a most populous and prosperous country. Frequent mention is made of caravans leaving K\u00e1si to travel for trade. One highway went through K\u00e1si to R\u00e1jagaha (Vin.i.212) and another to S\u00e1vatthi (Vin.ii.10; Mhv.v.114). K\u00e1si was famed for her silks, and K\u00e1si-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts, each robe being valued at one hundred thousand. (See, e.g., J.vi.151, 450; see also Addhak\u00e1si). Mention is also made of the perfumes of K\u00e1si (K\u00e1si-vilepana (J.i.355) and K\u00e1si-candana (A.iii.391; UdA.332)).</p><p>Besides those already referred to, other names of places mentioned in literature as belonging to K\u00e1si, are V\u00e1sabhag\u00e1ma, Macchik\u00e1sanda (the kammantag\u00e1ma of An\u00e1thapindika), K\u00edt\u00e1giri and Dhammap\u00e1lag\u00e1ma (q.v.).

One day, when Kapila was reciting the P\u00e1timokkha, none of the other monks gave the responses, and in anger he declared that there was neither Dhamma nor Vinaya.

There some robbers left some stolen goods outside his hut, and Mandavya, being charged before the king, was impaled, but by virtue of his great powers he continued to live. D\u00edp\u00e1yana came to see his friend, and finding him thus and learning that he bore no ill-will towards anyone, took up his abode under his impaled body. Gouts of gore fell from Mandavya's wound on to D\u00edp\u00e1yana's golden body and there dried, forming black spots; so he came to be called Kanha-D\u00edp\u00e1yana.

But a close scrutiny of the available   information regarding the Council as well as the Buddhist activities carried   out by Kaniska shows that this tradition cannot be relied upon. It is a fact   that <span class=\"SpellE\">T\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1tha observes that all kinds of", "<span class=\"SpellE\">Mah\u00e1y\u00e1nist writing appeared at this time and that   the <span class=\"SpellE\">Therav\u00e1dins raised no objection. But he   neither clearly states nor implies that Kaniska personally took any interest   in promoting Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na teachings, or that any   Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na treatises were composed at that Council. On the other hand, it is   generally regarded that this Council was exclusively a council of the  <span class=\"SpellE\">Sarv\u00e1stiv\u00e1dins of northern India and that the  <span class=\"SpellE\">Mah\u00e1y\u00e1nists did not take part in it.<a href=\"#_edn41\" name=\"_ednref41\" title><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman\">[41]<![endif]></a>   It is apparent that after holding this Council the <span class=\"SpellE\">  Sarv\u00e1stiv\u00e1din school of Buddhism gained more importance than before.</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Whatever the tradition is there is no   reasonable ground to hold that Kaniska was responsible for the rise and rapid   spread of <span class=\"SpellE\">Mah\u00e1y\u00e1nism and that the Council held   during his reign was a Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na Buddhist<a href=\"#_edn42\" name=\"_ednref42\" title><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman\">[42]<![endif]></a>   Council.

From the accounts of the Chinese travellers of the fifth and", "seventh centuries it appears that it was one of the wonders at the time. This  <span class=\"SpellE\">st\u00fapa is said to have been 130 metres in height,   resting upon a stone substructure 50 metres high, topped by an iron mast 10   metres high with gilded metal discs. It is assumed that the original form of   the <span class=\"SpellE\">st\u00fapa as it appeared in the days of  <span class=\"GramE\">Kaniska, looked quite different from the form that   could be reconstructed from the ruins.

The object is a round pyxis, made of an  <span class=\"SpellE\">amalgum of precious metals. The lower hand of the   drum consists of representation in relief of garland bearing  <span class=\"SpellE\">erotes and Kus\u00e1na sovereign, identified by   scholars as Kaniska, between the divinities of the sun and moon; on the side   of the lid is a flock of geese (<span class=\"SpellE\">hamsa). To the top   of the cover are fastened free standing statuettes of the Buddha, flanked by   Indra and <span class=\"SpellE\">Brahm\u00e1. The most interesting feature of   the object is the Greek name of the maker, <span class=\"SpellE\">agesilas,  <span class=\"GramE\">the overseer of works at the Kaniska-<span class=\"SpellE\">caitya.   The inscription found on the reliquary also states that it was made \"for   acceptance of the teachers of the <span class=\"SpellE\">Sarv\u00e1stiv\u00e1din  <span class=\"GramE\">school\" and this is cited as evidence to prove that", "Kaniska was an adherent of this school of Buddhism.<a href=\"#_edn44\" name=\"_ednref44\" title><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman\">[44]<![endif]></a></p>  <p> </p>  <p>During <span class=\"SpellE\">Kaniska's   reign his empire was enriched through trade carried on with countries outside   India, especially with Rome and Asia Minor, and as such he had the necessary   resources to patronise the arts.

According to Benjamin Rowland \"The Art of  <span class=\"SpellE\">Gandh\u00e1ra is, properly speaking; the official art   of the <span class=\"SpellE\">Kush\u00e1n emperor Kaniska and his successors<a href=\"#_edn46\" name=\"_ednref46\" title><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman\">[46]<![endif]></a>   (see also, GANDH\u00c1RA).</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Like Asoka, Kaniska also helped   missionary activities. It was during his reign that Buddhism spread and became   firmly established in central and eastern Asia. There are no records of any   missionaries sent by him. But it is accepted that under his patronage Buddhism   greatly flourished and spread throughout his vast empire. One writer has", "observed that \"there was ceaseless missionary activity throughout his vast   empire which extended from <span class=\"SpellE\">Madhyadesa in India to   Central Asia.

Kat\u00e1haka acquired various arts in the company of his master. When he grew up he was appointed as the Treasurer's private secretary. One day he visited a merchant on the frontier, carrying a letter purporting to be from the Treasurer (in which he was stated to be the son of the latter), asking for the hand of the merchant's daughter in marriage. The merchant was overjoyed, and the marriage took place. Kat\u00e1haka gave himself great airs and spoke contemptuously of everything \"provincial.\" The Treasurer, discovering what had happened, decided to visit the merchant, but Kat\u00e1haka went to meet him on the way, and paying him all the honour due from a slave, begged him not to expose him. Meanwhile, he had misled his wife's relations into the belief that the homage, paid by him to the Treasurer, was but the regard due from a son to his father. He was not like the sons of other parents, but knew what was due to his father. The Bodhisatta, being pleased, did not expose the slave, but on learning from Kat\u00e1haka's wife that Kat\u00e1haka always complained of his food, he taught her a stanza which contained the threat - not intelligible to her, though clear to Kat\u00e1haka - that if Kat\u00e1haka continued to make a nuisance of himself, the Treasurer would return and expose him.

In the Buddha's time it was a prosperous place where provisions could easily be obtained (dabbasambh\u00e1rasulabh\u00e1) (J.iv.310). Once when the Buddha was staying in the Veluvana at Kajangala, the lay followers there heard a sermon from the Buddha and went to the nun Kajangal\u00e1 to have it explained in detail (A.v.54f).

It was founded by the sons of Okk\u00e1ka, on the site of the hermitage of the sage Kapila - see Kapila (3) (J.i.15, 49, 50, 54, 64, etc.; see also Divy 548, and Buddhacarita I.v.2). Near the city was the Lumbin\u00edvana (q.v.) where the Buddha was born, and which became one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists. Close to Kapilavatthu flowed the river Rohin\u00ed, which formed the boundary between the kingdoms of the S\u00e1kyans and the Koliyans (DhA.iii.254). In the sixth century B.C. Kapilavatthu was the centre of a republic, at the head of which was Suddhodana. The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santh\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1 (D.i.91; J.iv.145). It was here that Vid\u00fadabha was received by the S\u00e1kyans (J.iv.146f). The walls of the city were eighteen cubits high (J.i.63; according to Mtu.ii.75 it had seven walls). From Kapilavatthu to the river Anom\u00e1, along the road taken by Gotama, when he left his home, was a distance of thirty yojanas (J.i.64). The city was sixty leagues from R\u00e1jagaha, and the Buddha took two months covering this distance when he visited his ancestral home, in the first year after his Enlightenment. On this journey the Buddha was accompanied by twenty thousand monks, and K\u00e1lud\u00e1y\u00ed went on ahead as harbinger. The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma near the city and, in the midst of his kinsmen, as he did at the foot of the Gandamba, the Buddha performed the Yamakap\u00e1tih\u00e1riya to convince them of his powers. (J.i.87ff; this journey to Kapilavatthu was one of the scenes depicted in the relic-chamber of the Mah\u00e1-Th\u00fapa, Mhv.xxx.81).</p><p>On this occasion he preached the Vessantara J\u00e1taka. The next day the Buddha went begging in the city to the great", "horror of his father, who, on being explained that such was the custom of all Buddhas, became a sot\u00e1panna and invited the Buddha and his monks to the palace. After the meal the Buddha preached to the women of the palace who, with the exception of R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1, had all come to hear him. At the end of the sermon, Suddhodana became a sakad\u00e1g\u00e1m\u00ed and Mah\u00e1-Paj\u00e1pat\u00ed a sot\u00e1panna. The Buddha visited R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1 in her dwelling and preached to her the Candakinnara J\u00e1taka. The next day Nanda was ordained, and seven days later R\u00e1hula (also Vin.i.82). As a result of the latter's ordination, a rule was passed by the Buddha, at Suddhodana's request, that no one should be ordained without the sanction of his parents, if they were alive. On the eighth day was preached the Mah\u00e1dhammap\u00e1la J\u00e1taka, and the king became an an\u00e1g\u00e1m\u00ed. The Buddha returned soon after to R\u00e1jagaha, stopping on the way at Anupiy\u00e1, where the conversions of Ananda, Devadatta, Bhagu, Anuruddha, and Kimbila took place. </p><p>During the visit to Kapilavatthu, eighty thousand S\u00e1kyans from eighty thousand families had joined the Buddhist Order (Vin.ii.180; DhA.i.112; iv.124, etc.). According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.4; Bu. p.5f), it was during this visit that, at the request of S\u00e1riputta, the Buddha preached the Buddhavamsa. It is not possible to ascertain how many visits in all were paid by the Buddha to his native city, but it may be gathered from various references that he went there several times; two visits, in addition to the first already mentioned, were considered particularly memorable. On one of these he arrived in Kapilavatthu to prevent the S\u00e1kyans and the Koliyans, both his kinsmen, from fighting each other over the question of their sharing the water of the Rohin\u00ed; he appeared before them as they were preparing to slay each other, and convinced them of the futility of their wrath. On this", "occasion were preached the following J\u00e1takas: the Phandana, the Daddabha, the Latukika, the Rukkhadhamma, and the Vattaka - also the Attadanda Sutta. Delighted by the intervention of the Buddha, the two tribes each gave him two hundred and fifty youths to enter his Order and, with these, he went on his alms rounds alternately to Kapilavatthu and to the capital of the Koliyans (J.v.412ff; the Sammodam\u00e1na J\u00e1taka also seems to have been preached in reference to this quarrel, J.i.208). On this occasion he seems to have resided, not at the Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma, but in the Mah\u00e1vana.</p><p>The second visit of note was that paid by the Buddha when Vid\u00fadabha (q.v), chagrined by the insult of the S\u00e1kyans, invaded Kapilavatthu in order to take his revenge. Three times Vid\u00fadabha came with his forces, and three times he found the Buddha seated on the outskirts of Kapilavatthu, under a tree which gave him scarcely any shade; near by was a shady banyan-tree, in Vid\u00fadabha's realm; on being invited by Vid\u00fadabha to partake of its shade, the Buddha replied, \"Let be, O king; the shade of my kindred keeps me cool.\" Thus three times Vid\u00fadabha had to retire, his purpose unaccomplished; but the fourth time the Buddha, seeing the fate of the S\u00e1kyans, did not interfere (J.iv.152).</p><p>The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu. On one such visit he preached the Kanha J\u00e1taka (J.iv.6ff). Various S\u00e1kyans went to see him both at the Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma and at the Mah\u00e1vana, among them being Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma (S.v.369f; A.iii.284f; iv.220f; v.320f), Nandiya (S.v.403f; 397f; A.v.334f), Vappa (A.ii.196; M.i.91), and perhaps S\u00e1rak\u00e1ni (S.v.372).</p><p>During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the S\u00e1kyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked", "Moggall\u00e1na to carry on while he slept. We are told that the S\u00e1kyans decorated the town with lights for a yojana round, and stopped all noise while the Buddha was in the mote-hall (MA.ii.575). On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta (M.i.353ff).</p><p>The books record a visit paid by the Brahm\u00e1 Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mah\u00e1vana at Kapilavatthu. (This appears, from the context, to have been quite close to the Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma.)</p><p>The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life (S.iii.91f; Ud.25).</p><p>A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharandu, the K\u00e1l\u00e1man (A.i.276f). On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness (A.i.219).</p><p>Not all the S\u00e1kyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman's great powers, even after the Buddha's performance of various miracles. We find, for instance, Dandap\u00e1n\u00ed meeting the Buddha in the Mah\u00e1vana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha's explanations, Dandap\u00e1n\u00ed shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles (M.i.108f.; this was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupindika Sutta). </p>", "<p>Others were more convinced and patronised the Order - e.g., K\u00e1la-Khemaka and Ghat\u00e1ya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma (M.iii.109. As a result of noticing these cells, the Buddha preached the Mahasu\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1ta Sutta).</p><p>It is said that the Buddha ordained ten thousand householders of Kapilavatthu with the \"ehi-bhikkhu-pabbaj\u00e1.\" (Sp.i.241)</p><p>Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma (q.v.) was the Buddha's most frequent visitor; to him was preached the C\u00faladukkhakkhandha Sutta (M.i.91f).</p><p>The Dakkhin\u00e1-vibhanga Sutta was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mah\u00e1-Paj\u00e1pat\u00ed-Gotam\u00ed. Apart from those already mentioned, another S\u00e1kyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, K\u00e1ligodh\u00e1 by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha's father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha (S.v.396).</p><p>The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kapilavatthav\u00e1 (E.g., S.iv.182).</p><p>From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Ves\u00e1l\u00ed (Vin.ii.253), and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by B\u00e1var\u00ed's disciples from Alaka to S\u00e1vatthi (Sn.p.194).</p><p>From the Mah\u00e1vana, outside Kapilavatthu, the forest extended up to the Himalaya, and on the other side of the city it reached as far as the sea (MA.i.449, UdA.184; Sp.ii.393).</p><p>It is significant that, in spite of the accounts given of the greatness of Kapilavatthu, it was not mentioned by Ananda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1 (D.ii.146). After the Buddha's death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the S\u00e1kyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.2). Here was deposited the rug (paccattharana) used by the Buddha (Bu.xxviii.8).</p><p>In the northern books the city was", "called Kapilavastu, Kapilapura, and Kapil\u00e1vhayapura (E.g. Lal. p.243, 28; The Buddha-carita, I.v.2 calls it Kapilasyavastu). According to the Dulva (Rockhill, p.11), the city was on the banks of the Bhag\u00edrath\u00ed.</p><p>The identification of Kapilavatthu is not yet beyond the realm of conjecture. Hiouen Thsang (Beal ii.,p.13f) visited the city and found it like a wilderness. The Asoka inscriptions of the Lumbin\u00ed pillar and the Nigl\u00edva pillar are helpful in determining the site. Some identify the modern village of Pipr\u00e1w\u00e1 - famous for the vases found there - with Kapilavatthu (E.g., Fleet, J.R.A.S.1906, p.180; CAGI.711f). Others, including Rhys Davids, say there were two cities, one ancient and the other modern, founded after Vid\u00fadabha's conquest, and the ancient one they call Tilaura Kot. But the theory of two Kapilavatthu is rejected by some scholars. J.R.A.S.1906, pp.453, 563.

He thereupon conceived hatred against all crows. Soon after that a woman slave, watching some rice spread out in the sun to dry, was angered by a goat who, as soon as she fell asleep, started to eat the rice. In exasperation she fetched a torch and struck the goat's shaggy back, which caught fire. To ease its pain, the goat ran into the hayshed near the king's elephant-stalls and rolled in the hay. In the conflagration that ensued many of the elephants were badly burnt, and when the chaplain was consulted, remembering his anger against crows, he said that the cure for burns was crows' fat. Crows were accordingly being mercilessly slaughtered; the Bodhisatta, hearing of this sought the king and explained to him the chaplain's motive. Crows had no fat, he said, because their life is passed in ceaseless dread. The king, being greatly pleased with the Bodhisatta's act, granted immunity to all living beings, showing particular favour towards crows.</p><p>The circumstances which led to the recital of the story are described in the Bhaddas\u00e1la J\u00e1taka (q.v.).

Soothsayers foretold that the younger would be an ascetic, but that his son would be a Cakka-vatti. Knowing of this prophecy, Culla K\u00e1linga became so arrogant that Mah\u00e1 K\u00e1linga, on coming to the throne, ordered his arrest. But Culla K\u00e1linga fled to Himav\u00e1 and lived there as an ascetic. Near his hermitage lived the king and queen of Madda who had fled with their daughter from their city of S\u00e1gala. Soothsayers had predicted that the princess's son would be a Cakka-vatti, and all the kings of Jambud\u00edpa sought her hand. Her parents, not wishing to incur the enmity of any of the kings, fled with her from the city. One day a wreath of mango-flowers which the princess dropped into the river was picked up by Culla K\u00e1linga, who thereupon went in search of her.

On the fifteenth day after his coronation, the tokens of a Cakka-vatti king appeared before him. (For details see J.iv.232). One day while riding through the air with his retinue, he came to the Bodhi-tree under which Buddhas attain Enlightenment, and though he prodded his elephant until it died the animal found it impossible to fly over the spot.

S\u00e1m\u00e1, sending word to the governor that the robber was her brother, persuaded him, by means of a bribe of one thousand pieces of money, to set him free and send him to her for a little while. Then, using all her guile, she substituted for the robber a youth who was enamoured of her and who had happened to visit her that day. This youth was killed in the place of the robber, who was brought to S\u00e1m\u00e1, and she showered on him all her favours. Fearing that when S\u00e1m\u00e1 grew tired of him she might betray him, the robber went with her one day into the park and, on the pretence of embracing her, squeezed her till she swooned, then taking all her ornaments, made good his escape. S\u00e1m\u00e1, all unsuspecting, imagined him to have run away from fear of having killed her by his too violent embraces, and she used all her ingenuity in searching for him, such as bribing some wandering minstrels to sing, wherever they went, a set of stanzas declaring that she was still alive and loved none but him, her lover. One day the robber heard the stanzas and learned from the minstrels that S\u00e1m\u00e1 still longed for him, but he refused to return, sending her word that he doubted her constancy.

One day the king, returning from a procession, saw the misshapen creature, and asked the chaplain if such a man could ever win the love of a woman. The cripple, hearing the question, proudly boasted of his intimacy with the queen. At the chaplain's suggestion the king watched the queen's movements that same night, and saw the cripple abuse her and strike her for being late in coming.

A sermon attributed to Kassapa, when he once visited Benares with twenty thousand monks, is included in the story of Pandita-S\u00e1manera (DhA.ii.127ff).

He became Yuvar\u00e1ja under Kassapa IV. and ruled over Dakkhinadesa (Cv.lii.1), and, at the death of the king, he became ruler of Ceylon as Kassapa V. (probably 913-23 A.C.) (Cv.lii.37ff).

In inscriptions Kassapa is referred to as Abhaya-Sil\u00e1megha-vanna (Cv.Trs.i.165, n.3). He was evidently a learned man, and a Sinhalese Commentary to the Dhammapadatthakath\u00e1 is attributed to him (Edited by D. B. Jayatilaka, Colombo 1933).

Kassapa ascended the throne as Vikkamab\u00e1hu, but refused to be crowned until he should have conquered the Damilas in his kingdom. While preparations were afoot towards this end, he died of a v\u00e1taroga. He reigned twelve years (1029-1041 A.C.). (Cv.lvi.1-6; Cv.Trs.i.190, n.3).

The lot fell", "repeatedly on Kassapa, because, in a former life, he had harassed a dog in the water. He was accordingly thrown overboard, but was rescued by Sakka, in the form of a crocodile. The thera reached Yakkhad\u00edpa (q.v.) and there, as a result of practising compassion, the blind yakkhas gained their sight. Kassapa went later to S\u00edhalad\u00edpa, whence he returned home with relics and seeds of the Bodhi-tree and models of the Mah\u00e1cetiya and Lohap\u00e1s\u00e1da.</p><hr><p><b>27.

He was the younger son of the daughter of a rich merchant of R\u00e1jagaha, who developed intimacy with a slave and fled with him when her misconduct was discovered. She wished to return to her parents for the birth of her first child, but her husband always postponed the visit until, in the end, she started to go without his knowledge. He followed her, but the child was born by the wayside, and therefore they called him Panthaka. The same thing occurred at the birth of the second child, and he also received the name of Panthaka, he being C\u00falapanthaka and his brother Mah\u00e1panthaka. When the boys grew up they were taken to R\u00e1jagaha, where their grandparents took charge of them. Mah\u00e1panthaka often accompanied his grandfather to hear the Buddha preach, and he yearned to become a monk. He easily obtained permission and entered the Order, in due course becoming an arahant. With the consent of his grandparents, he ordained C\u00falapanthaka, but the latter proved to be a dullard, and in the course of four months was unable to learn a single stanza. It is said that in the time of Kassapa Buddha C\u00falapanthaka was a clever monk, who once laughed to scorn a dull colleague who was trying to learn a passage by heart.</p><p>When Mah\u00e1panthaka discovered his brother's stupidity, he asked him to leave the Order (see DhA.iv.190f), but C\u00falapanthaka so loved the Buddha's teaching that he did not wish to return to the lay-life. One day J\u00edvaka Kom\u00e1rabhacca, wishing to give alms to the Buddha and the monks, asked Mah\u00e1panthaka, who was acting as steward, to collect all the monks in the monastery. This he did, omitting only C\u00falapanthaka who, he said,", "had made no progress in the Doctrine. Greatly grieved, C\u00falapanthaka determined to leave the Order, but as he was going out the Buddha met him, took him into the Gandhakuti and comforted him, giving him a clean piece of cloth. \"Sit with your face to the East,\" said the Buddha, \"repeat the words 'rajoha-ranam' and wipe your face with the cloth.\" As C\u00falapanthaka carried out these orders he noticed that the cloth became dirty, and as he concentrated his mind on the impermanence of all things, the Buddha sent a ray of light and exhorted him about the necessity of getting rid of the impurities of lust and other evils. At the end of the admonition C\u00falapanthaka attained arahantship with the four patisambhid\u00e1, which included knowledge of all the Pitakas.</p><p>Tradition has it that C\u00falapanthaka was once a king and that while going in procession round his city he wiped the sweat from his brow with a spotless garment which he wore and noticed how the cloth was stained. His mind then grasped the idea of impermanence, hence the ease with which he did so in his last birth.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Buddha and the monks were seated in J\u00edvaka's house, but when the meal was about to be served the Buddha ordered it to be stopped, saying that there were other monks left in the monastery. A servant was sent to find them, and C\u00falapanthaka, aware of this, contrived that the whole grove appeared full of monks engaged in various activities. When the messenger reported this, he was told to discover which of the monks was C\u00falapanthaka and to bring him. But all the monks answered to this name, and the messenger was forced to return without him. \"Take by the hand the first who says that he is C\u00falapanthaka,\" ordered the Buddha; and when this was done the other figures vanished. At the conclusion of the meal, C\u00falapanthaka was", "asked to return thanks, and \"like a young lion roaring defiance\" the Elder ranged over the whole of the Pitakas in his sermon. Thenceforth his fame spread, and the Buddha, in order to prove how in previous births also C\u00falapanthaka had profited by advice received, related to the monks the Cullakasetthi J\u00e1taka (Thag.557-66; AA.i.119ff; J.i.114ff; DhA.i.239ff; ThagA.i.515ff; Vsm.388f).</p><p> </p><p>The Dhammapada Commentary (i.250ff) gives another story of C\u00falapanthaka's past. He went to Takkasil\u00e1 to learn under a teacher, but though he did everything for his teacher he could learn nothing. The teacher, feeling sorry for him, taught him a charm: \"Ghattesi ghattesi, kim k\u00e1ran\u00e1 ghattesi? \u00e1ham pi tam j\u00e1n\u00e1mi\" (\"You try and try; what are you trying for? I know it too\"). When he had returned home thieves entered his house, but he woke up from his sleep and repeated the charm, whereupon the thieves fled, leaving behind them even their clothes. The king of Benares, wandering about the city in disguise, seeing what had happened, sent for C\u00falapanthaka the next day and learnt from him the charm after paying him one thousand. Soon after-wards the king's commander-in-chief bribed the court barber to cut the king's throat, but while the barber was sharpening his razor the king repeated the charm. The barber, thinking that his intended crime was discovered, confessed his guilt. The king, realising that the youth had saved his life, appointed him commander-in-chief in place of the traitor, whom he banished. The youth was C\u00falapanthaka and the teacher was the Bodhisatta.</p><p>C\u00falapanthaka was a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and having seen a monk exalted by the Buddha to the rank of chief among those skilled in creating mind-born forms, aspired to the same position. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk and practised", "od\u00e1takasina for twenty thousand years (AA.i.119).</p><p>C\u00falapanthaka was expert in r\u00fapajjh\u00e1na and in sam\u00e1dhi, while his brother was skilled in ar\u00fapajjh\u00e1na and in vipassan\u00e1. When creating forms, other monks could produce only two or three, while C\u00falapanthaka could bring into being as many as one thousand at the same time, no two being alike in appearance or action (ThagA.i.490; PsA.276).</p><p>According to the Apad\u00e1na (i.58f), C\u00falapanthaka joined the Order at the age of eighteen. It is said (Vin.iv.54f) that when it was his turn to teach the nuns at S\u00e1vatthi they expected no effective teaching, since he always repeated the same stanza. One day, at the end of the lesson, he overheard their remarks, and forthwith gave an exhibition of his magical powers and of his wide knowledge of the Buddha's teachings. The nuns listened with great admiration until after sunset, when they were unable to gain entrance to the city. The Buddha heard of this and warned C\u00falapanthaka not to keep the nuns so late.</p><p>The Ud\u00e1na (v.10; UdA.319f) contains a verse sung by the Buddha in praise of C\u00falapanthaka, and the Milinda (p.368) quotes a stanza attributed to C\u00falapanthaka which has so far not been traced elsewhere.</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Cullakasetthi J\u00e1taka (No.4)</h2>  </li></ul><p>Once the Bodhisatta was born as Cullakasetthi in <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')\">Benares</a>.

(i.155) says he was the son of a servant woman of Suddhodana). When Gotama left household life, Channa rode with him on the horse Kanthaka as far as the river Anom\u00e1. There Gotama gave him his ornaments and bade him take Kanthaka back to his father's palace (A th\u00fapa was later erected on the spot where Channa turned back; Dvy.391). When, however, Kanthaka died of a broken heart, Channa's grief was great, for he had suffered a double loss. It is said that he begged for leave to join Gotama as a recluse, but this leave was refused (J.i.64f). He therefore returned to Kapilavatthu, but when the Buddha visited his S\u00e1kiyan kinsfolk, Channa joined the Order. Because of his great affection for the Buddha, however, egotistical pride in \"our Buddha, our Doctrine\" arose in him and he could not conquer this fondness nor fulfil his duties as a bhikkhu. (ThagA.i.155; his verse (No.69) quoted in Thag. does not, however, refer to any such remissness on his part).</p><p> </p><p>Once, when in the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma in Kosamb\u00ed, Channa committed a fault but was not willing to acknowledge it.

He therefore changed his residence, but was everywhere \"boycotted,\" and returned to Kosamb\u00ed subdued and asking for reprieve, which was granted to him. Vin.ii.23ff. His obstinacy and perverseness are again mentioned elsewhere - e.g., Vin.iv.35, 113, 141. A patron of his once erected a vih\u00e1ra for him, but he so thatched and decked it that it fell down. In trying to repair it he damaged a brahmin's barley field (Vin.iii.47). See also Vin.iii.155f., 177.</p>", "<p>Later, in a dispute between the monks and the nuns, he deliberately sided with the latter; this was considered so perverse and so lacking in proper esprit de corps, that the Buddha decreed on him the carrying out of the Brahmadanda whereby all monks were forbidden to have anything whatsoever to do with him. This was the last disciplinary act of the Buddha, and the carrying out thereof was entrusted to Ananda. D.ii.154. It would, however, appear from DhA.ii.110 that the Brahmadanda was inflicted on Channa for his having repeatedly reviled S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na in spite of the Buddha's warning.

His name was Pajjota, the sobriquet being added on account of his violent temper. </p><p>Once, when ill with jaundice, he asked <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')\">Bimbis\u00e1ra</a> to lend him the services of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/j/jiivaka')\">J\u00edvaka</a>, as no other doctor could cure him. The cure for the malady was ghee, for which Pajjota had a strong aversion. J\u00edvaka, therefore, decided to administer it disguised in an astringent decoction, and obtained the king's permission to use any of the royal animals or to leave the city at any time he wished, on the plea that he must go in search of various medicines. When all preparations were complete, J\u00edvaka gave the king the medicine and escaped on Bhaddavatik\u00e1, the king's she-elephant, before the truth was discovered. (The elephant could travel fifty yojanas in one day, and <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaaka')\">K\u00e1ka</a>, sixty). The king sent K\u00e1ka in pursuit, but J\u00edvaka gave K\u00e1ka a purgative and so delayed his return until the medicine had taken effect on the king. Later, when Pajjota was cured, he sent J\u00edvaka many costly presents, including a garment of Siveyyaka cloth (Vin.i.276ff; AA.i.216).</p><p>King <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena')\">Udena</a> was Pajjota's rival in splendour, and Pajjota decided to take him captive by taking advantage of his fondness for elephants. The plan succeeded and Udena was taken prisoner, but in the end Udena eloped with Pajjota's daughter, <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasuladattaa')\">V\u00e1suladatt\u00e1</a>, and made her his queen consort. Besides the she-elephant and the slave K\u00e1ka, already mentioned, Pajjota had three other fleet-footed conveyances: two mares, Celakanth\u00ed and", "Mu\u00f1jakes\u00ed, both capable of travelling one hundred leagues a day, and an elephant, N\u00e1l\u00e1giri, able to go one hundred and twenty leagues a day. In a past birth Pajjota had been the servitor of a certain chief. One day, when the chief was returning from the bath, he saw a Pacceka Buddha leaving the city, where he had begged for alms without receiving anything. The chief hurried home and, finding that his meal was ready, sent it to the Pacceka Buddha by the hand of his fleet-footed servant. The servant travelled with all possible haste and, having given the meal to the Pacceka Buddha, expressed certain wishes, as the result of which in this birth he gained possession of the five conveyances. He had authority equal to the power of the sun's rays. (This may be another explanation of the nickname Canda). His last wish was that he should partake of the Truth realised by the Pacceka Buddha (DhA.i.196ff).</p><p><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')\">Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na</a> was the son of Pajjota's chaplain and later succeeded to his father's post. When the king heard of the Buddha's appearance in the world, he sent Kacc\u00e1na with seven others to the Buddha, to bring him to Ujjeni. But the Buddha sent Kacc\u00e1na and his companions, now become arahants, to preach to the king and establish the S\u00e1sana in Avanti. The mission was successful. The Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 contains stanzas uttered by the Thera in admonition to the king. It is said that the king had faith in the brahmins and held sacrifices involving the slaughter of animals; he was wicked in his deeds. One night he had a dream which frightened him and went to the Thera to have it explained. The Thera told him of the necessity for leading a virtuous life. We are told that from that day the king abandoned his evil ways and lived righteously (Thag.vs.496-501; ThagA.i.483ff; AA.i.116f).</p><p>According to the Dulva (Rockhill, op.", "cit., 17), Pajjota was the son of Anantanemi and was born on the same day as the Buddha. He was called Pajjota (Pradyota), because at the time of his birth the world was illumined as if by a lamp. He became king of Ujjeni at the time of the Buddha's Enlightenment (Rockhill, op. cit., 32, n.1). He had a minister called Bharata, a clever mechanic (Rockhill, op. cit., 70, n.1).</p><p>It would appear from the Samantap\u00e1s\u00e1dik\u00e1 (Sp.i.214) that Pajjota was born as the result of an ascetic, or some other holy person, having touched the navel of his mother.</p><p>Pajjota was the friend of Bimbis\u00e1ra, and when the latter was put to death by <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')\">Aj\u00e1tasattu</a>, Pajjota seems to have made preparations to wage war on Aj\u00e1tasattu.

The relics, obtained by Sumanas\u00e1manera from Asoka and from Sakka, were deposited there until they were needed. According to the Mah\u00e1vamsa (Mhv.xxii.23ff) this fact was the occasion for the name. One of the eight saplings of the Sacred Bodhi-tree at Anur\u00e1dhapura was planted in the drama on Cetiyagiri (Mhv.xix.62). Mahinda spent the last years of his life on Cetiyagiri and died there, and there his relics were enshrined (Mhv.xx.32, 45). Near the mountain was the village of Dv\u00e1ramandala (Mhv.xxiii.23). Kutakannatissa built an uposatha-hall on the mountain and planted a Bodhi-tree, while Bh\u00e1ti-k\u00e1bhaya supplied food daily to one thousand monks dwelling there (Mhv.xxxiv.30f, 64), and La\u00f1jakatissa had the vih\u00e1ra paved at a cost of one hundred thousand (Mhv.xxxiii.25).

Kaniraj\u00e1nutissa had sixty monks of Cetiyapabbata put to death as traitors by flinging them into the cave called Kanira (Mhv.xxxv.11).

On its banks was a grove of campaka-trees, well known for the fragrance of their marvellous white flowers, and there, in the Buddha's time, wandering teachers were wont to lodge. The Buddha himself stayed thereon several occasions (Vin.i.312; S.i.195; A.iv.59, 168; v.151, 189). S\u00e1riputta (A.iv.59) and Vang\u00edsa (S.i.195) are also said to have stayed there.

It lay at a distance of sixty yojanas from Mithil\u00e1 (J.iv.32). In the Buddha's time the people of Camp\u00e1 owed allegiance to Bimbis\u00e1ra, as king of Magadha, and Bimbis\u00e1ra had given a royal fief in Camp\u00e1 to the brahmin Sonadanda (D.i.111). Camp\u00e1 was evidently an important centre of trade, and we are told that merchants travelled from there to Suvannabh\u00fami for purposes of trade (E.g., J.vi.539).

But the legends connected with them are so confused that it is not possible to differentiate clearly one from the other.  </p><p>Mention is also made of a <b>Cunda-Samanuddesa</b> whom, however, the Commentaries (E.g.. DA.iii.907) identify with Mah\u00e1-Cunda. Mah\u00e1-Cunda is, for instance, described in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 Commentary (ThagA.i.261; see also DhA.ii.188 and AA.ii.674) as the younger brother of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')\">S\u00e1riputta</a>, under whom he", "joined the Order, winning arahantship after arduous and strenuous effort. </p><p>In the time of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')\">Vipass\u00ed</a> Buddha he had been a potter and had given to the Buddha a bowl made of clay. The Apad\u00e1na verses quoted in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 Commentary are, in the Apad\u00e1na itself (Ap.ii.444), ascribed to a monk named<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekapattadaayaka_th')\">Ekapattad\u00e1yaka</a>. They make no mention whatever of his relationship to S\u00e1riputta. On the other hand, there are to be found elsewhere in the Apad\u00e1na (Ap.i.101f) certain verses ascribed to a Cunda Thera, which definitely state that he was the son of the brahmin<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/va/vanganta')\">Vanganta</a>, and that his mother was <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/r/rupasari')\">S\u00e1r\u00ed</a>. But in these verses he is called C\u00fala-Cunda, and mention is made of his previous birth in the time of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/siddhattha')\">Siddhattha</a> Buddha, to whom he gave a bouquet of jasmine flowers. As a result he became king of the devas seventy-seven times and was once king of men, by name Dujjaya. It is further stated that he became arahant while yet a s\u00e1manera and that he waited upon the Buddha and his own brother and other virtuous monks. This account goes on to say that after his brother's death, Cunda brought his relics in a bowl and presented them to the Buddha, who uttered praises of S\u00e1riputta. This would identify C\u00fala-Cunda with Cunda Samanuddesa who, according to the Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya (S.v.161f), attended S\u00e1riputta in his last illness and, after his death, brought to the Buddha at <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')\">Jetavana</a> S\u00e1riputta's bowl and outer robe and his relics wrapt in his water-strainer.

There Hs\u00faan-tsang followed lectures on the scriptures delivered by eminent scholars and in a few years he mastered the scriptures of various schools and earned a name as a scholar. It was about this time or a few years later that he came to be known by the appellation \"The Master of the Law\".</p><p>In the fifth year of Wu-te he received full ordination at Ch'eng-tu. He went to Chin-chow for further studies where he also conducted sermons as an advanced student. Scholar monks who gathered there as listeners treated him with great respect and admiration. Thereupon he went to Chaochow, Hsiang-chow and Ch'ang-an and studied the Samyukt\u00e1bhidharma-hrdaya, the Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na-sangraha, the Abhidharma-kosa etc.</p><p>In a short time Ht. mastered all the theories of the different schools of Buddhism and was acclaimed as a great scholar. He found that Buddhist teachings he had learned, mainly those concerned with the theory of Dharmalaksana and the views held by the propounders of the Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na-Sangraha and those held by the followers of the Dasabh\u00famivy\u00e1karana were at variance. Moreover, he discerned many defects in the Chinese translations of the sacred books, and consequently he cherished the idea of going to India to", "learn at the feet of orthodox scholars. In this he was inspired to some extent by his forerunners Fa-hsien and Chi-yen who undertook similar tasks.</p><p>Overcoming many obstacles Ht., at the age of twenty-six years set forth from Chang-an and going through several provinces or countries came to Liang-chow where he received a companion to travel to the West. Despite the attempts of spies to detain him the governor of the province, Li-chiang, however, let him proceed on his journey. Some of the territories or countries which he traversed until he reached the borders of North India were Turfan (Kau-chang), Agni (O-ki-ni), Kuche (Kiuchi) an oasis in the Gobi desert, Nujkend (Nu-chin-kien), Chaf (Che-shi), Ferghanah (Fei-han in Turkestan), Sutrishna (Su-tu-Ii-sse-na), Samarkhand (Sa-mo-kien), Kesh (Ki-shwang-na), Kunduz (Hwo), Bhaktra or Bactria (Fo-ho-lo), Bamiyam (Fan-yen-na) and Kapisa (Kia-pi-she).</p><p>His journey was beset with dangers and hardships. As the only guide given him to accompany until the last of the watch towers in sandy desert also deserted him he went on all alone. The worst experience encountered was in the heart of the Mo-kia-yen desert which extended for 800 li. One hundred li after entering the desert he lost his way. By accident his water bag gave way without leaving a drop of water in it and he had to spend four nights and five days in the desert without water.</p><p>At a later stage when wending their way up the snow-clad Ling mountain, and the snowy mountain (Hindukush) lying to the south of Balkh, twelve or fourteen of his companions and an even greater number of oxen and horses met with death.</p><p>Obstacles caused by robbers on his way to India and also in India itself were more than embarrassing. Even governors or kings of certain countries embarrassed him as he was proceeding towards India.", "Although very hospitable and respectful to Ht. the king of Kam-chang, Khio-wen-tai planned to detain him in his court as his spiritual head. Ht. got out of this grip only by the threat of fasting unto death. Another attempt to detain him was made by the Great Khan of the Turks. As will appear below, Ht. underwent another such experience in Eastern India as well.</p><p>Of the countries which were traversed by Ht. on his way to North India, Bhaktra (Po-ho-lo), Bamiyan (Fanyen-na) and Kapisa (Kia-pi-she) were active centres of Buddhism. According to Ht, there were about three thousand monks of the Little Vehicle in Bhaktra. There was a scholar monk called Praj\u00f1\u00e1kara who was versed in the three pitakas of the Little Vehicle. Ht. was pleased with his explanation of the doctrine of that school.</p><p>Ht. reached Bamiyan crossing Hindu-kush. In both Bamiyan and Kapisa, there were several thousand monks of the Little Vehicle. In Bamiyan there were three imposing figures of the Buddha. One of these was a standing figure of about 140 or 150 feet high. Another figure of the standing Buddha measures 100 feet in height. An enormous figure of the recumbent Buddha depicting his 'Nirvana' measures 1000 feet in length.</p><p>At a conference held in a temple of the Great Vehicle in Kapisa Ht. being thorough with the teachings of both schools, proved his superiority over all who participated in it. From Kapisa onwards his itinerary covered territories in North India of which the following place names are graphed by Ht. into a separate unit. Lamghan (Lanpo), Nagarahara (Na-kie-to-ho), Gandhara (Kien-to-lo), Udyana (U-chang), Takshasila (Ta-ch'a-shi-lo), Urasa (Wu-la-sa), Kashmir (Kia-shi-mi-lo), Punach (Pun-nuh-t'so) and Rajapuri (Ho-lo-she-pu-lo). According to Ht, common people in the above territories differ to some extent from those of India in respect of manners, clothing and", "language.</p><p>Si-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World (Records) ed. Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1981, Bk. II, pp. 68, 917; The Life of Hiuen Tsiang (=The Life) ed. Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1973, pp. 57-72. The countries from Lamgham to Rajapuri both inclusive were not regarded by the people of India proper as forming parts of their territory (Watters, Thomas, On Yuang Chwang's Travels in India, pub. Munshi Ram Manohar Lal, Oriental Publishers and Booksellers, Delhi, 1961, p. 180, (Abbreviated as Watters).</p><p>Nagarahara (Jelalabad) occupies a prominent place as a country possessing Buddha's relics. In Nagarahara or its neighbourhood Ht. rejoined his companions and went to Gandhara by the Khyber Pass. He gives the names of a number of sages and saints who composed s\u00e1stras there. Then he goes to describe the famous stupa of 400 feet in height ascribed to king Kanishka. It was situated in Purushapura (Po-lu-shu-po-lo), the capital of Gandhara.</p><p>Either side of the river Subhavastu (Su-po-fa-sa-tu) in the country of Udyana is said by Ht. to have been thickly populated by Buddhists in former days. At the time of his visit he saw the country depopulated. The few monks who were there at the time belonged to five different schools viz. the Dharmaguptas, the Mahis\u00e1sakas, the Kasyapiyas, the Sarv\u00e1stivadins and the Mah\u00e1sanghikas. Among the objects of worship are mentioned figures of Avalokitesvara and Maitreya bodhisattva.</p><p>In Takshasila, Urasa and Kashmir, too, he saw various Buddhist sites. The chief monk in Kashmir was of high moral character and of remarkable intelligence. This monk explained many parts of the doctrine to him. This learned teacher was so impressed by Ht. that the latter was compared to Asanga bodhisattva in respect of his wisdom. According to Ht.<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaniska')\">Kanishka</a>, convened an assembly, known to history", "as the Fourth Council, in the four hundredth year from the 'Nirvana' of the Tath\u00e1gata. Ht. stayed for two years studying sutras and s\u00e1stras.</p><p>Leaving Kashmir Ht. made his way to Punach and from there to Rajapuri. From Rajapuri he entered a different zone in North India arriving at Takka (Teheka) as its starting point. To the east of the town called Narasimha (Na-lo-sang-ho) he and the accompanying s\u00e1maneras encountered a band of fifty robbers who robbed them of their belongings. However, a brahmin in the neighbourhood came to their help and they managed to escape with no loss of life. There he remained for one month, and for fourteen months in the kingdom of Chinapati (Chi-na-po-tai) studying various texts.</p><p>Before reaching the next important kingdom, Mathura (Mo-t'u-lo) he passed through the kingdoms of Jalandhara (She-lan-t'o-lo), Kuluta (Kiu-la-ta), Satadra (Shete-to-lu) and Paryatra (Po-li-ye-to-to). An interesting custom of making offerings in honour of the disciples of the Buddha is said to have prevailed in Mathura. The followers of Abhidhamma made offerings in honour of S\u00e1riputta, those who practised meditation....... in honour of Maudgaly\u00e1yana, the students of the sutras...... in honour of Purnamaitr\u00e1yaniputra, the followers of the Vinaya..... in honour of Up\u00e1li, the bhikkhunis..... in honour of Ananda, the Sr\u00e1maneras.... in honour of R\u00e1hula and followers of the Great Vehicle.... in honour of bodhisattvas (Watters, pp. 302, 303; The Life, p. 77).</p><p>After Mathura he visited Matipuram (Ma-ti-pu-lo) which was ruled by a king of the S\u00fadra caste. He makes reference to Gunaprabha the author of Tattvavibhanga S\u00e1stra and to a learned doctor called Sanghabbadra who was versed in the Vibh\u00e1s\u00e1 of the Sarvistiv\u00e1da school and who composed the Kosa-k\u00e1rik\u00e1. Ht. stayed there for a few months and studied various texts under", "the eminent monk called Mitrasena.</p><p>On his way to Kapitha (Kis-pi-tha) also called Sankassa he had to go past Brahmapura (P'o-lo-hih-mo-pu-lo), Ahikshetra ('O-hi-shi-to-lo) and Vir\u00e1sana (Pi-to-shanna). Proceeding two hundred li towards north-west from Kapitha he reached Kanauj or K\u00e1nyakubja (Kie-jo-kio-she-kwo). Its capital borders on the Ganges on the West. </p><p>Watters argues that the direction shown in the text is wrong and it should be South East. He also argues that the river in question is not the Ganges but a tributary of that river (Waiters, p. 340; cp. also Records, Bk. V. p. 207.</p><p> </p><p>It was a busy centre of Buddhism and there were ten thousand monks who studied both vehicles very ardently. His account on Harsavardhana or Harsha also called Sil\u00e1ditya is of immense historical value.</p><p>Countries from Ayodhy\u00e1 (O-yo-t'o) to Hiranya parvata (I-lam-na-po-fa-to) constitute another phase of his long pilgrimage. Six hundred li to the south-east from Kanauj is Ayodhya. Several thousand monks there studied both vehicles, and it is here that Vasubandhu and Asanga carried out their literary activities. When Ht. and his companions were going from Ayodhya to Hayamukha ('O-ye-mu-khi) along the course of the Ganges a gang of pirates took the crew captive. As worshippers of goddess Durga the pirates were looking out for a man of good form and comely features for sacrificing to the goddess. They earmarked Ht. as the most suitable person for the purpose and were about to kill him. Suddenly a typhoon arose smiting down the trees. Clouds of sand flew on every side and the lashing waves of the river tossed the boats to and fro. The pirates getting terrified at the calamity thought that it all happened due to the spiritual power of Ht, and came down in repentance and confessed their fault.</p>", "<p>After this nasty experience Ht. went to Hayamukha and from there to Pray\u00e1ga (Po-lo-ye-kia). He describes Pray\u00e1ga, the confluence of two rivers, Gang\u00e1 and Yamun\u00e1 and the level ground of about fourteen li in circuit, to the West. From Pray\u00e1ga he set out for Kausambi (Kiau-shang-mi) where he saw many sangh\u00e1ramas, st\u00fapas and a sandalwood image of the Buddha fashioned by king Udayana. According to Ht, there were about three thousand monks belonging to the Sammitiya school of the Little Vehicle in the Kingdom of Vis\u00e1kha (Pi-so-kia).</p><p>In Sr\u00e1vasti, the next important Buddhist centre he visited, there were several hundred sangh\u00e1r\u00e1mas belonging to the Sammitiya school. Sites connected with various incidents are described: for instance, the spot on which Angulim\u00e1la gave up his evil acts and was converted, the convent where Brahmac\u00e1ri heretics killed a woman and accused the Buddha of her murder, the venue in which the Buddha defeated all the heretics, the place where the Buddha met his father, king Suddhodana, for the first time since Enlightenment and so on.</p><p>From Sr\u00e1vasti he went to Kapilavastu (Kie-pi-lo-fa-sutu) where the capital as well as some thousand villages were in a state of ruin. There he saw old foundations of the main palace of Suddhodana and the sleeping quarters of Queen M\u00e1y\u00e1 etc. Hs\u00faan-tsang's account of Kapilavastu and Kusinagara (Kushi-na-kie-lo) or Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1 is replete with accounts of the life of the Buddha before and after his Enlightenment, for example the place of his birth, prophetic pronouncement, sites of the Four Signs, Parinirv\u00e1na etc. According to Ht. the contemporary tradition has it that the Buddha's Nirvina' took place on the fifteenth day of the latter half of the month of Vais\u00e1kha. The Sarv\u00e1stiv\u00e1dins held that it took place during the second half of the month of K\u00e1rtika i.e. November.</p>", "<p>Referring to the kingdom of Banaras or B\u00e1r\u00e1nasi (Po-lo-ni-sse) he speaks of two schools of monks, one belonging to the Sarv\u00e1stiv\u00e1da and the other to the Sammitiya school both belonging to the Little Vehicle. Important sites such as the venue of the Buddha's first sermon and his washing tank are mentioned in his account.</p><p>From B\u00e1r\u00e1nasi he went to Ghazipur (Chen-chu) and then to Vais\u00e1li. There the capital city was in a state of devastation and ruin. The inhabitants at the time of his visit were very few in number. In a sangh\u00e1r\u00e1ma there the Buddha is said to have recited the Vimalakirti Sutra. Three important places relating to his Parinirvana are also mentioned.</p><p>On his way to Magadha (Mo-kie-to) he stopped at the town of Svetapura where he obtained the s\u00fatra called the Bodhisattva-pitaka. He had a high esteem for the people of Magadha. According to him there were about ten thousand monks mostly belonging to the Great Vehicle in Magadha. The capital of Magadha was desolate and in ruins. According to Ht. Asoka held a convocation of a thousand monks at a monastery called Kukkut\u00e1r\u00e1ma. This is an allusion to the Third Council held under the patronage of King Asoka. The monastery in question is named as Asok\u00e1r\u00e1ma in the Dipavamsa and the Mah\u00e1vamsa, the two ancient Pali chronicles of Sri Lanka.</p><p>Referring to Naira\u00f1j\u00e1na and other important sites at Bodhgay\u00e1 he mentions various beliefs regarding the Vajr\u00e1sana. One such belief holds that the site of the Vajr\u00e1sana was the centre of the universe. He says that the Bo-tree had been continually cut down and destroyed by the members of the royalty. Elsewhere he refers to one king named Sas\u00e1nka of Karnasuvarna in Eastern India who destroyed the Bo-tree (Records Bk. viii, p. 121). The following account of Ht. regarding the Bo-tree seems interesting in respect of rituals which developed in later times. \"The Bo-tree sheds its leaves", "when the day of the Nirvana approaches and tender leaves begin to grow after this day. Every year on that day kings, ministers and magistrates pour milk on its roots, light lamps, scatter flowers and they go away collecting leaves.</p><p>The account on the N\u00e1land\u00e1 monastery gives some idea about its academic activities, maintenance, academic staff and student population, curriculum and residential quarters. It says that after the \"Nirvana\" of the Buddha an old king of that country called Sakr\u00e1ditya built this convent out of his great attachment for the Buddha. By the time of Ht.'s visit it had been about 700 years since its establishment. Thus its founding dates back to 1st century B.C.</p><p>His purpose of going to N\u00e1land\u00e1 was to learn the principles of the Yoga-sastra, The chief monk Silabhadra admitted Ht. as his disciple. Among the students there were many foreigners. According to Ht. of all the sangh\u00e1r\u00e1mas of India N\u00e1land\u00e1 Monastery was the most remarkable for its grandeur and height. Resident students numbered ten thousand. They studied the teachings of all the eighteen schools and also subjects such as the Vedas, the Hetuvidy\u00e1, Sabdavidy\u00e1, the Cikits\u00e1vidy\u00e1, the works on magic (Atharvaveda) and the S\u00e1nkhya system. There were 1541 scholars who were versed in various branches of study. Within the temple hundred pupils were being arranged every day for preaching and students attended these and participated in discussions without fail.</p><p>As for the source of income of the N\u00e1land\u00e1 monastery Ht. tells us that there was a farm-house belonging to the monastery. The account does not say anything about the way in which the farm was run and how the income accrued to the monastery. There were other sources of income too. According to Ht. the king of the country remitted the revenue of about hundred villages for the endowment of the convent. Two hundred house", "holders in these villages contributed rice, butter and milk daily. Hence students had no complaints to make about their requisites.</p><p>In R\u00e1jagrha he locates many important sites connected with various episodes; for instance, the site of the stupa where Devadatta in conjunction with Aj\u00e1tasatru r\u00e1j\u00e1 let loose the drunken elephant with intent to kill the Buddha. Referring to the Grdhrak\u00fata (Ki-li-to-lo-kiu) it is said that while residing there the Buddha declared the Saddharmapundarika (Fa-hwa), the Mah\u00e1praj\u00f1\u00e1 (Tapan-jo) and numerous other Sutras.</p><p>His account on the First Council held in R\u00e1jagrha is rather misleading. It appears that he has incorporated into it certain details which deal with later councils. According to Ht. the collection of scriptures authorised by the Council came to be called Sthavira collection because K\u00e1syapa (Mah\u00e1 Kassapa) officiated as the president of the assembly. As regards the emergence of the Mah\u00e1sanghika school Ht. informs us that monks who were excluded from the Council held by Mah\u00e1 K\u00e1syapa assembled in R\u00e1jagrha and made a collection of the doctrine in five Pitakas, the Sutra Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the Miscellaneous Pitaka and the Dh\u00e1rani Pitaka. How this assembly got the name Mah\u00e1sanghika is explained as follows: \"As in this assembly there were ordinary persons (Fan-fu) and holy men it was called the Convocation of the Mah\u00e1sanghikas (The Life, p. 117 cp. Dipavamsa, H. Oldenberg, New Delhi, 1982, 5,30).</p><p>Having visited sacred places in the vicinity of N\u00e1land\u00e1 Ht. returned to the N\u00e1land\u00e1 Monastery again and studied several texts such as the Yoga-sastra, the Ny\u00e1y\u00e1nus\u00e1rasastra, the Hin-hiang-tui-fa-ming, the Hetuvidy\u00e1-sastra, the Pr\u00e1nyam\u00fala-sastra-t\u00edk\u00e1 and the Sata-sastra. Although he had studied the Kosa-vibh\u00e1s\u00e1 and the Satpad\u00e1bhidharma-sastra in different parts of Kashmir yet he studied them again", "at N\u00e1land\u00e1 Monastery. He also studied Brahman literary works and a grammatical treatise the author of which is not known. On the task of studying the Buddhist and Brahman texts he spent five years.</p><p>The next country he visited was Hiranyaparvata (I-lanna-po-fa-to) where he stayed for one year and read the Vibh\u00e1s\u00e1 and the Ny\u00e1y\u00e1nus\u00e1ra-sastra etc. From Hiranyaparvata he made his way to the kingdom of Champa where monks followed the Little Vehicle. This country was infested with wild beasts such as the elephant, wolf, rhinoceros and black leopard. Elephants in that country were used for drawing carriages.</p><p>Countries between Champa (Chen-po) and Samatata (San-to-ch'a) form another phase of his long journey. He visited Hiranya, Kajughira (Ki-shu-ko-kie-lo), Pundravardhana (Pu-na-fa-tan-na) Karnasuvarna (Kielo-na-su-fala-na) before arriving at Samatata. Monks in Pundravardhana belonged to both vehicles whereas those in Karnasuvarna belong to the Little Vehicle of the Sammitiya school. Monks in Karnasurvarna did not use either butter or milk in keeping with the traditional teachings of Devadatta. Immediately after his account on Samatata he refers to Pegu and Siam which, however, lay outside his itinerary.</p><p>Countries included in his itinerary in the East and South-east of India were T\u00e1mralipti (Tan-mo-li-ti), Orissa, Kalinga (Kie-ling-kia), Southern Kosala (Kiao-sa-lo), Andhra (An-to-lo), Dhanakataka (To-na-kie-tse-kia) and Chulya. All these countries had centres of Buddhism. He refers to an entrepot called Caritra (Chi-li-ta-lo) situated on the South-eastern frontier of Orissa.</p><p>Dhanakataka, according to Ht. was once a reputed centre of learning, and learned men used to come and dwell there but at the time of his visit it was entirely desolate.</p><p>The Kingdom of Chulya may be identified", "with the Cola Kingdom. He locates the Chulya Kingdom outside the Dravida country. What made him follow this description is not clear. The Cola Kingdom formed part of the Dravida country through the ages.</p><p>The next place he visited was the Kingdom of Dravida. The territory occupied by Dravida people could have consisted of several kingdoms or countries, but Ht. refers to it as forming one kingdom. However, the capital of that kingdom is named Kanchipura, the birth place of Dharmap\u00e1la Bodhisattva.</p><p>Whilst in Kanchipura Ht. met some three hundred monks from Sinhala. They informed him of the unsettled situation prevailing in Sri Lanka at the time. This dissuaded him from going there. His purpose of going to Sinhala was to get the Tripitaka explained according to the Sthavira school there and also to study the Yoga S\u00e1stra.</p><p>Malak\u00fata was the next important place he visited. He refers to Malayagiri which was well-known for sandalwood and the karp\u00fara scented tree. After Malak\u00fata (Mole-kiu-ch'a) he refers to Sinhala again. According to Ht. Sinhala was originally called Po-chu as it had many gems of a rare character. As for the origin of the Sinhala he narrates with slight variations the legend which traced the origin to a lion king and the murder of the lion by his son. According to Ht. it was the son of the lion who arrived in Po-chu and not his grandson Vijaya as recorded in Sri Lankan chronicles. A second theory about the origin of the Sinhala is narrated as follows: \"But it is also said that Sinhala is the name of a merchant's son, who...... came to Po-chu island and slew the Rakshasas and established his capital in the country.</p><p>With regard to the teachings prevailing in Sri Lanka he adds that monks there follow the teachings of the Great Vehicle and they belong to the school of the sthaviras. He also refers to the schism", "which resulted in the division of the Sangha into two factions, the Mah\u00e1viharav\u00e1sins who were opposed to the Great Vehicle and the Abhayagiriv\u00e1sins who studied both vehicles. His reference to a mountain named Lank\u00e1giri may be the Samantak\u00fata (Adam's Peak) and it was on that mountain the Tath\u00e1gata delivered the Lank\u00e1vat\u00e1ra Sutra according to Ht.</p><p>Going two thousand li from Dravida he arrived at Konkanpura (Kin-na-po-lo) and from there to Maharashtra, He tells us that in a vih\u00e1ra at Konkanpura there was a precious head-dress of Prince Siddh\u00e1rtha. With reference to Maharashtra he says that the people of that country were a warlike nation. He cites in evidence the unsuccessful attempt of Sil\u00e1ditya r\u00e1j\u00e1 to subjugate Pulakesin. This king may be identified as Pulakesin II (609-642 A.C) of the Chalukyas of Vatapi in the Bijapur District.</p><p>Among the countries included in his itinerary to the West and North-west of Narmada were Broach (Baroche), M\u00e1lava (Mo-la-po), Br\u00e1hmanapura (K'ie-ch'a), Vallabhi (Fa-la-pi), Anandapura, Sur\u00e1shtra (Lasn-c'ha) Gurjjara (Kiu-che-lo), Ujjayin (U-che-yen-na), Chi-ki-to, Mahesvarapura, Sur\u00e1tha, Atyanabakela (O-tin-p'o-chi-lo) and Langala (Lang-kie-lo). The last country is situated near the Great Sea towards the country of western women. If M\u00e1lavas were the people of Malava or Malwa in Central India as is generally taken the countries named about are not placed in right order. Ujjayini which is the capital of Malwa is named after Surashtra and Gurjjara situated in Gujarat.</p><p>Of all the countries in India, Ht. had a very high opinion of M\u00e1lava and Magadha. He says that people of these two countries had the reputation of loving the study of literature, of honouring virtue, of polite language and refined speech. In M\u00e1lava there were twenty thousand monks studying the teaching of the Sammitiya school of the small", "vehicle.</p><p>We are told that going north-west from Lang\u00e1la he went to Persia (Po-la-sse) which, lay outside India. It is said that the bowl (patr\u00e1) of the Sakyamuni Buddha was in the royal palace of the country. On its frontier is the city of Ormus (Ho-mo). The countries mentioned next are Babylon? (Fo-lin), an island called the country of the Western women, which is tributary to Fo-lin, Langala, Pitasila (Pi-to-shi-lo), Avanda, Sindh (Sin-tu) M\u00falasth\u00e1napura or Multan (Mu-lo-s'an-po-la) and Parvati.</p><p>If Avanda is to be identified with Avanti in Central India which seems probable in view of his des\u00e7riptions of that country, it is difficult to place Avanda on the route followed from Langala to Multan.</p><p>The country called Parvata was noted for renowned scholars. Ht. stayed there for two years and studied the M\u00fal\u00e1bhidharma-sastra, the Saddharma-samparigrahas\u00e1stra and the Prasiks\u00e1satya-s\u00e1stra as preserved in the Sammitiya school.</p><p>From Parvata he returned south-eastwardly to Magadha and from there to the N\u00e1land\u00e1 Monastery. There was in N\u00e1land\u00e1 a renowned monk called Praj\u00f1abhadra who was versed in the Three Pitakas, S\u00e1stras etc. Ht. remained there for two years and had his doubts cleared through discussions. He spent two more years studying several branches of study under a renowned lay scholar named Jayasena.</p><p>He is said to have been apprised of the time for his return journey in a dream by Maitreya Bodhisattva. However, he was delayed due to unavoidable circumstances. In the meantime, Silabhadra, the master of sastras at N\u00e1land\u00e1 deputed Ht. to expound to the congregation there the Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na-samparigraha-sastra and to comment on the difficult points of the Vidy\u00e1-m\u00e1tra-siddhi-sastra.</p><p>About this time Simharasmi and Ht. held two different views about the principles of Yoga. Ht. proved more competent in", "the encounter and composed a sastra in three thousand slokas resolving the controversy. This work was later approved for study. At this time further disputes took place between the adherents of the two vehicles.</p><p>Monks in Orissa belittled the Great Vehicle and were used to calling it \"Sky Flowers\". But the king of that country had a high regard for the Great Vehicle and challenged the authority of the critics. Monks thereupon requested the king to hold a conference at which they would settle the issue. The controversy does not appear to have taken place at a conference as expected but it came to an end with the compilation of a book which was written by Ht. in refutation of the heretical views held by the monks of Orissa. The way he refuted heretical views made his fame so widespread that king Kum\u00e1rar\u00e1ja of Karnasuvarna in Eastern India longed to have him as his spiritual head in his kingdom. When Ht. showed his reluctance for the third time the king turned furious and even went to the extent of threatening that he would destroy the whole of N\u00e1land\u00e1 Monastery in case his request was turned down. Although at last Ht, complied with the request of the king, Sil\u00e1ditya r\u00e1ja's intervention enabled him to get out of another embarrassing situation.</p><p>Sil\u00e1ditya r\u00e1ja on his part made arrangements to hold a conference for the exposition of the Great Vehicle and to refute the views of the followers of the Little Vehicle. Princes of eighteen countries were invited to participate in the conference. Renowned Buddhist monks, celebrated Brahmans, heretics, non-believers and secular persons attended the conference. For five days Ht. extolled the teachings of the Great Vehicle and no opponent had any opportunity to assert his views. Adherents of the Little Vehicle learning that their school was shattered plotted to kill him. The king,", "however, threatened to behead any one who made an attempt on the life of Ht. It is said that, at the end, large multitudes forsook the Little Vehicle and embraced the Great-Vehicle. When the conference was over Ht. made up his mind to go back to his country. But on a request made to him by Sil\u00e1ditya to witness the quinquennial distribution called 'Mah\u00e1 moksa parisad' he had to postpone for ten days his return journey.</p><p>For his return journey Ht. chose to follow the northern route in order to keep the pledge made by him to the king of Kan-chang that he would visit him on his way back. Getting out from the city of Pray\u00e1ga he took the route which lay across Kausambi, Jalandhara, Simhapura, Taksasil\u00e1 and the river Indus. The boat laden with ola manuscripts and flower seeds capsized in the Indus and fifty manuscript copies and flower seeds were lost. From there he went past Lamghan (Lan-po), Varna, Avakan, the snowy mountains, Kunduz (Hwoh), Tukhara, Kuran, Bolor and Kashgar up to Khotan.</p><p>Of these countries Kashgar and Khotan were renowned centres of the Great Vehicle. Whilst in Khotan he states that he accomplished a journey of more than 50,000 li. His journey through various kingdoms took seventeen years. Here he faced the problem of transporting his books, images and such articles and sent a messenger to Kau-chang asking for help. Seven or eight months later transport facilities were arranged.</p><p>Among the books he brought were 224 sutras and 192 s\u00e1stras of the Great Vehicle; 15 works of the same categories belonging to the Sammitiya School; 22 books of the same belonging to the Mahis\u00e1saka school; 67 books.... of the Sthavirav\u00e1din school; 17 works.... of the K\u00e1syapiya school; 42 works..... of the Dharmagupta school; 36 copies of the Hetuvidy\u00e1 S\u00e1stra; 13 copies of the Sabdavidy\u00e1 sastra. Altogether there were 520", "copies comprising 657 volumes carried upon twenty horses.</p><p>Then he set upon the gigantic task of translating these books into Chinese. For carrying out this project he retired to the monastery of Hong-fu in Si-gan-fu. He completed the translation of 74 distinct works having 1335 chapters. He had moreover made a vast number of pictures and wrote with his own hands copies of various sutras. When all these works had been finished he closed his eyes and lay perfectly still. \"Having recited some verses in adoration of Maitreya, he gradually sank until the day of his demise on the 10th March, the 13th day of the year 664.\"</p><p>Hs\u00faan-tsang's travel accounts which appear in the foregoing description furnish information on a wide variety of subjects. Some of these such as physical barriers, the relative distribution of the centres of the Little and the Great Vehicle in and outside India, Buddhist monuments, hospitality shown in different countries, conferences, religious encounters have been surveyed in brief in the above account. Apart from these he presents a wealth of information on a wide range of subjects such as economic, educational and social conditions, religious practices, mannerism, customs administration and so on. He enumerates a number of ways of showing respect and paying homage that was prevalent among the people of India. Some such forms are</p><ul>  <li>  <p>(i) greeting with a kind of enquiry;  </li>  <li>  <p>(ii) reverently bowing the head;  </li>  <li>  <p>(iii) raising the hands to the head   with an inclination of the body; </li>  <li>  <p>(iv) bowing with hands folded on the   chest; </li>  <li>  <p>(v) bending a knee; </li>  <li>  <p>(vi) kneeling down; </li>", "<li>  <p>(vii) going down on the ground on   hands and knees; </li>  <li>  <p>(viii) bowing down with knees, elbows   and forehead to the ground and </li>  <li>  <p>(ix) prostrating oneself on the   ground.</li></ul><p>Regarding the general education meant for Indians he describes that children in the beginning followed the 'Twelve Chapters' and at the age of seven they began to study the great treatises of the 'Five Sciences'. Some idea of Buddhist education may be gained from his description of N\u00e1land\u00e1 referred to earlier, But his estimation of the Brahmanic system of educating beginners is very high. Regarding the Brahmanic teachers he says: \"These teachers explain the general meaning and teach them minutely, they rouse them to activity and skilfully win them over to progress, they instruct the inert and sharpen the dull. When disciples intelligent and acute are addicted to idle shirking the teachers doggedly persevere repeating instruction until their training is finished.....\"</p><p>Ht. states that differences among various schools of Buddhism were seen in their tenets and also in customs. According to Ht. different schools had their own tenets, and controversies ran high. As a result each of the eighteen schools claimed that each system was intellectually superior to others. Tenets of the Great and the Little systems differed widely. Certain concessions and gains were accorded to monks in keeping with their knowledge and where the spiritual attainments were high the distinctions conferred were extraordinary.</p><p>Referring to the three robes allowed for monks as their costume he narrates that different schools adhered to different styles having broad or narrow fringes and small or large folds. Ht.'s description about wearing sangh\u00e1ti (seng-kio-ki) conforms to the present day", "practice of its wearing by monks in Sri Lanka and other Therav\u00e1da countries. As for the antarav\u00e1sa, (ni-po-so-na) the undergarment, he says that it was worn without a belt. Rather it was made into plaits and then secured by one of these plaits.</p><p> </p><p>Regarding social organisation Ht. informs us that society consists of four caste groups. These four castes form classes of various degrees of ceremonial purity. The members of a caste marry within the caste. Relatives whether by the father's or mother's side do not intermarry and a woman never contracts a second marriage.</p><p>Speaking about the character of the Indian people he tells us that they were of hasty and irresolute temperament but of pure moral principles. They fear retribution for sins in future lives and take lightly their plight in the present life. They keep their sworn obligations.</p><p>His account on law and punishment too, is interesting. According to him the offenders who violate statute law were imprisoned for life. For offences against social morality, disloyalty and unfilial conduct the punishment was mutilation or banishment of the offender out of the country or into the wilderness. Other offences can be atoned for by paying a fine. He also describes the four ordeals by which the innocence or guilt of an accused person is determined.</p><p>For offences against the Vinaya, the community of brethren has a gradation of penalties. If the offence was slight a reprimand was ordered and the punishment became harsh according to the gravity of the offence. Expulsion from the community was the worst punishment meted out to the most serious offender.</p><p>As for the disposal of the dead and the performance of the last rites, there were three recognised customs. The first of these was cremation. The second was water burial, the corpse being put into a", "stream to float and dissolve. The third was burial in the wilderness, the body being cast away in the woods to be eaten up by wild animals.</p><p>The Buddhist brethren were forbidden to wail aloud over a departed one. On the death of a parent they read a service of gratitude to secure for the deceased person bliss in the next life.</p><p>If we are to depend on the records left by Ht. certain kings of the Gupta dynasty have patronised Buddhism. According to him Purugupta Vikrama Prak\u00e1s\u00e1ditya, a brother of Skandagupta, Narasimhagupta Bal\u00e1ditya, son and successor of Purugupta, Tath\u00e1gatar\u00e1ja Vainyagupta, another son of Purugupta and Vajira, a son of Narasimhagupta Bal\u00e1ditya patronised Buddhism. All these kings contributed to the promotion of Buddhist learning by building monastic establishments at N\u00e1land\u00e1.</p><p>According to Ht. the worship of relics was widely practised in many Buddhist countries traversed by him and among these the most popular was the cult of the Tooth Relic of the Buddha. It was prevalent in Bhaktra; in an unnamed temple of a small valley situated to the east of the snowy mountain; Kashmir and Simbala. The next popular Buddhist cult was that of the Bowl-relic.</p><p>Purusapura, the capital of Gandh\u00e1ra as well as Persia are mentioned as countries where the Bowl-relic was venerated. The following objects too were venerated: the sweeping brush made of kusa grass in Bhaktra, the skull-bone at Hidda (Kilo of Fa-hsien) in Nagarahara (Jelalabad), the eye ball, the sangh\u00e1ti robe, and the staff at the same site and the garment washing stone obtained in Udy\u00e1na. A strong tradition about the Buddha presenting pieces of his nails and some hair to two merchants who offered him honey and rice cake is recorded by Ht. with regard to Bhaktra (The Life p.50). This is evidently based on the account in the Vinays Mah\u00e1vagga where two merchants play", "a similar role at Bodh Gaya though no reference is made there to the presentation of nails to them.</p><p>On his way to India he passed through countries where Buddhism did not have adherents. Two such countries were Kan-chang and Sa-mo-kien. He succeeded in propagating Buddhism in those countries by delivering effective sermons. In the latter some devotees were so taken up with the teachings that they even entered the Buddhist Order. It was partly due to his evangelist endeavours that Buddhism which lay dormant after the age of the Guptas began to flourish during the reign of Harshavardhana. </p><p>(<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/images/hsuen_tsang.jpg\">Picture of </a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/images/hsuen_tsang.jpg\">Hiuen Tsiang</a>).</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Haliddir\u00e1ga J\u00e1taka (No. 435)</h2>  </li></ul><p>The story is very similar to that of the Culla-N\u00e1rada J\u00e1taka (q.v.).
