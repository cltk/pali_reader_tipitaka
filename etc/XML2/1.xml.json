But it was probably an important centre even earlier, and Vijitapura, wrested from the Tamils by Dutthag\u00e1man\u00ed, was probably near by (See Codrington, op. cit., 20). Sena I. first made Pulatthipura the capital (Cv.l.9, 46, 85), though even before his time it seems to have been used as a royal residence - e.g., by Aggabodhi IV. (Cv.xlvi.34), Aggabodhi VII.

The successors of Sena I. found in Pulatthipura a certain amount of protection from the inroads of the Colas and the P\u00e1ndiyans; but in the time of Sena V. the town fell into the hands of the Damilas, through the treachery of Sena's mother and his commander in chief, Sena. But Sena V. recovered the city by making a treaty with his commander in chief (Ibid., liv.64, 68). About 1017 A.C. the Colas overran the country, captured Pulatthipura, and made the reigning king, Mahinda V., their prisoner. He died, after twelve years, as a prisoner in India (Ibid.,lv.22ff).

Finally, a young prince named Kitti, born about 1039 A.C., assumed the title of Vijayab\u00e1hu and determined to rescue Pulatthipura. His first attempts failed, partly owing to rebellion among his own people; but finally, civil war broke out in the Cola country itself, and thus, about 1070, he captured Pulatthipura after a great deal of fierce fighting both on sea and land. But, owing to dissensions among his subjects, it was only several years later that he was able to hold his coronation (Cv.lvii.66; lviii.22 ff.; lix.6 ff). He renamed the city Vijayar\u00e1japura, and erected there many religious buildings, chief among which was the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Ibid.,lx.2ff). It was not, however, till the time of Parakkamab\u00e1hu I. that Palatthipura reached the pinnacle of its greatness. He enlarged it to the size of four g\u00e1vutas in length and seven in width and called it Parakkamapura. The city had three suburbs   R\u00e1vjaves\u00edbhujanga, R\u00e1jakulantaka and Vijita -  and fourteen gates. Parakkama adorned it with various parks, chief of which were the Nandanavana and the D\u00edpuyy\u00e1na, and with ponds and numerous buildings, both secular and religious (for details see chiefly Cv.lxxiii.1ff.; lxxviii.44 ff). Kittinissanka added a stone temple for the Tooth Relic (Ibid., lxxx.19). In the reign of L\u00edlavat\u00ed, Lokissara captured the city and ruled there for nine months. He was ousted by the general Parakkama, and later Parakkamapandu ruled as king, till he was deposed about 1215 A.C. by M\u00e1gha of the Kalinga race, who, coming with a large host of Keralas and Malabars, captured the city and mercilessly", "plundered its possessions (Ibid., lxxxiii.15 ff).

Pilinda was his personal name, Vaccha being that of his family. He became a recluse and learnt the C\u00fala Gandh\u00e1ra vijj\u00e1, but, when the Buddha appeared, the charm refused to work. Having heard that the Mah\u00e1 Gandh\u00e1ra prevented the working of the C\u00fala Gandh\u00e1ra and having concluded that the Buddha knew the former, he entered the Order at the Buddha's suggestion, in order to acquire it. The Buddha gave him exercises in meditation, and he became an arahant.</p><p>Certain devas who had been born in the deva world as a result of Pilinda's guidance in a former birth, out of gratitude, waited on him morning and evening. He thus became famous as being dear to the devas, and was declared by the Buddha to be chief among such monks (A.i.24).</p><p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, he was a rich householder of Hamsavat\u00ed and wished to become a monk beloved of the devas. In the time of Sumedh\u00e1 Buddha be was born in the world of men and paid great honour to the Buddha's Th\u00fapa. In a later existence he was a cakkavatti, named Varuna, and established his subjects in righteousness, so that after death they were born in heaven (ThagA.i.51f).</p><p>Pilinda had a habit of addressing everyone as Vasala (outcaste). When this was reported to the Buddha he explained that this was because Pilinda had, for one hundred lives, been born among Vasalav\u00e1d\u00ed-Brahmins (Ud.iii.6; DhA.iv.181f). One day, on entering R\u00e1jagaha, Pilinda met a man carrying a bowl of pipphal\u00ed (long pepper). \u201cWhat's in thy bowl, Vasala?\" he asked, and the man, in anger, said, \u201cThe dung of mice.\" \"So be it,\" said Pilinda, and the pepper turned into dung. The man was horrified, and, seeking Pilinda,", "persuaded him to right the matter (AA.i.154f).</p><p>The Vinaya Pitaka mentions that on several different occasions Pilinda suffered from various ailments and the Buddha had to give permission for the provision of suitable remedies. Vin.i.204f.; some hold (e.g., Brethren 14, n. 4) that the Thera of R\u00e1jagaha, mentioned in the following stories, was distinct from the Thera of S\u00e1vatthi. See below.</p><p>Once Bimbis\u00e1ra found Pilinda, clearing a cave in order to provide a cell for himself. The king promised to build a monastery for him if he could obtain the Buddha's sanction. The permission was obtained and was reported to the king, but he forgot the matter until one hundred days later. On remembering, he made ample amends, gave Pilinda five hundred attendants to look after the monastery, and granted for their maintenance a village, which came to be called Ar\u00e1mikag\u00e1ma or Pilindag\u00e1ma. One day, while in the village for alms, Pilinda went into a house where a girl was weeping because the day was a feast day and she had no ornament to wear, her parents being too poor to afford any. Pilinda gave her a roll of grass to put round her head and it turned instantly into solid gold. The king's officers, hearing of this wreath, suspected the family of theft and cast them into prison. The next day Pilinda, discovering what had happened, visited the king and convinced him of his iddhi powers by turning the whole palace into gold. The family was released, and the king and his courtiers gave to Pilinda large quantities of the five medicaments, all of which Pilinda distributed among those who wished for them. Vin.i.206 ff.; iii.248ff. This was the occasion for the forming of the rule that all medicaments required by a monk should be used within seven days. It was in reference to this that the Gandh\u00e1ra J\u00e1taka (J.iii.363 ff.) was preached. The", "incident of the palace being turned into gold is referred to at Kvu.608.</p><p>Another story is related of Pilinda's iddhi powers (Vin.iii.67). Once a family of Benares, which was wont to minister to Pilinda, was attacked by robbers and two girls were kidnapped. Pilinda, by his iddhi power caused them to be brought back, and the monks complained of this to the Buddha, but the Buddha held that no wrong had been done. The Apad\u00e1na (i.59f.; 302 16) has two sets of verses ascribed to Pilinda, the second very much longer than the first, thus supporting the view mentioned earlier, that there were two Theras named Pilindavaccha. In any event, there has evidently been a confusion of legends, and it is no longer possible to separate them. It is the first set of Apad\u00e1na verses which is quoted in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 Commentary (Loc. cit.). In the second set we are told that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Pilinda was a very wealthy dov\u00e1rika. He took many precious gifts to Ananda, Padumuttara's father, and won from him a boon. He asked, as his boon, that he should be allowed to entertain the Buddha. The king refused to grant this, but the dov\u00e1rika appealed to the judges and they gave the verdict in his favour. Thereupon he held a great almsgiving of unparalleled splendour for seven days and gave away all manner of gifts. As a result he was born one thousand times as king of the devas and one thousand times also as king of men. In his last birth he suffered from neither heat nor cold, dust did not adhere to his body, and the rain did not wet him.</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Puradeva</h2>  </li></ul><p>A god, evidently the tutelary deity of Anur\u00e1dhapura.</p><p>There was a shrine erected to him within the precincts of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra.

MA.ii.979 ff. Cp. the story of Tissa, king of Roruva (ThagA.i.199f.)</p><p>He had been the king of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')\">Takkasil\u00e1</a>, contemporary of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')\">Bimbis\u00e1ra</a> and of about the same age. A friendly alliance was established between the two kings through the medium of merchants who travelled between the two countries for purposes of trade. In the course of time, although the two kings had never seen each other, there grew up between them a deep bond of affection. Pukkus\u00e1ti once sent to Bimbis\u00e1ra, as a gift, eight priceless garments in", "lacquered caskets. This gift was accepted at a special meeting of the whole court, and Bimbis\u00e1ra having nothing of a material nature, which he considered precious enough to send to Pukkus\u00e1ti, conceived the idea of acquainting Pukkus\u00e1ti with the appearance in the world of the Three Jewels (ratan\u00e1ni) the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. He had inscribed on a golden plate, four cubits long and a span in breadth, descriptions of these Three Jewels and of various tenets of the Buddha's teachings, such as the satipatth\u00e1n\u00e1, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Thirty seven factors of Enlightenment. This plate was placed in the innermost of several caskets of various precious substances, and was taken in procession on the back of the state elephant up to the frontier of Bimbisira's kingdom. Similar honours were paid to it by the chiefs of other territories, through which lay the route to Takkasil\u00e1.  </p><p>When Pukkus\u00e1ti, in the solitude of his chamber, read the inscription on the plate, he was filled with boundless joy and decided to renounce the world. He cut off his hair, donned the yellow robes of a monk, and left the palace alone amid the lamentations of his subjects. He travelled the one hundred and ninety two leagues to <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')\">S\u00e1vatthi</a>, passing the gates of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')\">Jetavana</a>; but having understood from Bimbis\u00e1ra's letter that the Buddha was at R\u00e1jagaha, he omitted to enquire for him at Jetavana, and travelled on forty five leagues more to R\u00e1jagaha, only to find that the Buddha was all the time in S\u00e1vatthi. As it was then evening, he took lodging in Bhaggava's house. The Buddha, with his divine eye, saw what was in store for Pukkus\u00e1ti, and travelling on foot from S\u00e1vatthi, reached Bhaggava's house at sundown, and, waiting his opportunity, engaged Pukkus\u00e1ti in talk and preached to", "him the Dh\u00e1tuvibhanga Sutta, as related above.

He wore the garb of an ascetic, but his heart was not in the ascetic life, and, when a N\u00e1ga maiden tried to seduce him, he easily succumbed. Their children were S\u00e1gara Brahmadatta and Samuddaj\u00e1. When the king of Benares died, Brahmadatta returned with his children to the kingdom and his N\u00e1ga wife returned to the N\u00e1ga world. While playing about in a lake specially prepared for them, the children of Brahmadatta discovered a tortoise, Cittac\u00fala, and were much frightened. Cittac\u00fala was brought before the king and was ordered to be cast into the Yamun\u00e1, that being the direst penalty the king could envisage. Caught in a whirlpool, Cittac\u00fala was carried to the realm of the N\u00e1gaking Dhatarattha, and, when questioned, had the presence of mind to say that he had been sent from Benares to propose a marriage between Dhatarattha and Samuddaj\u00e1. N\u00e1ga messengers were sent to the Benares court to make arrangements, and they laid their proposal before the king. Cittac\u00fala had meanwhile spirited himself away. Brahmadatta was horrified at the proposals of the messengers, and did not fail to say so, whereupon Dhatarattha was so incensed at the insult offered to him that he laid siege to Benares with his N\u00e1ga hosts. To avert the total destruction of the city, Samuddaj\u00e1 was given to Dhatarattha, with whom she dwelt for a long time without discovering that she was in the N\u00e1ga world, everyone, at the king's orders, having assumed human form. Samuddaj\u00e1 had four children   Sudassana, Datta, Subhaga and Arittha (K\u00e1n\u00e1rittha) -  and one step daughter, Accimukh\u00ed. Datta, who was the Bodhisatta, used to visit Vir\u00fapakkha, the ruler of the N\u00e1ga hosts, and one day went with him to pay homage to Sakka. In the", "assembly a question arose which only Datta could answer, and Sakka was so pleased with him that he gave him the name of Bh\u00faridatta (wise Datta). Anxious to be born in Sakka's company, Bh\u00faridatta took the vows and observed the fast, lying on the top of an ant hill. At the end of the fast, N\u00e1ga maidens would come and take him back.</p><p>One day a brahmin villager and his son, Somadatta, went hunting in the forest and spent the night on a banyan tree near where Bh\u00faridatta lay. At dawn, these two saw the N\u00e1ga maidens come for Bh\u00faridatta and witnessed their song and dance, which Bh\u00faridatta, having laid aside his snake form, much enjoyed. Discovering the presence of the villagers, Bh\u00faridatta entered into conversation with them, and invited them to the N\u00e1ga world, where they passed a whole year, enjoying great luxury. Owing to lack of merit, the villagers grew discontented and wished to return to the world of men on the pretext that they wished to become ascetics. Bh\u00faridatta offered them a wish conferring jewel, but this they refused, saying that they had no use for it. Once in the world of men, Somadatta and his father took off their ornaments to bathe, but these divine ornaments disappeared to the N\u00e1ga world.</p><p>Some time later, while father and son were wandering about in the forest, having returned from stalking deer, they met a brahmin called <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalambaayana')\">Alamb\u00e1yana</a>, who possessed a N\u00e1ga jewel. He was a poor man of Benares who had fled into the forest to escape his creditors. There he had met an ascetic, Kosiya, to whom a Garuda king had taught the \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana spell which was potent to tame N\u00e1gas. The Garuda had torn up a banyan tree, which shaded the ascetic's walk. A N\u00e1ga, which the Garuda had seized, coiled itself round the tree, but the Garuda carried the tree with the N\u00e1ga on it. When he discovered that he had done", "the ascetic an injury in pulling up the tree, he felt repentant and taught the ascetic the \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana spell by way of atonement. The ascetic, in turn, taught it to the poor brahmin, hoping it would help him. The brahmin, now called \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana, left the ascetic and, while wandering about, came across some N\u00e1gas, carrying Bh\u00faridatta's jewel. They heard him recite the spell and fled in terror, leaving behind them the jewel, which he picked up.</p><p>When Somadatta and his father met the brahmin, they saw the jewel, and the father schemed to steal it. He told \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana of the difficulties connected with guarding the jewel and of how dangerous it might prove, if not duly honoured. If \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana would give him the jewel, he would show him the abode of Bh\u00faridatta, whom the brahmin might then capture, making money with his help. When Somadatta realized his father's treachery, he rebuked him and fled from him. \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana went with the villager and captured Bh\u00faridatta and crushed his bones. Having thus rendered the N\u00e1ga helpless. \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana put him in a basket and travelled about making him dance before large audiences The jewel, which \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana gave to the treacherous villager, slipped from the later's hand and returned to the N\u00e1ga world.</p><p>On the day of the capture of Bh\u00faridatta, his mother had a terrifying dream, and later, when Bh\u00faridatta had been absent for a month, she grew very anxious and lamented piteously. A search was instituted - K\u00e1n\u00e1rittha was sent to the deva world, Subhaga to Himav\u00e1, Sudassana and Accimukh\u00ed to the world of men. Sudassana went disguised as an ascetic, and Accimukh\u00ed, assuming the form of a frog, hid in his matted hair. They found \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana making ready to give an exhibition of Bh\u00faridatta's dancing before the king of Benares. Sudassana took up his stand at the edge of the crowd, and Bh\u00faridatta, seeing", "him, went up to him. The crowd retreated in fear. When Bh\u00faridatta was back in his basket, Sudassana challenged \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana to prove that his magic powers were greater than those of Sudassana. This challenge was accepted, and Sudassana called out to Accimukh\u00ed who, uttering the frog's cry, stood on his shoulder, and having spat drops of poison on to his palm, went back into his hair. Saying that the country would be destroyed if the poison fell on the earth, Sudassana had three holes dug, and filled the first with drugs, the second with cow dung, and the third with heavenly medicines. He poured the poison into the first hole; a flame instantly burst out, spread to the second, and, having travelled on to the third, consumed all the medicines and was extinguished. \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana was standing near the last hole: the heat of the poison smote him, the colour of his skin changed, and he became a leper. Filled with terror, he set the N\u00e1ga free. Bh\u00faridatta assumed a radiant form decked with all ornaments; so did Sudassana and Accimukh\u00ed. The king, on discovering that they were the children of Samuddaj\u00e1, rejoiced greatly and entertained them. Bh\u00faridatta returned to the N\u00e1ga world, the king accompanying him. The king stayed there for some days and then returned to his kingdom.</p><p>Subhaga, in the course of his wanderings, came across Somadatta's father, and, on discovering that it was he who had betrayed Bh\u00faridatta, snatched him away into the N\u00e1ga world, after first nearly drowning him in the whirlpools of the Yamun\u00e1. K\u00e1n\u00e1rittha, who was guarding the entrance to the room where Bh\u00faridatta lay ill and tired after his experiences, protested against Subhaga's ill treatment of a brahmin, and described the greatness of the brahmins and the importance of holding sacrifices and of learning the Vedas. The N\u00e1gas, who were listening, were greatly impressed, and Bh\u00faridatta, seeing them", "in danger of accepting false doctrine, sent for K\u00e1n\u00e1rittha, confuted his arguments, and converted the N\u00e1gas to the right view. Some time after, Bh\u00faridatta, with his retinue, and followed by Dhatarattha, Samuddaj\u00e1, and their other children, visited his grandfather Brahmadatta, who had become an ascetic. There they met S\u00e1gara Brahmadatta, now king of Benares, and great was the rejoicing over their reunion. Samuddaj\u00e1 then returned with her family to the N\u00e1ga world, where they lived happily to the end of their days.</p><p>The story was related in reference to some laymen of S\u00e1vatthi who kept the fast diligently.</p><p>Devadatta is identified with \u00c1lamb\u00e1yana, Ananda with Somadatta, Uppalavann\u00e1 with Accimukh\u00ed, S\u00e1riputta with Sudassana, Moggall\u00e1na with Subhaga, and Sunakkhatta with K\u00e1n\u00e1rittha (J.vi.157 219).</p><p>The story of Bh\u00faridatta is found also in the Cariy\u00e1pitaka (Cyp.ii.2) as the Bh\u00faridatta cariy\u00e1, to illustrate S\u00edlap\u00e1ramit\u00e1.

The Buddha was five years older than Bimbis\u00e1ra, and it was not until fifteen years after his accession that Bimbis\u00e1ra heard the Buddha preach and was converted by him. It is said (Mhv.ii.25ff.; Dpv.iii.50ff ) that the two were friends in their youth owing to the friendship which existed between their fathers. Bimbis\u00e1ra's father was called Bh\u00e1ti (MT.137; Dpv.iii.52); according to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, op. cit., 16) he was called Mah\u00e1paduma and his Mother Bimb\u00ed.</p><p>But according to the Pabbaj\u00e1 Sutta (SN.vs.405ff.; also J.i.66 and DhA.i.85; also Rockhill, p. 27) the first meeting between the Buddha and Bimbis\u00e1ra took place in R\u00e1jagaha under the Pandavapabbata, only after the Buddha's Renunciation. The king, seeing the young ascetic pass below the palace windows, sent messengers after him. On learning, that he was resting after his meal, Bimbis\u00e1ra followed him and offered him a place in his court. This the Buddha refused, revealing his identity. The Commentary adds (SNA.ii.386) that Bimbis\u00e1ra wished him success in his quest and asked him to visit first R\u00e1jagaha as soon as he had attained Enlightenment. It was in fulfilment of this promise that the Buddha visited R\u00e1jagaha immediately after his conversion of the Tebh\u00e1tika Jatil\u00e1. He stayed at the Supatittha cetiya in Latthivanuyy\u00e1na, whither Bimbis\u00e1ra, accompanied by twelve nahutas of householders, went to pay to him his respects. The Buddha preached to them, and eleven nahutas, with Bimbis\u00e1ra at their head, became sot\u00e1pannas. On the following day the Buddha and hiss large retinue of monks accepted the hospitality of Bimbis\u00e1ra. Sakka, in the guise of a", "young man, preceded them to the palace, singing songs of glory of the Buddha. At the conclusion of the meal, Bimbis\u00e1ra poured water from a golden jar on the Buddha's hand and dedicated Veluvana for the use of him and of his monks (Vin.i.35ff). </p><p>It was this gift of Veluvana, which formed the model for Dev\u00e1nampiyatissa's gift of the Mah\u00e1meghavana to Mahinda (Mhv.xv.17). The gift of Veluvana was one of the incidents sculptured in the Relic chamber of the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa (Mhv.xxx.80). It may have been in Veluvana that the king built for the monks a storeyed house, fully plastered (Vin.ii.154). With the attainment of sop\u00e1tatti, the king declared that all the five ambitions of his life had been fulfilled: that he might become king, that the Buddha might visit his realm, that he might wait on the Buddha, that the Buddha might teach him the doctrine, that he might understand it (Vin.i.36). According to BuA. (p. 18f.) the king became a Sot\u00e1panna after listening to the Mah\u00e1-N\u00e1rada J\u00e1taka.</p><p>From this moment up till the time of his death, a period of thirty seven years, Bimbis\u00e1ra did all in his power to help on the new religion and to further its growth. He set an example to his subjects in the practice of the precepts by taking the uposatha vows on six days, of each month (PvA.209).</p><p>Bimbis\u00e1ra's chief queen was Kosaladev\u00ed (q.v.), daughter of Mah\u00e1kosala and sister of Pasenadi. On the day of her marriage she received, as part of her dowry, a village in K\u00e1si, for her bath money. Her son was Aj\u00e1tasattu (also J.iii.121). Bimbis\u00e1ra had other wives as well; Khem\u00e1, who, at first, would not even visit the Buddha till enticed by Bimbis\u00e1ra's descriptions of the beauties of Veluvana; and the courtesan Padumavat\u00ed, who was brought from Ujjen\u00ed, with the help of a Yakkha, so that R\u00e1jagaha might not lack a Nagarasobhin\u00ed. Both", "these later became nuns. Padumavat\u00ed's son was Abhaya. Bimbis\u00e1ra had another son by Ambap\u00e1l\u00ed, known as Vimala Konda\u00f1\u00f1a, and two others, by different wives, known as S\u00edlava and Jayasena. A daughter, Cundi, is also mentioned.</p><p>Bimbis\u00e1ra's death, according to the Commentaries, was a sad one (E.g., DA.i.135 ff.; see also Vin.ii.190f). Soothsayers had predicted, before the birth of Aj\u00e1tasattu, that he would bring about the death of his father, for which reason his mother had wished to bring about an abortion. But Bimbis\u00e1ra would not hear of this, and when the boy was born, treated him with the greatest affection (for details see Aj\u00e1tasattu). When the prince came of age, Devadatta, by an exhibition of his iddhi-power, won him over to his side and persuaded him to encompass the death of his father, Bimbis\u00e1ra's patronage of the Buddha being the greatest obstacle in the path of Devadatta. The plot was discovered, and Bimbis\u00e1ra's ministers advised him to kill Aj\u00e1tasattu, Devadatta and their associates. But Bimbis\u00e1ra sent for Aj\u00e1tasattu and, on hearing that he desired power, abdicated in his favour. Devadatta chided Aj\u00e1tasattu for a fool. \"You are like a man who puts a skin over a drum in which is a rat,\" and he urged on Aj\u00e1tasattu the need for the destruction of Bimbis\u00e1ra.</p><p>But no weapon could injure Bimbis\u00e1ra (probably because he was a Sot\u00e1panna, he also had the power of judging the status of anyone by his voice \u2013 e.g., in the case of Kumbhaghosa, DhA.i.233), it was therefore decided that he should be starved to death, and with this end in view he was imprisoned in a hot house (t\u00e1panageha) with orders that none but the mother of Aj\u00e1tasattu should visit him. On her visits she took with her a golden vessel filled with food which she concealed in her clothes. When this was discovered she took food in her head dress (mol\u00ed), and, later, she was obliged to take what food she", "could conceal in her footgear. But all these ways were discovered, and then the queen visited Bimbis\u00e1ra after having bathed in scented water and smeared her person with catumadhura (the four kinds of sweets). The king licked her person and that was his only sustenance. In the end the visits of the queen were forbidden; but the king continued to live by walking about his cell meditating. Aj\u00e1tasattu, hearing of this, sent barbers to cut open his feet, fill the wounds with salt and vinegar, and burn them with coals. It is said that when the barbers appeared Bimbis\u00e1ra thought his son had relented and had sent them to shave him and cut his hair. But on learning their real purpose, he showed not the least resentment and let them do their work, much against their will. (In a previous birth he had walked about in the courtyard of a cetiya with shoes on, hence this punishment!) Soon after, Bimbis\u00e1ra died, and was reborn in the C\u00e1tummah\u00e1r\u00e1jika world as a Yakkha named Janavasabbha, in the retinue of Vessavana. The Janavasabha Sutta records an account of a visit paid by Janavasabha to the Buddha some time after.</p><p>A son was born to Aj\u00e1tasattu on the day of Bimbis\u00e1ra's death. The joy be experienced at the birth of his son made him realize something of the affection his own father must have felt for him, and he questioned his mother. She told him stories of his childhood, and he repented, rather belatedly, of his folly and cruelty. Soon after, his mother died of grief, and her death gave rise to the protracted war between Aj\u00e1tasattu and Pasenadi, as mentioned elsewhere (J.ii.237, 403).</p><p>The books contain no mention of any special sermons preached by the Buddha to Bimbis\u00e1ra nor of any questions asked by him of the Buddha.  </p><p>When he heard that the Buddha intended to perform a miracle, although he had ordered his disciples to refrain from doing so,", "Bimbis\u00e1ra had doubts about the propriety of this and questioned the Buddha who set his doubts at rest (DhA.iii.204; J.iii.263f.). It was also at the request of Bimbis\u00e1ra that the Buddha established the custom of the monks assembling on the first, eighth, fourteenth and fifteenth days of each month (Vin.i.101f.).</p><p>Perhaps, like An\u00e1thapindika, his equal in devotion to the Buddha, he refrained from giving the Buddha extra trouble, or perhaps the affairs of his kingdom, which was three hundred leagues in extent, did not permit him enough leisure for frequent visits to the Buddha. (DhA.iii.205; the kingdom included eighty thousand villages, g\u00e1ma, Vin.i.179).</p><p>It is said that he once visited four monks -  Godhika, Sub\u00e1hu, Valliya and Uttiya -  and invited them to spend the rainy season at R\u00e1jagaha. He built for them four huts, but forgot to have them roofed, with the result that the gods withheld the rains until the king remembered the omission (ThagA.i.125). He similarly forgot his promise to give Pilindavaccha a park keeper, if the Buddha would sanction such a gift. Five hundred days later he remembered his promise and to make amends, gave five hundred park keepers with a special village for their residence, called \u00c1r\u00e1mikag\u00e1ma or Pilindag\u00e1ma (Vin.i.207f.).</p><p>Bimbis\u00e1ra's affection for the Buddha was unbounded. When the Licchavis sent Mah\u00e1li, who was a member of Bimbis\u00e1ra's retinue, to beg the Buddha to visit Ves\u00e1li, Bimbis\u00e1ra did not himself try to persuade the Buddha to do so, but when the Buddha agreed to go he repaired the whole road from R\u00e1jagaha to the Ganges -  a distance of five leagues - for the Buddha to walk upon; he erected a rest house at the end of each league, and spread flowers of five different colours knee deep along the whole way. Two parasols were provided for the Buddha and one for each monk. The king himself", "accompanied the Buddha in order to look after him, offering him flowers and perfume and all requisites throughout the journey, which lasted five days. Arrived at the river, he fastened two boats together decked with flowers and jewels and followed the Buddha's boat into the water up to his neck. When the Buddha had gone, the king set up an encampment on the river bank, awaiting his return; he then escorted him back to R\u00e1jagaha with similar pomp and ceremony (DhA.iii.438 ff).</p><p>Great cordiality existed between Bimbis\u00e1ra and Pasenadi. They were connected by marriage, each having married a sister of the other. Pasenadi once visited Bimbis\u00e1ra in order to obtain from him a person of unbounded wealth (amitabhoga) for his kingdom. Bimbis\u00e1ra had five such -  Jotiya, Jatila, Mendaka, Punnaka and K\u00e1kavaliya; but Pasenadi had none. The request was granted, and Mendaka's son, Dhana\u00f1jaya, was sent back to Kosala with Pasenadi (DhA.i.385f.; AA.i.220). Some of these were richer than Bimbis\u00e1ra-  e.g., Jotiya (q.v.), whose house was built entirely of jewels while the king's palace was of wood; but the king showed no jealousy (DhA.iv.211).</p><p>Bimbis\u00e1ra also maintained friendly relations with other kings, such as Pukkas\u00e1ti, king of Takkasil\u00e1, Candappajjota, king of Ujjen\u00ed, to whom he sent his own physician J\u00edvaka to tend in his illness -  and Rudr\u00e1yana of Roruka (Dvy.545).</p><p>Among the ministers and personal retinue of Bimbis\u00e1ra are mentioned Sona-Kolvisa, the flower gatherer Sumana who supplied the king with eight measures of jasmine flowers, the minister Koliya, the treasurer Kumbbaghosaka and his physician J\u00edvaka. The last named was discovered for him by the prince Abhaya when he was suffering from a fistula. The king's garments were stained with blood and his queens mocked him. J\u00edvaka cured the king with one single anointing; the king offered him the ornaments of", "the five hundred women of the palace, and when he refused to take these, he was appointed physician to the king, the women of the seraglio and the fraternity of monks under the Buddha (Vin.i.272f).</p><p>When Dhammadinn\u00e1 wished to leave the world, Bimbis\u00e1ra gave her, at her husband's request, a golden palanquin and allowed her to go round the city in procession (MA.i.516).</p><p>Bimbis\u00e1ra is generally referred to as Seniya Bimbis\u00e1ra. The Commentaries explain Seniya as meaning \"possessed of a large following\" or as \"belonging to the Seniyagotta,\" and Bimbis\u00e1ra as meaning \"of a golden colour,\" bimb\u00ed meaning gold (e.g., UdA.104). According to Tibetan sources, Bimb\u00ed was the name of his mother, and from this his own name was derived; but another reason was that he was radiant like the morning sun (Rockhill 16,  See also MA.i.292).</p><p>In the time of Phussa Buddha, when the Buddha's three step brothers, sons of King Jayasena, obtained their father's leave to entertain the Buddha for three months, Bimbis\u00e1ra, then head of a certain district, looked after all the arrangements. His associates in this task were born as petas, and he gave alms to the Buddha in their name in order to relieve their sufferings.</p><p>See Tirokudda Sutta, also PvA.21ff.; for his intercession on behalf of another pets. see PvA.89.</p><p>During his lifetime, Bimbis\u00e1ra was considered the happiest of men, but the Buddha declared (e.g., M.i.95) that he himself was far happier than the king.</p><p>The kah\u00e1pana in use in R\u00e1jagaha during Bimbis\u00e1ra's time was the standard of money adopted by the Buddha in the formation of those rules into which the matter of money entered (Sp.ii.297).</p><p>Bimbis\u00e1ra had a white banner and one of his epithets was Pandaraketu (Thag.vs.64; ThagA.i.147).

One day he met a monk, named Revata, and on being defeated by him in controversy, entered the Order to learn the Buddha's teachings. Because his speech was profound, like that of the Buddha, and because his words spread throughout the world (like those of the Buddha), he came to be called Buddhaghosa. While dwelling with Revata, he wrote the \u00d1\u00e1nodaya and the Atthas\u00e1lin\u00ed, and also began to write a Parittatthakath\u00e1 (a concise commentary) on the Tipitakas. In order to complete his task, he came over to Ceylon at the suggestion of Revata (S\u00e1s.p.29, says he was sent to Ceylon as punishment for thinking himself wiser than his teachers) and studied the Singhalese Commentaries at the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra, under Sanghap\u00e1la. When his studies were ended he wrote the Visuddhimagga, and having thereby won the approval of the Elders of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra, he rendered the Singhalese Commentaries into P\u00e1li. During this period he lived in the Ganth\u00e1karavih\u00e1ra, and on the accomplishment of his task he returned to Jambud\u00edpa.

Rebirth in the Brahma world is the result of great virtue accompanied by meditation (Vsm.415). The Brahmas, like the other celestials, are not necessarily sot\u00e1panna or on the way to complete knowledge (sambodhi-par\u00e1yan\u00e1); their attainments depend on the degree of their faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. See, e.g., A.iv.76f.; it is not necessary to be a follower of the Buddha for one to be born in the Brahma world; the names of six teachers are given whose followers were born in that world as a result of listening to their teaching (A.iii.371ff.; iv.135ff.). </p><p>The J\u00e1takas contain numerous accounts of ascetics who practised meditation, being born after death in the Brahma world (e.g., J.ii.43, 69, 90; v.98, etc.).

When the rest of the world is destroyed at the end of a kappa, the Brahma world is saved (Vsm.415; KhpA.121), and the first beings to be born on earth come from the \u00c1bhassara Brahma world (Vsm.417). Buddhas and their more eminent disciples often visit the Brahma worlds and preach to the inhabitants. E.g., M.i.326 f.; ThagA.ii.184ff.; Sikh\u00ed Buddha and Abhibh\u00fa are also said to have visited the Brahma world (A.i.227f.). The Buddha could visit it both in his mind made body and his physical body (S.v.282f.). </p><p>If a rock as big as the gable of a house were to be dropped from the lowest Brahma-world it would take four months to reach the earth travelling one hundred thousand leagues a day.

When the Buddha hesitates to preach his doctrine, because of its profundity, it is Sahampati (q.v.) who visits him and begs him to preach it for the welfare of the world. The explanation given (e.g., at SA.i.155) is that the Buddha waited for the invitation of Sahampati that it might lend weight to his teaching. The people were followers of Brahm\u00e1, and Sahampati's acceptance of the Buddha's leadership would impress them deeply. </p><p>Sahampat\u00ed is mentioned as visiting the Buddha several times subsequently, illuminating Jetavana with the effulgence of his body. It is said that with a single finger he could illuminate a whole Cakkav\u00e1la (SA.i.158). Sanankum\u00e1ra (q.v.) was also a follower of the Buddha. The Brahm\u00e1s appear to have been in the habit of visiting the deva worlds too, for Sanankum\u00e1ra is reported as being present at an assembly of the T\u00e1vatimsa gods and as speaking there the Buddha's praises and giving an exposition of his teaching. But, in order to do this, he assumed the form of Pa\u00f1casikha (D.ii.211ff).</p><p>The books refer (e.g., at D.i.18, where Brahm\u00e1 is described as vasavatt\u00ed issaro katt\u00e1 nimm\u00e1t\u00e1, etc.) to the view held, at the Buddha's time, of Brahm\u00e1 as the creator of the universe and of union with Brahm\u00e1 as the highest good, only to be attained by prayers and sacrifices. But the Buddha himself did not hold this view amid does not speak of any single Brahm\u00e1 as the highest being in all creation. See, however, A.v.59f., where Mah\u00e1 Brahm\u00e1, is spoken of as the highest denizen of the Sahassalokadh\u00e1tu (y\u00e1vat\u00e1 sahassalokadh\u00e1tu, Mah\u00e1-Brahm\u00e1 tattha aggam akkh\u00e1yati); but he, too, is", "impermanent (Mah\u00e1-Brahm\u00fano pi . . . atthi eva a\u00f1\u00f1athattam, atthi viparin\u00e1mo).</p><p>There are Mah\u00e1 Brahm\u00e1s, mighty and powerful (abhibh\u00fa anabhibh\u00fato a\u00f1\u00f1adatthudaso vasavatt\u00ed), but they too, all of them, and their world are subject to the laws of Kamma. E.g., at S.v.410 (Brahmaloko pi \u00e1vuso anicco adhuvo sakk\u00e1yapariy\u00e1panno s\u00e1dh\u00e1yasm\u00e1 Brahmalok\u00e1 cittam vutth\u00e1petv\u00e1 sakk\u00e1yanirodhacittam upasamhar\u00e1hi). See also A.iv.76f., 104f., where Sunetta, in spite of all his great powers as Mah\u00e1 Brahm\u00e1, etc., had to confess himself still subject to suffering. </p><p>To the Buddha, union with Brahm\u00e1 seems to have meant being associated with him in his world, and this can only be attained by cultivation of those qualities possessed by the Brahm\u00e1. But the highest good lay beyond, in the attainment of Nibb\u00e1na. Thus in the Tevijj\u00e1 Sutta; see also M.ii.194f.</p><p>The word Brahma is often used in compounds meaning highest and best -  e.g., Brahmacariy\u00e1, Brahmassara; for details see Brahma in the New P\u00e1li Dictionary.</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": ["<ul>  <li>  <h2>Bandhula</h2>  </li></ul><p>Son of a chieftain of the <b>Mallas</b> in <b>Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1</b>.

He leapt up in the air and smote them with his sword, but on discovering the treachery of his kinsmen, he threatened to kill them all; his parents, however, dissuaded him, and he went to live in S\u00e1vatthi, where Pasenadi appointed him Sen\u00e1pati. </p><p>Bandhula's wife was <b>Mallik\u00e1</b> (known as <b>Bandhula</b><b>-</b><b>Mallik\u00e1</b> in order to distinguish her from the wife of Pasenadi).

He accepted her, thereby showing his faith in the Buddha. Soon after she conceived a child, and her pregnancy longing was to enter the lotus tank used by the princes of <b>Ves\u00e1li</b> on their coronation and to drink its water. Bandhula took her to Ves\u00e1li, drove away the strong guards who were posted at the lotus tank, and let Mallik\u00e1 enjoy it to her heart's content.

The word may have been used originally only in connection with the last life of a Buddha, in such contexts as \"in the days before my Enlightenment, when as yet I was only a Bodhisatta\u201d. E.g., M.i.17, 114, 163; so also in the Mah\u00e1pad\u00e1na Sutta (D.ii.13) and the Acchariyaabbhutadhamma Sutta (M.iii.119). </p><p>But already in the Kath\u00e1vatthu (e.g., 283 90, 623) the previous lives of Gotama Buddha and other saints had begun to excite interest and speculation.</p><p>In the developed form of the ideas regarding Bodhisattas, a Bodhisatta's career started with his making a resolution before a Buddha (abhin\u00edh\u00e1rakarana or m\u00falapanidh\u00e1na) to become a Buddha for the welfare and liberation of all creatures. In later literature, the abhin\u00edh\u00e1ra is preceded by a period during which the Bodhisatta practises manopanidhi, when he resolves in his mind to desire to become a Buddha without declaring this intention to others.</p><p>For the abhin\u00edh\u00e1ra to be effective, eight conditions should be fulfilled (Bu.ii.59; explained at BuA.75f. and SNA.i.48f): the aspirant should be </p><ul>  <li>(1) a human being, </li>", "<li>(2) a male, </li>  <li>(3) sufficiently developed to become an arahant in that   very birth, </li>  <li>(4) a recluse at the time of the declaration,   </li>  <li>(5) he should declare his resolve before a Buddha,  </li>  <li>(6) should be possessed of attainments such as the   jh\u00e1nas, </li>  <li>(7) be prepared to sacrifice all, even life, and   </li>  <li>(8) his resolution should be absolutely firm and   unwavering. </li></ul><p>In the case of Gotama Buddha, his abhin\u00edh\u00e1ra was made at Amarav\u00e1t\u00ed in the presence of D\u00edpankara Buddha. His name at that time was Sumedha (q.v.). The Buddha, before whom the abhin\u00edh\u00e1ra is made, looks into the future and, if satisfied, declares the fulfilment of the resolve, mentioning the particulars of such fulfilment. This declaration is called vy\u00e1karana, and is made also by all subsequent Buddhas whom the Bodhisatta may meet during his career. Having received his first vy\u00e1karana, the Bodhisatta proceeds to investigate the qualities which should be acquired by him for the purposes of Buddhahood (buddhak\u00e1rakadhamm\u00e1), in accordance with the custom of previous Bodhisattas. These he discovers to be ten in number, the Ten Perfection, (dasap\u00e1rami):</p><ul>  <li>d\u00e1na, </li>  <li>s\u00edla, </li>  <li>nekkhamma, </li>  <li>pa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1, </li>  <li>viriya, </li>  <li>khanti, </li>  <li>sacca, </li>  <li>aditth\u00e1na, </li>  <li>mett\u00e1 and </li>  <li>upekh\u00e1. </li></ul><p>Bu.ii.116ff.

See Kharad\u00e1thika.</p><p>The length of a Bodhisatta's career varies; some practice the p\u00e1ram\u00ed for at least four asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, others for at least eight asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, and yet others for sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas. The first of these periods is the very least that is required and is intended for those who excel in wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1). The middle is for those who excel in faith (saddh\u00e1); and the last and highest for those whose chief feature is perseverance (viriya) (SNA.i.47 f).</p><p>In their penultimate life all Bodhisattas are born in Tusita (see Buddha), where life lasts for fifty seven crores and six million years, but most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing their life span. Vipass\u00ed, e.g., was among the exceptions (DA.ii.427).</p><p>As the time for the announcement of their last birth approaches, all is excitement because of various signs appearing in the ten", "thousand world systems. The devas of all the worlds assemble in Tusita and request the Bodhisatta to seek birth as a human being, that he may become the Buddha. The Bodhisatta withholds his reply until he has made the Five Great Investigations (pa\u00f1camah\u00e1vilokan\u00e1) regarding time, continent, place of birth, his mother and the life span left to her. Buddhas do not appear in the world when men live to more than one hundred thousand years or to less than one hundred. They are born only in Jambud\u00edpa and in the Majjhimadesa, and only of a khattiya or brahmin clan. The Bodhisatta's mother in his last birth must not be passionate or given to drink; she should have practised the p\u00e1rami for one hundred thousand kappas, have kept the precepts inviolate from birth, and should not be destined to live more than ten months and seven days after the conception of the Bodhisatta.</p><p>Having satisfied himself as to these particulars, the Bodhisatta goes with the other devas to Nandanavana in Tusita, where he announces his departure from their midst and disappears from among them while playing. On the day of his conception, the Bodhisatta's mother takes the vows of fasting and celibacy at the conclusion of a great festival, and when she has retired to rest, she dreams that the Four Regent Gods take her with her bed, bathe her in the Anotatta Lake, clad her in divine garments, and place her in a golden palace surrounded by all kinds of luxury. As she lies there the Bodhisatta in the form of a white elephant enters her womb through her right side. The earth trembles and all the ten thousand world systems are filled with radiance. Immediately the Four Regent Gods assume guard over mother and child. Throughout the period of pregnancy, which lasts for ten months; exactly, the mother remains free from ailment and sees the child in her womb sitting crossed legged (like a preacher on a dais, says the Commentary DA.ii.436). At the end of", "the ten months; she gives birth to the child, standing in a grove, never indoors. Suddh\u00e1v\u00e1sa brahmins, free from all passion, first receive the child in a golden net, and from them the Four Regent Gods take him on an antelope skin and present him to his mother. Though the Bodhisatta is born free of the mucous otherwise present at birth, two showers of water -  one hot, the other cold -  fall from the sky and bathe mother and child. The child then takes seven strides to the north, standing firmly on his feet, looks on all sides, and seeing no one anywhere to equal him, announces his supremacy over the whole world and the fact that this is his last birth. (Gotama Buddha as the Bodhisatta, spoke, in three different births, as soon as born -  as Mahosadha, as Vessantara, and in his last birth, J.i.53). </p><p>Seven days after birth his mother dies. She dies because she must bear no other being. The Bodhisatta's time of conception is so calculated that the mother's destined life span completes itself seven days after his birth. From the Commentary (DA.ii.437; UdA.278) account it would appear that the age of the Bodhisatta's mother at the time of his birth is between fifty and sixty (majjhimavayassa pana dve kotth\u00e1s\u00e1 atikkamma tatiyekotth\u00e1se).</p><p>The Bodhisatta's last birth is attended by various miracles. The Commentaries see, in the various incidents connected with the Bodhisatta's last birth, signs of various features, which came, later, to be associated with the Buddha and his doctrine; for details see DA.ii.439ff. </p><p>Soothsayers, being summoned, see on the child's body the thirty two marks of a Great Man (mah\u00e1purisa), (for details of these see D.ii.17ff.; M.ii.136f. The reasons for these marks are given at D.iii.145ff ) and declare that the child will become either a Cakkavatti or a Buddha. His father, desiring that his child shall be a Cakkavatti rather than a Buddha,", "brings him up in great luxury, hiding from him all the sin and ugliness of the world. But the destiny of a Bodhisatta asserts itself, and he becomes aware of the presence in the world of old age, disease, death and the freedom of mind to be found in the life of a Recluse. In the case of some Bodhisattas (e.g., Vipass\u00ed) these four signs (nimitt\u00e1ni as they are called) are seen by them at different times, but in the case of others on one and the same day (DA.ii.457).</p><p>Urged by the desire to discover the cause of suffering in the world and the way out of it, the Bodhisatta leaves the world on the day of his son's birth. </p><ul>  <li>Some Bodhisattas leave the world riding on an elephant   (e.g., D\u00edpankara, Sumana, Sumedha, Phustsa, Sikh\u00ed and Kon\u00e1gamana),   </li>  <li>some on a chariot (e.g., Konda\u00f1\u00f1a, Revata, Paduma,   Piyadass\u00ed, and Kakusandha), </li>  <li>some on a horse (e.g., Mangala, Suj\u00e1ta, Atthadass\u00ed,   Tissa, Gotama), and </li>  <li>some in a palanquin (e.g., Anomadass\u00ed, Siddhattha and   Vessabh\u00fa). </li>  <li>Some, like N\u00e1rada, go on foot, </li>  <li>while Sobhita, Dhammadass\u00ed and Kassapa travelled in the   palaces of their lay life.</li></ul><p>Having left the world, the Bodhisatta practises the austerities, the period of such practices varying. </p><ul>  <li>In the case of D\u00edpankara, Konda\u00f1\u00f1a, Sumana, Anomadass\u00ed,   Suj\u00e1ta, Siddhattha and Kakusandha it was ten months; </li>  <li>for Mangala, Sumedha, Tissa and Sikh\u00ed it was eight;  </li>  <li>for Revata seven; </li>  <li>for Piyadass\u00ed, Phussa, Vessabh\u00fa and Kon\u00e1gamana six;  </li>  <li>for Sobhita four; </li>  <li>for Paduma, Atthadass\u00ed and Vipass\u00ed two weeks;   </li>  <li>for N\u00e1rada, Padumuttara, Dhammadass\u00ed and Kassapa one", "week; </li>  <li>and for Gotama six years (for the reason for this great   length in the last case, see Gotama). </li></ul><p>On the day the Bodhisatta attains to Buddhahood, he receives a meal of milk rice (p\u00e1y\u00e1sa) from a woman and a gift of kusagrass, generally from an \u00c1j\u00edv\u00edka, which he spreads under the Bodhi-tree (the Bodhi tree is different for each Bodhisatta) for his seat. The size of this seat varies;</p><ul>  <li>the seats of D\u00edpankara, Revata, Piyadass\u00ed, Atthadass\u00ed,   Dhammadass\u00ed and Vipass\u00ed were fifty-three hands in   length; </li>  <li>those of Konda\u00f1\u00f1a, Mangala, N\u00e1rada and Sumedha fifty   seven hands; </li>  <li>that of Sumana sixty hands; </li>  <li>those of Sobhita, Anomadass\u00ed, Paduma, Padumuttara and   Phussa thirty eight; </li>  <li>of Suj\u00e1ta thirty two; </li>  <li>of Kakusandha twenty six; </li>  <li>of Kon\u00e1gamana twenty; </li>  <li>of Kassapa fifteen; </li>  <li>of Gotama fourteen (BuA. 247). </li></ul><p>Before the Enlightenment the Bodhisatta has five great dreams: </p><ul>  <li>(1) that the world is his couch with the Him\u00e1laya as   his pillow, his left hand resting on the eastern sea, his right on the   western, and his feet on the southern; </li>  <li>(2) that a blade of tiriy\u00e1(kusa) grass growing from his   navel touches the clouds; </li>  <li>(3) that white worms with black heads creep up from his   feet, covering his knees; </li>  <li>(4) that four birds of varied hues from the four   quarters of the world fall at his feet and become white; </li>  <li>(5) that he walks to and fro on a heap of dung, by   which he remains unsoiled. </li></ul><p>For the explanations of these dreams see A.iii.240f.;", "these dreams are referred to at J.i.69.</p><p>The next day the Bodhisatta sits cross legged on his seat facing the east, determined not to rise till he has attained his goal. The gods of all the worlds assemble to do him honour, but M\u00e1ra (q.v.) comes with his mighty hosts and the gods flee. All day, the fight continues between M\u00e1ra and the Bodhisatta; the p\u00e1rami alone are present to lend their aid to the Bodhisatta, and when the moment comes, the Goddess of the Earth bears witness to his great sacrifices, while M\u00e1ra and his armies retire discomfited at the hour of sunset, the gods then returning and singing a paean of victory. Meanwhile the Bodhisatta spends the night in deep concentration; during the first watch he requires knowledge of past lives, during the second watch he develops the divine eye, while during the last watch he ponders over and comprehends the Paticca-samupp\u00e1da doctrine. Backwards and forwards his mind travels over the chain of causation and twelve times the earth trembles. With sunrise, omniscience dawns on him, and he becomes the Supremely Awakened Buddha, uttering his ud\u00e1n\u00e1 of victory, while the whole world rejoices with him. </p><p>For the Paticca-Samuppada see D.ii.31ff.; for the other details see J.i.56ff., where the story of Gotama is given.

In addition to these, particulars of the personal career of the Bodhisatta who became Gotama, are found, chiefly in the Buddhavamsa and the J\u00e1takatthakath\u00e1. It has already been stated that each Bodhisatta receives the vy\u00e1karana from every Buddha whom he meets, and Gotama was no exception. </p><ul>  <li>He received his first vy\u00e1karana as the ascetic Sumedha,", "from D\u00edpankara;

There can appear only one Buddha in the world at a time (D.ii.225; D.iii.114; the reasons for this are given in detail in Mil. 236, and quoted in DA.iii.900f). No Buddha can arise until the s\u00e1sana of the previous Buddha has completely disappeared from the world. This happens only with the dh\u00e1tuparinibb\u00e1na (see below). When a Bodhisatta takes conception in his mother's womb in his last life, after leaving Tusita, there is manifested throughout the world a wonderful radiance, and the ten thousand world systems tremble.</p><p>Similar earthquakes appear when he is born, when he attains Enlightenment, when he preaches the first sermon, when he decides to die, when he finally does so (D.ii.108f.; cp. DA.iii.897).</p><p>The <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadana_s')\">Mah\u00e1p\u00e1d\u00e1na Sutta</a> (D.ii.12-15) and the<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/am/acchariyabbhuta_s')\">Acchariya-bbhuta-dhamma Sutta</a> (M.iii.119-124) contain accounts of other miracles, which attend the conception and birth of a Buddha. Later books (e.g., J.i.) have greatly enlarged these accounts. They describe how the Bodhisatta, having practised the thirty P\u00e1ram\u00ed, and made the five great gifts (pa\u00f1camah\u00e1paricc\u00e1g\u00e1), and thus reached the pinnacle of the threefold cariy\u00e1 -  \u00f1\u00e1tattha-cariy\u00e1, lokattha-cariy\u00e1 and buddhi-cariy\u00e1 -  gives the seven mah\u00e1d\u00e1n\u00e1, as in the case of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara')\">Vessantara</a>, making the earth tremble seven times, and is born after death in Tusita. The Bodhisatta, who later became Vipass\u00ed Buddha, remained in Tusita during the whole permissible period -  fifty seven crores and sixty seven thousand years. But most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing the full span of life there. Five signs appear to warn the devaputta that his", "end is near (see Deva); the gods of the ten thousand worlds gather round him, beseeching him to be born on earth that he may become the Buddha. The Bodhisatta thereupon makes the five investigations (pa\u00f1camah\u00e1vilokan\u00e1ni).</p><p>Sometimes only one Buddha is born in a <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/kappa')\">kappa</a>, such a kappa being called S\u00e1rakappa; sometimes two, Mandakappa; sometimes three, Varakappa; sometimes four, S\u00e1ramandakappa; rarely five, Bhaddakappa (BuA.158f). No Buddha is born in the early period of a kappa, when men live longer than one hundred thousand years and are thus not able to recognize the nature of old age and death, and therefore not able to benefit by his preaching. When the life of man is too short, there is no time for exhortation and men are full of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/kilesa')\">kilesa</a>. The suitable age for a Buddha is, therefore, when men live not less than one hundred years and not more than ten thousand. The Bodhisatta must first consider the continent and the country of birth. Buddhas are born only in <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')\">Jambud\u00edpa</a>, and there, too, only in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ma/majjhimadesa')\">Majjhimadesa</a>. He must then consider the family; Buddhas are born only in brahmin or khattiya families, whichever is more esteemed during that particular age. Then he must think of the mother: she must be wise and virtuous; and her life must be destined to end seven days after the Buddha's birth.</p><p>Having made these decisions, the Bodhisatta goes to <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandanavana')\">Nandanavana</a> in Tusita, and while wandering about there \"falls away\" from Tusita and takes conception. He is aware of his death but unaware of his cuti-citta or dying thought. The Commentators seem to have differed as to whether there is", "awareness of conception. When the Bodhisatta is conceived, his mother has no further wish for indulgence in sexual pleasure. For seven days previously she observes the uposatha vows, but there is no mention of a virgin birth; the birth might be called parthenogenetic (see Mil.123).</p><p>On the day of the actual conception, the mother, having bathed in scented water after the celebration of the As\u00e1lha festival, and having eaten choice food, takes upon herself the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/u_v/uposatha')\">uposatha</a> vows and retires to the adorned state bedchamber. As she sleeps, she dreams that the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')\">Four Regent Gods</a> raise her with her bed, and, having taken her to the Him\u00e1laya, bathe her in Lake Anotatta, robe her in divine clothes, anoint her with perfumes and deck her with heavenly flowers (according to the Nid\u00e1nakath\u00e1, J.i.50, it is their queens who do these things, re the Bodhisatta assuming the form of an elephant, see Dial.ii.116n). Not far away is a silver mountain and on it a golden mansion. There they lay her with her head to the east. The Bodhisatta, assuming the form of a white elephant, enters her room, and after circling right wise three times round her bed, smites her right side with his trunk and enters her womb. She awakes and tells her husband of her dream. Soothsayers are consulted, and they prophesy the birth of a <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti')\">Cakka-vatti</a> or of a Buddha.</p><p>The two suttas mentioned above speak of the circumstances obtaining during the time spent by the child in his mother's womb. It is said (DA.ii.437) that the Bodhisatta is born when his mother is in the last third of her middle age. This is in order that the birth may be easy for both mother and child. Various miracles attend the birth of the Bodhisatta. The Commentaries", "expound, at great length, the accounts of these miracles given in the suttas. Immediately after birth the Bodhisatta stands firmly on his feet, and having taken seven strides to the north, while a white canopy, is held over his head, looks round and utters in fearless voice the lion's roar: \"Aggo 'ham asmi lokassa, jettho 'ham asmi lokassa, settho 'ham asmi lokassa, ayam antim\u00e1 j\u00e1ti, natthi d\u00e1ni punabbhavo\u201d (D.ii.15). </p><p>To the later Buddhists, not only these acts of the Bodhisatta, but every item of the miracles accompanying his birth, have their symbolical meaning. See, e.g., DA.ii.439; thus, standing on the earth means the attaining of the four iddhi-p\u00e1das; facing north implies the spiritual conquest of multitudes; the seven strides are the seven bojjhangas; the canopy is the umbrella of emancipation; looking round means unveiled knowledge; fearlessness denotes the irrevocable turning of the Wheel of the Law; the mention of the last birth, the arahantship he will attain in this life, etc.</p><p>There seems to have been a difference of opinion among the Elders of the Sangha as to what happened when the Bodhisatta took his seven strides northwards. Did he walk on the earth or travel through the air? Did people see him go? Was he clothed? Did he look an infant or an adult? Tipitaka Cul\u00e1bhaya, preaching on the first floor of the Lohap\u00e1s\u00e1da, settled the question by suggesting a compromise: the Bodhisatta walked on earth, but the onlookers felt he was traveling through the air; he was naked, but the onlookers felt he was gaily adorned; he was an infant, but looked sixteen years old; and after his roar he reverted to infancy! (DA.ii.442)</p><p>After birth, the Bodhisatta is presented to the soothsayers for their prognostications and they reassert that two courses alone are open to him   either to be a Cakka-vatti or a Buddha. They also", "discover on his body the thirty two marks of the Great Man (<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapurisa')\">Mah\u00e1purisa</a>) (These are given at D.ii.17 19; also M.ii.136f). The Bodhisatta has also the eighty secondary signs (as\u00edti anubya\u00f1jana) such as copper coloured nails glossy and prominent, sinews which are hidden and without knots, etc. (The list is found in Lal. 121 [106]). The Brahm\u00e1yu Sutta (for details see M.ii.137f) gives other particulars about Gotama, which are evidently characteristic of all Buddhas. Thus, in walking he always starts with the right foot, his steps are neither too long nor too short, only his lower limbs move; when he gazes on anything, he turns right round to do so (n\u00e1gavilokana). When entering a house he never bends his body (Cp. DhA.ii.136); when sitting down, accepting water to wash his bowl, eating, washing his hands after eating, or returning thanks, he sits with the greatest propriety, dignity and thoroughness. When preaching, he neither flatters nor denounces his hearers but merely instructs them, rousing, enlightening and heartening them (M.ii.139). His voice possesses eight qualities: it is frank, clear, melodious, pleasant, full, carrying, deep and resonant; it does not travel beyond his audience (for details concerning his voice see DA.ii.452f.; and MA.ii.771f). A passage in the Anguttara (A.iv.308) says that a Buddha preaches in the eight assemblies -  of nobles, brahmins, householders, recluses, devas of the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')\">C\u00e1tummah\u00e1r\u00e1jika</a> world, and of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')\">T\u00e1vatimsa</a>, of M\u00e1ras and of Brahm\u00e1s. In these assemblies he becomes one of them and their language becomes his.</p><p>The typical career of a Buddha is illustrated in the life of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')\">Gotama</a>. He renounces the world only after the birth of a son. This,", "the Commentary explains (DA.ii.422), is to prevent him from being taken for other than a human being. He sees the four omens before his Renunciation: an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a recluse. Some Buddhas see all four on the same day, others, like <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')\">Vipass\u00ed</a>, at long intervals (DA.ii.457). On the night before the Enlightenment, the Bodhisatta dreams five dreams (A.iii.240). After the Enlightenment the Buddha does not preach till asked to do so by Mah\u00e1 <a href=\"brahmaloka')\">Brahm\u00e1</a>. This is on order that the world may pay greater attention to the Buddha and his teaching (DA.ii.467). A Buddha generally travels from the Bodhi tree to <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')\">Isipatana</a> for his first sermon, through the air, but Gotama went on foot because he wished to meet <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka')\">Upaka</a> on the way (DA.ii.471).</p><p>The Buddha's day is divided into periods, each of which has its distinct duties (DA.i.45f; SNA.i.131f, etc.). He rises early, and having attended to his bodily functions, sits in solitude till the time arrives for the alms round. He then puts on his outer robe and goes for alms, sometimes alone, sometimes with a large following of monks. When he wishes to go alone he keeps the door of his cell shut, which sign is understood by the monks (Ibid., 271). Occasionally he goes long distances for alms, travelling through the air, and then only kh\u00edn\u00e1sav\u00e1 are allowed to accompany him (ThagA.i.65). Sometimes he goes in the ordinary way (pakatiy\u00e1), sometimes accompanied by many miracles. After the meal he returns to his cell; this is the pure bhattakicca.</p><p>Having washed his feet, he would emerge from his cell, talk to the monks and admonish them. To those who ask for subjects of meditation, he would give them according to their temperament. He would then", "retire to his cell and, if he so desire, sleep for a while. After that, he looks around the world with his divine eye, seeking whom he may serve, and would then preach to those who come to him for instruction. In the evening he would bathe, and then, during the first watch, attend to monks seeking his advice. The middle watch is spent with devas and others who visit him to question him. The last watch is divided into three parts: the first part is spent in walking about for exercise and meditation; the second is devoted to sleep; and the third to contemplation, during which those who are capable of benefiting by the Buddha's teaching, through good deeds done by them in the past, come into his vision. Only beings that are veneyy\u00e1 (capable of benefiting by instruction) and who possess upanissaya, appear before the Buddha's divine eye (DA.ii.470).  </p><p>The Buddha gives his visitors permission to ask what they will. This is called Sabba\u00f1\u00f1upav\u00e1rana, and only a Buddha is capable of holding to this promise to answer any question (SNA.i.229). Except during the rains, the Buddha spends his time in wandering from place to place, gladdening men and inciting them to lead the good life. This wandering is called c\u00e1rik\u00e1 and is of two kinds -  turita and aturita. The first is used for a long journey accomplished by him in a very short time, for the benefit of some particular person. Thus Gotama travelled three g\u00e1vutas to meet <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')\">Mah\u00e1 Kassapa</a>, thirty yojanas to see <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavaka')\">Alavaka</a> and <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angulimaala')\">Angulim\u00e1la</a>, forty five yojanas to see <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati')\">Pukus\u00e1ti</a>, etc. In the case of aturita c\u00e1rik\u00e1 progress is slow. The range of a Buddha's c\u00e1rik\u00e1 varies from year to year. Sometimes he would tour the Mah\u00e1mandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes", "the Majjhimamandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes only the Antomandala of six hundred yojanas. A tour of the Mah\u00e1mandala occupies nine months, that of the Majjhimamandala eight, and that of the Antomandala from one to four months. Details of the c\u00e1rik\u00e1 and the reasons for them are given at length in DA.i.240 3. When the Buddha cannot go on a journey himself, he sends his chief disciples (SNA.ii.474). The Buddha announces his intention of undertaking a journey two weeks before he starts, so that the monks may get ready (DhA.ii.167).</p><p>The Buddha is omniscient, not in the sense that he knows everything, but that he could know anything should he so desire (see MNid.178,179; see also MNidA.223; SNA.i.18.). His \u00f1\u00e1\u00f1a is one of the four illimitables (neither can the Buddha's body be measured for purposes of comparison with other bodies, MA.ii.790). He converts people in one of three ways: </p><ul>  <li>by exhibition of miraculous powers (iddhip\u00e1tih\u00e1riya), </li>  <li>by reading their thoughts (\u00e1desan\u00e1p\u00e1tih\u00e1riya), </li>  <li>or teaching them what is beneficial to them according to their character and temperament (anus\u00e1san\u00edp\u00e1tih\u00e1riya). </li></ul><p>It is the last method, which the Buddha most often uses (BuA.81) The Buddha's rivals say that he possesses the power of fascination (\u00e1vattan\u00edm\u00e1y\u00e1); but this is untrue, as sometimes (e.g., in the case of the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')\">Kosambi</a> monks) he cannot make even his own disciples obey him. Some beings, however, can be converted only by a Buddha. They are called buddha veneyy\u00e1 (SNA.i.331). Some are pleased by the Buddha's looks, others by his voice and words, yet others by his austerities, such as the wearing of simple robes, etc.; and finally, those whose standard of judgment is goodness, reflect that he is without a peer (DhA.iii.113f.). </p>", "<p>Though the Buddha's teaching is never really lost on the listener, he sometimes preaches knowing that it will be of no immediate benefit (see, e.g., <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/u/udumbarika_s')\">Udumbarikas\u00edhan\u00e1da Sutta</a>, D.iii.57). It is said that wherever a monk dwells during the Buddha's time, in the vicinity of the Buddha, he would always have ready a special seat for the Buddha because it is possible that the Buddha would pay him a special visit (DA.i.48). Sometimes the Buddha will send a ray of light from his <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')\">Gandhakuti</a> to encourage a monk engaged in meditation and, appearing before him in this ray of light, preach to him. Stanzas so preached are called obh\u00e1sag\u00e1th\u00e1 (SNA.i.16, 265).</p><p>Every Buddha founds an Order; the first p\u00e1timokkhuddesag\u00e1th\u00e1 of every Buddha is the same (DA.ii.479). The attainment of arahantship is always the aim of the Buddha's instruction (DA.iii.732). Beings can obtain the four abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1 only during the lifetime of a Buddha (AA.i.204). A Buddha has ten powers (bal\u00e1ni) which consist of his perfect comprehension in ten fields of knowledge, </p><p>A.v.32f.; M.i.69, etc. At S.ii.27f., ten similar powers are given as consisting of his knowledge of the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/n_r/paticca_samuppaada')\">Paticasamupp\u00e1da</a>. The powers of a disciple are distinct from those of a Buddha (Kvu.228); they are seven (see, e.g., D.iii.283) and physical strength equal to that of one hundred thousand crores of elephants (BuA.37). He alone can digest the food of the devas or food which contains the oj\u00e1 put into it by the devas. No one else can eat with impunity the food which has been set apart for the Buddha (SNA.i.154). Besides these excellences, a Buddha possesses the four assurances (ves\u00e1rajj\u00e1ni, given at M.i.71f)), the eighteen \u00e1venikadhamm\u00e1*, and the sixteen anuttariyas**. </p>", "<blockquote>  <p>*Described at Lal. 183, 343, Buddhaghosa also gives (at   DA.iii.994) a list of eighteen buddhadhamm\u00e1, but they are all concerned with   the absence of duccarita in the case of the Buddha.</p>  <p>**Given by S\u00e1riputta in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sampasadaniya_s')\">Sampas\u00e1d\u00e1niya Sutta</a>   (D.iii.102ff.).</p></blockquote><p>The remembrance of former births a Buddha shares with six classes of purified beings, only in a higher degree. This faculty is possessed in ascending scale by titthiy\u00e1, pakatis\u00e1vak\u00e1, mah\u00e1s\u00e1vak\u00e1, aggas\u00e1vak\u00e1, pacceka buddh\u00e1 and buddh\u00e1 (E.g.,Vsm.411).</p><p>Every Buddha holds a <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s')\">Mah\u00e1samaya</a>, and only a Buddha is capable of preaching a series of suttas to suit the different temperaments of the mighty assembly gathered there (D.ii.255; DA.ii.682f).</p><p>A Buddha is not completely immune from disease (e.g., <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')\">Gotama</a>). Every Buddha has the power of living for one whole kappa,\" but no Buddha does so, his term of life being shortened by reason of climate and the food he takes (DA.ii.413). </p><p>The Commentary explains (DA.ii.554f.) that kappa here means \u00e1yukappa, the full span of a man's life during that particular age. Some, like Mah\u00e1s\u00edva Thera, maintained that if the Buddha could live for ten months, overcoming the pains of death, he could as well continue to live to the end of this Bhaddakappa. But a Buddha does not do so because he wishes to die before his body is overcome by the infirmities of old age.</p><p>No Buddha, however, dies till the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/saasana')\">s\u00e1sana</a> is firmly established (D.iii.122).  There are three parinibb\u00e1n\u00e1 in the case of a Buddha: kilesa parinibb\u00e1na, khandha parinibb\u00e1na and dh\u00e1tu parinibb\u00e1na. The first", "takes place under the Bodhi tree, the second at the moment of the Buddha's death, the third long after (DA.iii.899f.; for the history of Gotama's relics see <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')\">Gotama</a>). Some Buddhas live longer than others; those that are digh\u00e1yuka have only sammukhas\u00e1vak\u00e1 (disciples who hear the Doctrine from the Buddha himself), and at their death their relics are not scattered, only a single th\u00fapa being erected over them (SNA. 194, 195). Short lived Buddhas hold the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/u_v/uposatha')\">uposatha</a> once a fortnight; others (e.g. <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa')\">Kassapa</a> Buddha) may have it once in six months; yet others (e.g. <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')\">Vipass\u00ed</a>) only once in six years (ThagA.i.62).  </p><p>After the Buddha's death, his Doctrine is gradually forgotten. The first Pitaka to be lost is the Abhidhamma, beginning with the Patth\u00e1na and ending with the Dhammasangani. Then, the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya of the Sutta Pitaka, from the eleventh to the first Nip\u00e1ta; next the Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya from the Cakkapeyy\u00e1la to the Oghatarana; then the Majjhima, from the Indriyabh\u00e1van\u00e1 Sutta to the M\u00falapariy\u00e1ya Sutta, and then the D\u00edgha, from the Dasuttara to the Brahmaj\u00e1la. Scattered g\u00e1th\u00e1 like the Sabhiyapucch\u00e1, and the \u00c1lavakapucch\u00e1, last much longer, but they cannot maintain the s\u00e1sana. The last Pitaka to disappear is the Vinaya, the last portion being the m\u00e1tik\u00e1 of the Ubhatovibhanga (VibhA.432).</p><p>When a Buddha dies, his body receives the honours due to a monarch (these are detailed at D.ii.141f). It is said that on the night on which a Buddha attains Enlightenment, and on the night during which he dies, the colour of his skin becomes exceedingly bright (D.ii.134). Here we have the beginning of a legend which later grew into an account of an actual \"transfiguration\" of the Buddha.</p>", "<p>At all times, where a Buddha is present, no other light can shine (SNA.ii.525).</p><p>No Buddha is born during the samvattam\u00e1nakappa, but only during the vivattam\u00e1nakappa (SNA.i.51). A Bodhisatta who excels in pa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1 can attain Buddhahood in four asankheyyas; one who exels in saddh\u00e1, in eight, and one whose viriya is the chief factor, in sixteen (SNA.i.47f). When once a being has become a Bodhisatta there are eighteen conditions from which he is immune (SNA.i.50). The Buddha is referred to under various epithets. The Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya gives one such list. There he is called Samana, Br\u00e1hmana, Vedag\u00fa, Bhisaka, Nimmala, Vimala, \u00d1\u00e1n\u00ed and Vimutta (C.iv. 340). Buddhaghosa gives seven others: Cakkkum\u00e1, Sabbabh\u00fatanukamp\u00ed, Vih\u00e1taka, M\u00e1rasenappamadd\u00ed, Vusitav\u00e1, Vimutto and Angirasa (DA.iii.962f).</p><p>The Buddha generally speaks of himself as Tath\u00e1gata. This term is explained at great length in the Commentaries -  e.g., DA.i.59f. His followers usually address him as Bhagav\u00e1, while others call him by his name (Gotama). In the case of Gotama Buddha, we find him also addressed as Sakka (SN. vs. 345; perhaps the equivalent of S\u00e1kya), Brahma (SN. p.91; SNA.ii.418), Mah\u00e1muni (BuA.38) and Yakkha (M.i.386; also KS.i.262). Countless other epithets occur in the books, especially in the later ones. One very famous formula, used by Buddhists in their ritual, contains nine epithets, the formula being: Bhagav\u00e1 araham samm\u00e1sambuddho, vijj\u00e1caranasampanno, sugato, lokavid\u00fa, anuttaro, purisadammas\u00e1rathi, satth\u00e1 devamanuss\u00e1nam, Buddho Bhagav\u00e1 (these words are analysed and discussed in Vsm. 198 ff). It is maintained (e.g., DA.i.288) that the Buddha's praises are limitless (aparim\u00e1na). One of his most striking characteristics, mentioned over and over again, is his love of quiet. </p><p>E.g., D.i.178f.; he is also fond of solitude (patissall\u00e1na),", "(D.ii.70; A.iv.438f.; S.v.320f., etc.). When he is in retirement it is usually ak\u00e1la for visiting him (D.ii.270). There are also certain accusations, which are brought against a Buddha by his rivals, for this very love of solitude. \"It is said that his insight is ruined by this habit of seclusion. By intercourse with whom does he attain lucidity in wisdom? He is not at his ease in conducting an assembly, not ready in conversation, he is occupied only with the fringe of things. He is like a one eyed cow, walking in a circle\" (D.iii.38).</p><p>In this his disciples followed his example (D.iii.37). The dwelling place of a Buddha is called <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti')\">Gandhakuti</a>. His footprint is called Padacetiya, and this can be seen only when he so desires it. When once he wishes it to be visible, no one can erase it. He can also so will that only one particular person shall see it (DhA.iii.194). It is also said that his power of love is so great that no evil action can show its results in his presence (SNA.ii.475). A Buddha never asks for praise, but if his praises are uttered in his presence he takes no offence (ThagA.ii.42). When the Buddha is seated in some spot, none has the power of going through the air above him (SNA.i.222). He prefers to accept the invitations of poor men to a meal (DhA.ii.135).</p><p>See also <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')\">Gotama</a> and <a href=\"bodhisatta')\">Bodhisatta</a>.

Hearing of the Buddha from his friend, the king of Benares, he sent messengers, including his nephew, to find out about the Buddha and to report to him. But the nephew returned with the news of the Buddha's death, which had taken place before their arrival at Benares. Thereupon, Katthav\u00e1hana, having accepted the Buddha's teaching, engaged in various good deeds and was reborn after death in the K\u00e1m\u00e1vacara deva-world. From there he was born in the family of Pasenadi's chaplain and was the teacher of Pasenadi's boyhood. Unwilling to remain longer in the court, he took leave of the king and lived in the royal park as an ascetic. Then, wishing for greater peace, he retired to an island (antarad\u00edpa) in the Godh\u00e1var\u00ed where the two kings Assaka and Alaka gave him a tract of land, five leagues in extent, the residence of the sages of old. It was from there that he sent his disciples to the Buddha (SNA.575ff.; AA.i.182ff). At that time he was one hundred and twenty years old. B\u00e1var\u00ed was the name of his gotta.

Not waiting to cook, the merchants gave the Buddha some butter and honey in a bowl provided by the Four Regent Gods. At the end of the meal the Buddha talked to them. They accepted the Buddha and the Dhamma as their Refuge (the Dvev\u00e1cikasarana, they thus became the Buddha's first lay disciples; A.i.26), and obtained from the Buddha a few hairs as an object of worship.

It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasil\u00e1 (E.g., J.ii.4; DhA.i.250), but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasil\u00e1 (KhA.198; see also DhA.iii.445, where<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima')\">Sus\u00edma</a>, Sankha's son, goes from Takkasil\u00e1 to Benares for purposes of study). </p><p>From Vera\u00f1j\u00e1 to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct,", "crossing the Ganges at Pay\u00e1gatittha. From Benares the road continued to Ves\u00e1li (Sp.i.201). On the road from Benares to R\u00e1jagaha was Andhakavinda (Vin.i.220). There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbis\u00e1ra sent his own physician, J\u00edvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares (Vin.i.275). The distance from Kosamb\u00ed to Benares was thirty leagues by river (MA.ii.929).</p><p>The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated (E.g., J.iv.377; vi.160; MA.ii.608) to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the J\u00e1takas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kik\u00ed, Dhana\u00f1jaya, Mah\u00e1s\u00edlava, Vissasena, and Samyama. (The SNA. on the Khaggavis\u00e1na Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas). </p><p>The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mah\u00e1govinda Sutta, the foundation of B\u00e1r\u00e1nas\u00ed is attributed to Mah\u00e1govinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu (D.ii.235). The Ceylon Chronicles (MT. 127,129,130) mention the names of others who reigned in Benares-  e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okk\u00e1ka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya J\u00e1taka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandah\u00e1la, Pupphavat\u00ed; in that of the Yuva\u00f1jaya, Rammanagara (J.iv.119f); and in that of the Sankha, Molin\u00ed (J.iv.15). It was", "also called K\u00e1sinagara and K\u00e1sipura (E.g., J.v.54; vi.165; DhA.i.87), being the capital of K\u00e1si. The Bhoj\u00e1j\u00e1niya J\u00e1taka (J.i.178) says that \"all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares.\" In the Brah\u00e1chatta J\u00e1taka (J.iii.116), the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of K\u00e1si by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet B\u00e1r\u00e1nas\u00edggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name (J.ii.403).</p><p>Later, when Aj\u00e1tasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kosala, with the help of the Licchavis, K\u00e1s\u00ed, too, was included in his kingdom. Even in the Buddha's time the city of Benares was wealthy and prosperous and was included in the list of great cities suggested by Ananda as suitable places for the Parinibb\u00e1na of the Buddha (D.ii.146).</p><p>Mention is also made of a B\u00e1n\u00e1ras\u00edsetthi (E.g., DhA.i.412; iii. 87, 365) and a Santh\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1 (Mote Hall), which was then, however, no longer being used so much for the transaction of public business as for public discussions on religious and philosophical questions. E.g., J.iv.74; ascetics who came to the city found lodging for the night in the Potters' Hall (e.g., DhA.i.39). </p><p>Near Benares was a grove of seven sir\u00edsaka trees where the Buddha preached to the N\u00e1ga king Erakapatta (DhA.iii.230), and also the Kemiyambavana where Udena met Ghotamukha (M.ii.158); on the other side of the river was V\u00e1sabhag\u00e1ma, and beyond that another village called Cundatthila (PvA.168).</p><p>The Buddha is several times spoken of as staying in", "Benares, where he preached several sermons (E.g., A.i.110f., 279f.; iii.392ff., 399ff.; S.i.105; v.406; Vin.i.189, 216f., 289) and converted many people including Yasa, whose home was in Benares (Vin.i.15), and his friends Vimala, Sub\u00e1hu, Punnaji and Gavampati, all members of eminent families (Vin.i.19). Isipatana (q.v.) became a monastic centre in the Buddha's time and continued so for long after. From there came twelve thousand monks under the leadership of Dhammasena to be present at the ceremony of the foundation of the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa (Mhv.xxix.31).</p><p>In the past, B\u00e1r\u00e1nas\u00ed was the birthplace of Kassapa Buddha (Bu.xxv.33). In the time of Metteyya Buddha, B\u00e1r\u00e1nas\u00ed will be known as Ketumat\u00ed at the head of eighty four thousand towns. Sankha will be Cakkavatti there, but he will renounce the world and will become an arahant under Metteyya (D.iii.75f). B\u00e1r\u00e1nas\u00ed evidently derives its name from the fact that it lies between the two rivers Barn\u00e1 and Asi (CAGI.499f).</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Bhagu Thera</h2>  </li></ul><p>He was born in a S\u00e1kiyan family, and having left the world with his clansmen <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha')\">Anuruddha</a> and<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kimbila')\">Kimbila</a>, he dwelt in the village of B\u00e1kalona.

Dwelling in the bliss of Nibb\u00e1na, under a tree in a lonely spot, Bhaddiya used to exclaim \"Aho sukham, aho sukham.\" When this was reported to the Buddha, he questioned Bhaddiya, who answered that when he was ruling his principality he was well protected, yet was ever fearful and nervous, whereas now, having renounced all, he was free from all fear (Thag.vss.842-65; UdA.ii.10; Vin.i.183f.; J.i.140).

Though they offered him costly robes and many other luxuries, he refused them all and his fame increased. Because of his bark garment he was known as D\u00e1ruc\u00edriya. In due course he came himself to believe that he had attained arahantship, but a devat\u00e1 (a Suddh\u00e1v\u00e1sa-brahm\u00e1, who had been his fellow celibate in the time of Kassapa Buddha, says the Commentary, see below and also MA.i.340), reading his thoughts and wishing him well, pointed out to him his error and advised him to seek the <a href=\"buddha')\">Buddha</a> at <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')\">S\u00e1vatthi</a>.

B\u00e1hiya followed him thither and begged to be taught something for his salvation. Twice he asked and twice the Buddha refused, saying that it was not the hour for teaching. But B\u00e1hiya insisted, saying that life was uncertain and that the Buddha or he might die. </p><p>The Commentaries say that B\u00e1hiya was excited by his", "meeting with the Buddha and that the Buddha wished to give him time to regain his calm, hence his refusal.

A lotus springs there bringing it into view and if during the kappa thus begun a Buddha will be born, the lotus puts forth flowers, according to the number of Buddhas (DA.ii.412).</p><p>In the case of Gotama Buddha, his Bodhi tree sprang up on the day he was born (DA.ii.425; BuA.248). After his Enlightenment, he spent a whole week in front of it, standing with unblinking eyes, gazing at it with gratitude. A shrine was later erected on the spot where he so stood, and was called the Animisalocana cetiya (q.v.). The spot was used as a shrine even in the lifetime of the Buddha, the only shrine that could be so used. While the Buddha was yet alive, in order that people might make their offerings in the name of the Buddha when he was away on pilgrimage, he sanctioned the planting of a seed from the Bodhi tree in Gay\u00e1 in front of the gateway of Jetavana. For this purpose Moggall\u00e1na took a fruit from a tree at Gay\u00e1 as it dropped from its stalk, before it reached the ground. It was planted in a golden jar by An\u00e1thapindika with great pomp and ceremony. A sapling immediately sprouted forth, fifty cubits high, and in order to consecrate it the Buddha spent one night under it, wrapt in meditation. This tree, because it was planted under the direction of Ananda, came to be known as the Ananda Bodhi (J.iv.228ff).</p><p>According to the Ceylon Chronicles (e.g., Mhv.xv), branches from the Bodhi trees of all the Buddhas born during this kappa were planted in Ceylon on the spot where the sacred Bodhi tree stands today in Anur\u00e1dhapura. The branch of Kakusandha's tree was brought by a nun called Ruc\u00e1nand\u00e1, Konagamana's by Kantak\u00e1nand\u00e1 (or Kanakadatt\u00e1), and Kassapa's by", "Sudhamm\u00e1. Asoka was most diligent in paying homage to the Bodhi tree, and held a festival every year in its honour in the month of Kattika (Mhv.xvii.17). His queen, Tissarakkh\u00e1 was jealous of the Tree, and three years after she became queen (i.e., in the nineteenth year of Asoka's reign), she caused the tree to be killed by means of mandu thorns (Mhv.xx.4f). The tree, however, grew again, and a great monastery was attached to the Bodhimanda. Among those present at the foundation of the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa are mentioned thirty thousand monks, from this Vih\u00e1ra, led by Cittagutta (Mhv.xxix.41).</p><p>Kittisirimegha of Ceylon, contemporary of Samudragupta, erected with the permission of Samudragupta, a Sangh\u00e1r\u00e1ma near the Mah\u00e1bodhi-vih\u00e1ra, chiefly for the use of the Singhalese monks who went to worship the Bodhi tree. The circumstances in connection with the Sangh\u00e1r\u00e1ma are given by Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op. cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself. It was probably here that Buddhaghosa met the Elder Revata who persuaded him to come to Ceylon.</p><p>In the twelfth year of Asoka's reign the right branch of the Bodhi tree was brought by Sanghamitt\u00e1 to Anur\u00e1dhapura and placed by Dev\u00e1n\u00e1mpiyatissa in the Mah\u00e1meghavana. The Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon should detach itself (Mhv.xvii.46f). From Gay\u00e1, the branch was taken to P\u00e1taliputta, thence to T\u00e1malitt\u00ed, where it was placed in a ship and taken to Jambukola, across the sea; finally it arrived at Anur\u00e1dhapura, staying on the way at Tivakka. Those who assisted the king at the ceremony of the planting of the Tree were the nobles of K\u00e1jarag\u00e1ma and of Candanag\u00e1ma and of Tivakka.

Once, at the request of his teacher, he visited the Buddha in the Icch\u00e1nadkala wood and seems to have opened his conversation by reviling the S\u00e1kiyans and calling them menials.

The child had been able to talk as soon as he was born and, because of this devilish trait, had been called Kanha (devil), hence the family name.

This gives the Buddha an opportunity of preaching on the futility of feeling vanity regarding one's caste and on the worth of morality and conduct.</p><p>At the end of the discourse the Buddha walked up and down outside his chamber so that Ambattha might see on his body the thirty-two signs of a great man. Ambattha goes back to Pokkharasadi and reports the whole interview. Pokkharas\u00e1di is greatly incensed, abuses Ambattha and kicks him. Later Pokkharas\u00e1di goes himself to the Buddha and invites him for", "a meal.

Meanwhile Ambasakkhara ordered the guards to shut the city gates earlier than usual.

He had been reborn as a peta, and because of his good deeds he possessed various powers.

Every night he came to see his nephew and encouraged him to go on living, in spite of his impalement, because the peta knew that suffering in hell awaited the thief after death.</p><p>When the man with the lotuses asked the thief's assistance in proving his innocence, he was advised to await the peta's arrival that night and to get his counsel. This the man did, and when, the next day, he was summoned before Ambasakkhara, he cited the peta as witness for his defence. Ambasakkhara agreed to test the truth of the story, and in the night he saw the peta and learnt all that had happened. Greatly marvelling, he offered to", "help the peta in getting rid of his nudity.

She grew up so full of beauty and of grace that many young princes vied with each other for the honour of her hand. Finally, in order to end their strife, they appointed her courtesan. Later she became a devout follower of the Buddha, and building a vih\u00e1ra in her own garden, gave it to him and the Order. This was during the Buddha's last visit to Ves\u00e1li shortly before his death. It is said that when Ambap\u00e1l\u00ed heard of the Buddha's visit to Kotig\u00e1ma near Ves\u00e1li she and her retinue drove out of the city in magnificent chariots to meet him, and, after hearing a discourse, invited him and the monks to a meal the next day.

She refused to give up her invitation for anything in the world. The DA. says that just before Ambap\u00e1l\u00ed's visit to him, the Buddha admonished the monks to be steadfast and mindful, lest they should lose their heads about her (DA.ii.545).</p><p>It was after this meal that Ambap\u00e1l\u00ed gave over her park, the Ambap\u00e1livana, to the Buddha and the Order.

The Buddha stopped here on many occasions during his wanderings, and this was the scene of several Vinaya rules, e.g. against monks digging the ground (Vin.iv.32) and cutting trees (Vin.iv.34), using unfiltered water for building purposes (Vin.iv.48), sleeping in the company of novices (Vin.iv.16), giving new buildings in hand (Vin.ii.172f).</p><p> </p><p>The Chabbaggiy\u00e1 are censured here for a nissaggiya offence (Vin.iii.224).

In the early years of Vang\u00edsa's novitiate he stayed at the shrine with his preceptor, and disaffection arose within him twice, once because of women, the second time because of his tutor's solitary habits (S.i.185-6), and later, again, through pride in his own powers of improvisation (patibh\u00e1na) (S.i.187). Here, again, the Buddha utters the praises of Hatthaka Alavaka, who visits him with a large following, whose fealty has been won (according to Hatthaka) by observing the four characteristics of sympathy (sangahavatth\u00fani) learnt from the Buddha (A.iv.216-20).</p><p> </p><p>Many lay-women and nuns flocked there by day to hear the Buddha preach, but none were there when he preached in the evenings (J.i.160).

Devadatta was, at this time, looking for ways and means of taking revenge on the Buddha, and seeing in the prince a very desirable weapon, he exerted all his strength to win him to his side. Ajatasattu was greatly impressed by Devadatta's powers of iddhi and became his devoted follower (Vin.ii.185; J.i.185-6). He built for him a monastery at Gay\u00e1s\u00edsa and waited upon him morning and evening carrying food for him, sometimes as much as five hundred cartloads in five hundred cooking pans (S.ii.242).</p><p> </p><p>Devadatta incited him to seize the throne, killing his father if necessary. When Bimbis\u00e1ra learnt of the prince's intentions he abdicated in his favour. But Devadatta was not satisfied till Bimbis\u00e1ra, who was one of the Buddha's foremost supporters, was killed. (DA.i.135-7). According to the Sankicca J\u00e1taka (J.v.262ff.) he had killed his father in previous births too.</p><p>Aj\u00e1tasattu helped Devadatta in several of the latter's attempts to kill the Buddha (See Devadatta). In the Sanjiva J\u00e1taka (J. i. <st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID=\"510 f\">510 f</st2:frenchfranctoeuro>.) we are told that in past lives he had associated with the sinful and once lost his life as a result. </p><p>Later he was filled with remorse for these past misdeeds as he confesses himself (D.i.85); but evidently, for very shame, he refrained from visiting the Buddha till he was won over by the", "persuasions of his physician J\u00edvaka Kom\u00e1rabhacca. And when in the end he did go to the Buddha, it was in great fear and trembling; so nervous was he that he imagined conspirators in the very silence surrounding the Buddha where he dwelt in the monastery, in Jivaka's Mango grove at R\u00e1jagaha (D.i.49-50; J.v.262-9. An illustration of this visit is the subject of one of the bas-reliefs on the Barhut Tope; Cunningham, Pl. xvi., fig.36, and p.135). </p><p>It was on the occasion of this visit that the S\u00e1ma\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta was preached. The king admits that he had been to various teachers before, but had failed to find satisfaction in their teachings. It is noteworthy that the Buddha greets the king cordially on his arrival and makes no mention whatever of the king's impiety. Instead, when Aj\u00e1tasattu expresses his repentance at the end of the discourse, the Buddha accepts his confession and lets him off almost too lightly. But after the king had departed the Buddha tells the monks how the king's misdeeds had wrought his undoing both in this world and the next, for if he had not been guilty of them, the Eye of Truth (Sot\u00e1pattimagga, says the Commentary) would have been opened for him on the occasion of this sermon. (D.i.85-6). It is said that from the day of his father's death he could not sleep on account of terrifying dreams, particularly after he had heard of Devadatta's dire fate (J.i.508). He slept after his visit to the Buddha (DA.i.238). </p><p> </p><p>Henceforth the king became a loyal adherent of the Buddha's faith, though, as far as we know, he never waited again either upon the Buddha or upon any member of the Order for the discussion of ethical matters. (But see DA.i.238, where we are told \"tinnam ratan\u00e1nam mah\u00e1sakk\u00e1ram ak\u00e1si\"). He was so full of love and respect for the Buddha that when he heard of Upaka Mandik\u00e1putta having spoken rather impolitely to the", "Buddha, he at once flew into a rage (A.ii.182).</p><p>Sakka said of him that among the puthujjanas he was most possessed of piety (DA.ii.610). When the Buddha died, in the eighth year of Aj\u00e1tasattu reign (Mhv.ii.32), the latter's ministers decided not to tell him the news at once, in case he should die of a broken heart. On the pretext of warding off the evil effects of a dream, they placed him in a vat filled with the four kinds of sweet (catumadhura) and broke the sad news gently to him. He immediately fainted, and it was not till they put him in two other vats and repeated the tidings that he realised their implication (DA.ii.605-6). He forthwith gave himself up to great lamentation and despair, \"like a madman,\" calling to mind the Buddha's various virtues and visiting various places associated in his mind with the Buddha. Later he sent messengers to claim his share of the Buddha's relics, and when he obtained them he prolonged the rites held in their honour till the arahants had to seek Sakka's aid to make the king take the relics away to R\u00e1jagaha, where he erected over them a stone thupa (DA.ii.610). Two months afterwards, when the first Council was held, he gave the undertaking his royal patronage and assisted the monks who took part in it with all his power (Sp.i.10-11; DA.i.8-9).</p><p> </p><p>Several incidents connected with Aj\u00e1tasattu's reign are mentioned in the books.</p><p>Bimbis\u00e1ra had married a sister of Pasenadi, and when he was killed she died of grief.</p><p>The revenue of a K\u00e1s\u00ed village had been given to her by her father, Mah\u00e1kosala, as part of her dowry, but after Bimbis\u00e1ra's murder, Pasenadi refused to continue it. Thereupon Aj\u00e1tasattu declared war on his uncle. Before this, uncle and nephew seem to have been on very friendly terms. Once Aj\u00e1tasattu sent Pasenadi a wonderful piece of foreign", "fabric, sixteen cubits long and eight broad, mounted on a pole to serve as a canopy. This Pasenadi gave to Ananda (M.ii.116). </p><p> </p><p>At first he was victorious in three battles, but, later, he was defeated by Pasenadi, who followed the military advice of an old monk, the Elder Dhanuggahatissa; Aj\u00e1tasattu was taken captive with his army. On giving an undertaking not to resort to violence again, he was released, and to seal the friendship, Pasenadi gave him his daughter Vajir\u00e1 as wife, and the revenue of the disputed village was gifted to her as bath-money (S.i.82-5; J.ii.403-4; Avas. 54-7; J.iv.343f.; DhA.iii.259.).</p><p>Aj\u00e1tasattu evidently took his reverses very unsportingly. (See the Haritam\u00e1ta J\u00e1taka, J.ii.237f.)</p><p>Later, when through the treachery of Pasenadi's minister, D\u00edgha K\u00e1r\u00e1yana, his son Vid\u00fadabha usurped the throne, Pasenadi, finding himself deserted, went towards R\u00e1jagaha to seek Aj\u00e1tasattu\u2019s help, but on the way he died of exposure and Aj\u00e1tasattu gave him burial (See Pasenadi).</p><p> </p><p>About a year before the Buddha's death, Aj\u00e1tasattu sent his chief minister and confidant, the brahmin Vassak\u00e1ra, to the Buddha to intimate to him his desire to make war on the Vajjians and to find out what prediction the Buddha would make regarding his chances of victory. The Buddha informed the brahmin that the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of welfare which they had learnt from him, and that they were therefore invincible (D.ii.72f). The Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya mentions the Buddha as saying that the time would come when the Vajjians would relinquish their strenuous mode of living and that then would come Aj\u00e1tasattu\u2019s chance. (S.ii.268). According to the Jainas, Aj\u00e1tasattu fought with Cedaga, king of Ves\u00e1li, for the possession of an extraordinary elephant (Hoernle on \u00c1jivaka in ERE i.). </p>", "<p> </p><p>This chance came about three years later, for by the treachery of Vassak\u00e1ra, he succeeded in sowing dissension among the leading families of Ves\u00e1li. Having thus weakened them, he swooped down upon the place with an overwhelming force and completely destroyed it (For details see Licchavi). Rumours are mentioned of King Candappajjota making preparations for a war on Aj\u00e1tasattu to avenge the death of his friend Bimbis\u00e1ra, but no mention is made of actual fighting (M.iii.7; MA.ii.853; see also Buddhist India, p.13).</p><p> </p><p>Of the end of Aj\u00e1tasattu\u2019s reign the books mention very little except that he was killed by his son Udaya or Ud\u00e1y\u00edbhadda (Mhv.iv.l), who had been born on the day that Bimbis\u00e1ra died as a result of his tortures (DA.i.137).</p><p>We are told that Aj\u00e1tasattu had feared that his son might kill him and had therefore secretly hoped that Udaya would become a monk (DA.i.153). Aj\u00e1tasattu\u2019s reign lasted thirty-two years (Mhv.ii.31; but see Geiger's Introd. to Mhv. trans. xi ff.; also Samaddar: Glories of Magadha, 17, n. 3; also Vincent Smith: Early History of India, pp. <st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID=\"26 ff\">26 ff</st2:frenchfranctoeuro>.).</p><p>It was he who built the fortress of P\u00e1l\u00e1tiputta, which later became the capital of Magadha.</p><p> </p><p>We do not know what Aj\u00e1tasattu\u2019s real name was. By the Jains he is called Kunika or Konika, which again is probably a nickname (Dial. ii.79, n.1). The title Vedehiputta which always accompanies his name probably means \"son of the Videha lady.\" At the time of Buddhaghosa there seems to have been much confusion about the meaning of this word. According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.139) Vedehi means \"wise.\" There seems to have been another explanation which Buddhaghosa rejects - that Aj\u00e1tasattu was the son of the", "Videha queen. Videhi was probably the maiden, family, or tribal (not personal) name of his mother.  According to a Tibetan authority her personal name was V\u00e1sav\u00ed, and she was called Videhi because she was from Videha (Rockhill, p. 63. In the Pali books he is often referred to as Kosaladev\u00ed). (See also Vedehik\u00e1.)</p><p> </p><p>Two explanations are given of the epithet Aj\u00e1tasattu. According to Buddhaghosa he was so called because the soothsayers predicted his enmity to his father even before his birth, and a story is told of how his mother, at the time of his conception, had a longing to drink blood from Bimbis\u00e1ra\u2019s right hand. The longing was satisfied, but when the queen heard the soothsayer's prediction, she tried, in many ways, to bring about a miscarriage. (DA.i.133ff.; J.iii.121-2) The park where she tried to bring about the miscarriage was called Maddakucchi (SA.i.61). </p><p> </p><p>In this she was prevented by the king. Later both parents grew to be very fond of him. There is a story of the prince, holding his father's finger, visiting Jotika's marvellous palace and thinking that his father was a fool for not taking Jotika's wealth. When he became king he acquired Jotika's palace. (DhA.iv.211 and 222f). As a boy he used to visit the Buddha with his father (DA.i.152).</p><p>To show Bimbis\u00e1ra\u2019s love for the babe, an incident is mentioned of how once, when the prince was yelling with pain because of a boil on his finger, the nurses took him to the king who was then holding court. To soothe the child, the king put the offending finger in his mouth, where the boil burst. Unable to spit the pus out the king swallowed it (DA.i.138). The other explanation is that also found in the Upanisads, (Dial.ii.78f ) and this is probably the correct one. It says that the word means \"he against whom there has arisen no foe.\"</p>", "<p> </p><p>According to the Digha Commentary, (i.237-8) Aj\u00e1tasattu was born in the Lohakumbhiya niraya after his death. He will suffer there for 60,000 years, and later will reach nibbana as a Pacceka Buddha named Viditavisesa (Vijit\u00e1v\u00ed). Aj\u00e1tasattu\u2019s crime of parricide is often given as an example of an upacchedaka-kamma which has the power of destroying the effect of meritorious deeds (E.g., AA.i.369). He is also mentioned as the worst kind of parricide (E.g. AA.i.335).</p><p> </p><p>Aj\u00e1tasattu seems to have been held in hatred by the Niganthas. The reason is probably that given in the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.66f), where it is said that when Moggall\u00e1na had been killed by thieves, spies were sent out by the king to discover the murderers. When arrested, the murderers confessed that they had been incited by the Niganthas. The king thereupon buried five hundred Niganthas waist-deep in pits dug in the palace court and had their heads ploughed off.</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Akitti (v.l.

Only the th\u00fapa now stands. It was built by King Vattag\u00e1mani Abhaya on the site of the ancient Titth\u00e1r\u00e1ma, 217 years, 10 months and 10 days after the founding of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra (Mhv.xxxvii.78-83). Tradition states that when the king was fleeing from the Tamils he passed the Titth\u00e1r\u00e1ma on his way, and the Nigantha Giri, who then lived there, made insulting remarks about him. The king vowed, if he were returned to the throne, to build a vih\u00e1ra on that spot (Mhv.xxxvii.43-4); he fulfilled his vow, and the name of the vih\u00e1ra was a combination of his own name and of that of the Nigantha. The monastery was given in charge of the Thera Mah\u00e1tissa of Kuppikala and of two other monks, Kuppikala having befriended the king in his misfortunes.</p><p> </p><p>The vih\u00e1ra advanced rapidly in wealth and in power, but quite soon the monks seceded from the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra fraternity because, according to the Mah\u00e1vamsa (Mhv.xxxvii.95ff), an incumbent of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra, Mah\u00e1tissa by name, was expelled from the monastery for frequenting lay families. His disciple, Bahalamassutissa, went in anger to Abhayagiri and formed a separate faction.</p><p>A Sinhalese chronicle, the Nik\u00e1ya Sahgraha (pp.11, 12; also P.L.C.42), states that these dissentients were soon after joined by a body of Vajjiputtaka monks from the Pall\u00e1r\u00e1ma in India, under the leadership of a teacher called Dhammaruci, and the sect which they together founded in Ceylon became known as the Dhammaruci Nik\u00e1ya, with headquarters in Abhayagiri.</p><p> </p><p>For quite a long while the two fraternities, that of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra and that of the Abhayagiri, seem to have", "lived in amity, alike enjoying the munificence of patrons (Ibid., 52f.; Mhv.xxxv.20, 57, 119-22; xxxvi.7-14). Thus, Gajab\u00e1hukag\u00e1mani raised the height of Abhayuttara-th\u00fapa (as the th\u00fapa at Abhayagiri seems to have been called) and made the G\u00e1manitissa-tank to be used for the cultivation of land for the maintenance of the vihara (Ibid., xxxv.119-22); Kanitthatissa built a splendid structure in the same vih\u00e1ra for the Thera Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ga; it was called the Ratanap\u00e1s\u00e1da (xxxvi.7, 8.).</p><p> </p><p>But in the reign of Voh\u00e1rakatissa, the Abhayagiri monks openly adopted the heretical Vaitulya Pitaka (of the Mah\u00e1y\u00e1nists see Mhv. trans. 259, n.2). An inquiry was held by the king with the help of his minister Kapila, the heretical books were burnt and the monks of Abhayagiri disgraced (Mhv.xxxvi.40-1).</p><p> </p><p>Soon afterwards, however, the heretics won over the king Mah\u00e1sena to their side and destroyed the establishment of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra, carrying away all the materials to Abhayagiri (P.L.C. 53; Mhv.xxxvii.10-16). Later, Mah\u00e1sena repented of his ways, burnt the books of the Abhayagiri monks and transferred his patronage to the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra. But the Abhayagiri fraternity must soon have recovered its prestige, for we find Mah\u00e1sena's successor, Sirimeghavanna, planting a bodhi tree (called Tissavasabha) (Cv.trans. i.9, n.3) in Abhayagiri and surrounding it with a stone terrace ((Cv.xxxvii.91)). A few years later both Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma (409-31) and his queen became active supporters of Abhaya Giri (Cv.xxxvii.212). Dh\u00e1tusena is stated to have enlarged the Abhayuttara-vih\u00e1ra (Cv.xxxviii.61), and Sil\u00e1k\u00e1la is credited with several benefactions to the vih\u00e1ra and its bodhi tree (Cv.xli.31-2); Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ga gave the weaver's village of Jambela to the Uttaravih\u00e1ra (another name for Abhayagiri; see Cv. trans. i.8, n.2; 61, n.6.); Aggabodhi I. built a", "bathing-tank there (Cv.xlii.28), while his successor, Aggabodhi II., built the D\u00e1th\u00e1ggabodhi house, so called after himself and his queen (Cv.xlii.63-5).</p><p> </p><p>In the monastery at Abhayagiri there seems to have been a stone image of the Buddha, referred to under various names, Sil\u00e1sambuddha, K\u00e1lasela, K\u00e1lasatth\u00e1, Sil\u00e1satth\u00e1 and Sil\u00e1mayamuninda. Cv.xxxix.7; xxxviii.65; 61.2; see also vv.51, 77, 87. There was also in Abhayagiri another image called the Abhiseka (q.v.). </p><p> </p><p>It was evidently held peculiarly sacred. Buddhad\u00e1sa placed a n\u00e1gamani in its eye (Cv.xxxvii.123); this was soon lost, and we find Dh\u00e1tusena replacing it, adorning and decorating the statue in various ways (For details see Cv.xxxviii.62ff). Sil\u00e1meghavanna had it restored and redecorated and made provision for its maintenance (Cv.xliv.68). The same king, we are told, attempted to carry out a reform of the Abhayagiri monks, but this attempt ultimately brought disaster on him (Cv.xliv.75ff). Jetthatissa gave to the vih\u00e1ra the village of Mah\u00e1d\u00e1ragiri (Cv.xliv.96). D\u00e1thopatissa built the Kapp\u00fara-parivena attached to the vih\u00e1ra, and also a monastery Tiputthulla, encroaching on the precincts of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra, notwithstanding the protests of the monks belonging to the</p><p>Latter (Cv.xlv.29ff). Aggabodhi VII, added the Sabhattudesabhoga (Cv.xlviii.64), and Mahinda II. the Mah\u00e1lekha-parivena as well as the many-storeyed Ratanap\u00e1s\u00e1da with its costly ornamentation (Cv.xlviii.135-40; see also Geiger's trans. 123, n.2).</p><p>Sena I. built the Virankur\u00e1r\u00e1ma and gave it to the Mah\u00e1sanghikas (Cv.l.68-9), while his consort, Sangh\u00e1, erected a dwelling house, Mahindasena (Cv.l.79), and his courtier, Uttara, yet another dwelling house, called Uttarasena, for the maintenance of which he provided. Two other courtiers, Vajira and Rakkhasa, built two dwelling houses, called", "respectively Vajirasenaka and Rakkhasa (Cv.l.83).</p><p> </p><p>In the reign of Sena II. the Pamsukulika monks, who till then had evidently lived in Abhayagiri (Cv. trans. i.108, n.1), separated and formed special groups. Sangh\u00e1, queen of Udaya II., erected and endowed the building known as the Sanghasenapabbata (Cv.li.86-7). Kassapa IV. built a p\u00e1s\u00e1da bearing his name and assigned to it a village (Cv.lii.13; Cv.trs. i.162, n.4), while his successor, Kassapa V., erected the Bhandik\u00e1-parivena and the Sil\u00e1meghapabbata, endowing each with a village (Cv.lii.58-9).</p><p>Sena III. spent 40,000 kah\u00e1panas for a stone paving round the cetiya. The Abhayagiri monks befriended both Vijayab\u00e1hu I. (then known as Kitti) and his brother, and out of gratitude Vijayab\u00e1hu built the Uttaram\u00fala-parivena, which was probably attached to the vihara itself (Cv.lvii.18, 23).</p><p> </p><p>In the reign of Parakkamab\u00e1hu I., when that monarch had established himself on the throne, it is said that he tried to reform the monks of the Abhayagiri, but he found the task hopeless (Cv.lxxviii.21ff). He found that the Abhayagiri-th\u00fapa had been destroyed by the vandalism of the Tamils, and he had it restored to a height of 160 cubits (Cv.lxxviii.98). When Anur\u00e1dhapura was finally abandoned, Abhayagiri fell into ruin and decay, the monastery being completely destroyed.</p><p> </p><p>It is clear that even at the outset there was considerable rivalry between the monks of Abhayagiri and those of the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra. The rivalry seems originally to have been mainly personal, but it later developed into differences in doctrinal opinion. Of the exact nature of these latter we have no information, owing, chiefly, to the book-burnings carried out by pious kings in the excess of their zeal for the purity of the", "Faith. For the same reason we are unable to ascertain what part, if any, the Abhayagiri fraternity played in literary activity. It has been suggested, however, that both the J\u00e1takatthakath\u00e1 (P.L.C.124, 125) and the Sahassavatthuppakarana (P.L.C.128), another compilation of tales, were the work of the Abhayagiri monks.</p><p> </p><p>Fa-Hsien evidently spent the two years of his stay in Ceylon with the Abhayagiri fraternity because the books he took away with him were those of the unorthodox schools. According to him, there were, at this time, 5,000 monks in Abhayagiri (Fa Hsien's Travels, 67ff).</p><p> </p><p>In the chronicles Abhayagiri is referred to under several names Abhayuttara, Abhayavih\u00e1ra, Abhay\u00e1cala and Uttaravih\u00e1ra.</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Ag\u00e1rava Sutta</h2>  </li></ul><hr><p>1.

Later, with Mah\u00e1-Kacc\u00e1na's leave, he visited the Buddha in the Majjhimadesa and was warmly received by him (ThagA.i.238).

Citta-gahapati invited the monks to a meal. On this occasion Citta asked a question regarding the Buddha's teaching on the diversity of the elements. The chief Elder, being unable to answer, remained silent. Isidatta, though the most junior of the whole company, obtained the chief Elder's permission, and answered the question to the satisfaction of Citta. Citta likewise asked questions regarding various views, such as the infinity of the world, etc. At the end of the discourse, Citta discovered, by accident, that the Elder who had preached to him was none other", "than his unseen friend, Isidatta. Delighted with the discovery, he invited Isidatta to spend his time at a Macchik\u00e1sanda, promising to provide him with all requisites.

Their duty was to look after the ladies of the king's harem when these went riding the elephant into the park. This often brought them into close contact with the ladies, and they confessed to the Buddha that it was difficult not to have evil thoughts regarding them.</p><p>Isidatta and Pur\u00e1na were once at S\u00e1dhuka' on some business (their own property, according to Buddhaghosa, SA.i.215). They heard that the Buddha was having a robe made before starting on his rounds and they waited for an opportunity to talk to him. When the opportunity came they followed the Buddha and told him how glad they always were when he was near them and how sad when he was away on tour. The Buddha preaches to them the glory of the homeless life and urges them to put forth energy. He speaks very appreciatively of their loyalty to him and to his religion and congratulates them on the possession of virtuous qualities, such as sharing all their goods with holy men, a rare quality (S.v.348-52; Netti. 134f).</p><p>According to the Samyutta Commentary (i.215), Isidatta was a Sakad\u00e1g\u00e1m\u00ed and Pur\u00e1na a Sot\u00e1panna.</p><p>In the Dhammacetiya Sutta (M.ii.123f), Pasenadi tells the Buddha how impressed he is by the reverence Isidatta and Pur\u00e1na show for the Buddha and his teachings. \"They are my carriage-builders,\" says the king, \"and they depend on me for their livelihood and all their", "honours, yet these men do not serve me as whole-heartedly as they do the Lord.\"</p><p>Once the king spent the night in a cramped little house.

It is that a man should neither see forms with his eyes, nor hear words with his ears, says Uttara. Whereupon the Buddha retorts that in that case the deaf and the blind have reached development.

The Buddha commended their self denial in a verse, and Yasoja, appreciating the Buddha's praise, uttered two other verses, exalting the love of solitude (Thag.243 5).</p><p>In the time of Vipass\u00ed Buddha Yasoja belonged to a family of park-keepers (\u00e1r\u00e1magopak\u00e1), and one day seeing the Buddha travel through the air, he gave him a labuja fruit (ThagA.i.356). In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Yasoja was the leader of a band of five hundred robbers. They were pursued by the villagers and fled into the forest for safety. There they saw a monk sitting on a stone and asked him for protection. He advised them to take the five precepts, and when they had done so, he exhorted them never to violate these precepts even if keeping them meant the loss of their lives. Soon after, they were captured and killed. But remembering the monk's admonition at the moment of death, they harboured no hatred against anyone, and after death were reborn in the deva world (UdA.179f).</p><p>The Vinaya relates (Vin.i.239) how once, when Yasoja was ill, drugs were brought for his use, but as the Buddha had forbidden the use of a special place for storing such things (kappiyabh\u00fami) they were left out of doors and were partly eaten by vermin, the remainder being carried away by robbers. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he allowed the use of a duly chosen kappiyabh\u00fami. The Apad\u00e1na verses ascribed to Yasoja in the", "Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 are, in the Apad\u00e1na itself, found in two places: one under Labujad\u00e1yaka (Ap.ii.409) and the other, with slight variations, under Labujaphalad\u00e1yaka.

Bimbis\u00e1ra reported this to the Buddha, who at once accepted the challenge, explaining that the rule was for his disciples and did not apply to himself. He, therefore, went to S\u00e1vatthi, the place where all Buddhas perform the Miracle. In reply to Pasenadi, the Buddha said he would perform the miracle at the foot of the Gandamba tree on the full moon day of As\u00e1lha. This was in the seventh year after the Enlightenment (DA.i.57). </p><p>The heretics therefore uprooted all mango trees for one league around, but, on the promised day, the Buddha went to the king's garden, accepted the mango offered by Ganda, and caused a marvelous tree to sprout from its seed. The people, discovering what the heretics had done, attacked them, and they had to flee helter skelter. It was during this flight that P\u00farana Kassapa (q.v.) committed suicide. The multitude, assembled to witness the miracle, extended to a distance of thirty six leagues. The Buddha created a jewelled walk in the air by the side of the Gandamba. When the Buddha's disciples knew what was in his mind, several of them offered to perform miracles and so refute the insinuations of the heretics. Among such disciples were Gharan\u00ed, Culla An\u00e1tthapindika, C\u00edr\u00e1, Cunda, Uppalavann\u00e1 and Moggall\u00e1na. </p><p>The Buddha refused their offers and related the Kanhausabha and Nandivis\u00e1la J\u00e1takas. Then, standing on the jewelled walk, he proceeded to perform the Yamaka-p\u00e1tih\u00e1riya (Twin Miracle), so called because it consisted in the appearance of phenomena of", "opposite character in pairs -  e.g., producing flames from the upper part of the body and a stream of water from the lower, and then alternatively. Flames of fire and streams of water also proceeded alternatively from the right side of his body and from the left. DA.l.57; DhA.iii.214f. explains how this was done. From every pore of his body rays of six colors darted forth, upwards to the realm of Brahm\u00e1 and downwards to the edge of the Cakkav\u00e1la. The Miracle lasted for a long while, and as the Buddha walked up and down the jewelled terrace he preached to the multitude from time to time. It is said that he performed miracles and preached sermons during sixteen days, according to the various dispositions of those present in the assembly. At the conclusion of the Miracle, the Buddha, following the example of his predecessors, made his way, in three strides, to T\u00e1vatimsa, there to preach the Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother, now born as a devaputta.</p><p>The Twin Miracle is described at DA.i.57, and in very great detail at DhA.iii.204; see also J.iv.263ff.

Yasa Thera. </b>He was the son of a very wealthy treasurer of Benares, and was brought up in great luxury, living in three mansions, according to the seasons and surrounded with all kinds of pleasures. Impelled by antecedent conditions, he saw one night the indecorum of his sleeping attendants, and, greatly distressed, put on his gold slippers and left the house and the town, non humans opening the gates for him. He took the direction of Isipatana, exclaiming: \"Alas! What distress! Alas! What danger!\" The Buddha saw him in the distance and called to him, \"Come Yasa, here is neither distress nor danger.\" Filled with joy, Yasa took off his slippers and sat beside the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a graduated discourse, and when he had finished teaching the Truths, Yasa attained realization of the Dhamma. To Yasa's father, too, who had come in search of his son, the Buddha preached the Doctrine, having first made Yasa invisible to him. (This is given as an example of the Buddha's iddhi power, Vsm.393).  At the end of the sermon he acknowledged himself the Buddha's follower, (he thus became the first tev\u00e1cika up\u00e1saka) and Yasa, who had been listening, became an arahant. When, therefore, Yasa's presence became known to his father, who asked him to return to his grieving mother, the Buddha declared that household life had no attractions for Yasa and granted his request to be admitted to the Order. The next day, at the invitation of Yasa's father, he went, accompanied by Yasa, to his house, and there, at the conclusion of the meal, he preached to Yasa's mother and other members of the household, who all became his followers, thus becoming the first tev\u00e1cik\u00e1 up\u00e1sik\u00e1. When Yasa's intimate friends, Vimala, Sub\u00e1hu, Punnaji and Gavampati, heard of Yasa's ordination they followed his", "example and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course, as did fifty others of Yasa's former friends and acquaintances (Vin.i.15 20; DhA.i.72).</p><p>In the time of Sumedha Buddha, Yasa was a king of the N\u00e1gas and invited the Buddha and his monks to his abode, where he showed them great honour and hospitality. He then gave costly robes to the Buddha and to each monk a pair of valuable robes. In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a Treasurer, and offered the seven kinds of jewels at the Bodhi tree. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk. For eighteen thousand kappas he was a deva king and one thousand times he was king of men. Wherever he went he had a gold canopy, and in his last life over his funeral pyre was a gold canopy (ThagA.i.232f). He is evidently identical with Sabbad\u00e1yaka of the Apad\u00e1na (Ap.i.333f). A verse attributed to him is found in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 (vs.117).</p><p>Yasa is often quoted as one who enjoyed great luxury in his lay life (AA.ii.596).</p><p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.82f ) states that, in a past life, Yasa and his four companions wandered about engaged in various acts of social service. One day they came across the dead body of a pregnant woman, which they took to the cemetery to be cremated. There the others went away, leaving Yasa to finish the work. While burning the corpse his mind was filled with thoughts of the foulness of the human body; he drew the attention of his friends to this idea, and, later, of his parents and wives, all of whom approved of what he said. For this reason Yasa felt revulsion against the household life, and his friends and members of his family were able to realize the Dhamma early in the Buddha's career.</p><p>The ordination of Yasa was one of the scenes of the Buddha's life to be sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa", "(Mhv.xxx.79).</p><p>According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.218f), Suj\u00e1t\u00e1 Sen\u00e1n\u00eddh\u00edt\u00e1 (who gave the Buddha a meal of milk rice just before his Enlightenment) was Yasa's mother. She became a sot\u00e1panna after listening to the Buddha's sermon.</p><hr><p><b>2. Yasa. </b>Called <b>K\u00e1kandakaputta</b></p><p>He was the son of the brahmin K\u00e1kandaka and was a pupil of Ananda. It is said he was fortunate enough to see the Buddha alive (Mhv.iv.57f).  </p><p>When he arrived at the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa')\">K\u00fat\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1</a> in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavana')\">Mah\u00e1vana</a>, he discovered that the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjiputtakaa')\">Vajjian</a> monks had raised the \"Ten Points\" (dasavatthu) contrary to the Buddha's teachings, and that they were publicly asking for money from their lay disciples. Yasa thereupon protested against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, offered him a share of the money they had collected.  </p><p>This offer he rejected with scorn, and the monks passed on him the Patis\u00e1rattiyakamma (craving of pardon from lay folk). This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having misinformed them. But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha's discourses to prove his charge.  </p><p>When the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the Ukkhepaniya Kamma (Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared through the air to Kosamb\u00ed, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, of the west (P\u00e1theyyak\u00e1 or P\u00e1veyyak\u00e1) and of the south (Dakkhin\u00e1patha), asking", "for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion. With them he visited Sambh\u00fata S\u00e1nav\u00e1s\u00ed at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata')\">Revata</a> who lived in Soreyya. Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahaj\u00e1ti.

After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed (to settle the matter by an Ubb\u00e1hik\u00e1) of four from the East: Sabbak\u00e1m\u00ed, S\u00e1lha, Khujjasobhita, and V\u00e1sabhag\u00e1mika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambh\u00fata-S\u00e1nav\u00e1s\u00ed, Yasa and Sumana. They debated the question at the V\u00e1lik\u00e1r\u00e1ma, Revata acting as questioner and Sabbak\u00e1m\u00ed answering his questions. At the end of the enquiry the decision was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was conveyed to the assembly. Then the recital of the Vinaya was held in which seven hundred monks participated; this recital was called the Sattasat\u00ed. Vin.ii.294ff.; Mhv.iv.9ff.;; Dpv.iv.45ff.; v.23.

The Sattasat\u00ed Recital (also called The Second Recital) was also named (E.g., AA.i.251; MA.ii.880) Yasathera sang\u00edti, evidently because of the prominent part played by Yasa.</p><p>Yasa is ranked (See, e.g., DA.ii.525) among the great benefactors of the religion.</p><hr><p><b>3.

The name is probably the P\u00e1li equivalent for Ionians, the Baktrian Greeks. The Yonas are mentioned with the Kambojas in Rock Edicts v. and xii of Asoka, as a subject people, forming a frontier district of his empire. The country was converted by the Thera Mah\u00e1rakkhita, who was sent there after the Third Council (Mhv.xii.5; Dpv.viii.9; Sp.i.67). In the time of Milinda the capital of the Yona country was S\u00e1gala (Mil.1). It is said (Mhv.xxix.39) that at the Foundation Ceremony of the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa, thirty thousand monks, under Yona Mah\u00e1dhammarakkhita, came from Alasand\u00e1 in the Yona country. Alasand\u00e1 was evidently the headquarters of the Buddhist monks at that time. Alasand\u00e1 is generally identified (See, e.g., Geiger, Mhv. Trs. 194, n.3) with the Alexandria founded by the Macedonian king (Alexander) in the country of the Paropanisadae near K\u00e1bul.</p><p>In the Assal\u00e1yana Sutta (M.ii.149), Yona and Kamboja are mentioned as places in which there were only two classes of people, masters and slaves, and the master could become a slave or vice versa. The Commentary (MA.ii.784) explains this by saying that supposing a brahmin goes there and dies, his children might consort with slaves, in which case their children would be slaves. In later times, the name Yavan\u00e1 or Yon\u00e1 seems to have included all westerners living in India and especially those of Arabian origin (Cv.Trs.ii.87, n.1). Yonaka, statues, holding lamps, were among the decorations used by the S\u00e1kyans of Kapilavatthu (MA.ii.575).

When the Buddha reached T\u00e1vatimsa in three strides, his first stride was from the earth to Yugandhara (DhA.iii.216). It was on the summit of Yugandhara that Assagutta convened an assembly of the monks in order to discuss their plan of campaign against Milinda (Mil.p.6).

They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, D\u00e1navas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? N\u00e1gas) (E.g., J.v.420).  </p><p>In other lists (E.g., PvA. 45, 55) they range immediately above the Petas; in fact, some of the happier Petas are called Yakkhas. Elsewhere (E.g., A.ii.38) they rank, in progressive order, between manuss\u00e1 and gandhabb\u00e1. They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks. In the early records, yakkha, like n\u00e1g\u00e1, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative. Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to (M.i.252; J.iv.4; DA.i.264), but even the Buddha is spoken of as a yakkha in poetic diction (M.i.386). Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed (S.i.54).  </p><p>According to a passage in the Vim\u00e1navatthu Commentary, (VvA.333) which gives illustrations, the term is used for Sakka, the Four Regent Gods (Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1no), the followers of Vessavana, and also for puriso (individual soul?). In the scholiast to the Jayadissa J\u00e1taka (J.v.33), the figure of the hare in the moon is also called yakkha. Of these above named, the followers of Vessavana appear to be the Yakkhas proper. The term yakkha as applied to purisa is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning \"soul\" in such passages as ett\u00e1vat\u00e1 yakkhassa suddhi (SN.vs.478), or ett\u00e1vat' aggam no vadanti h' ek\u00e1, yakkhassa suddhim idha p\u00e1ndit\u00e1se (SN.vs.875).  </p><p>In the Niddesa (MNid.282), yakkha is explained by satta, nara, m\u00e1nava, posa, puggala, j\u00edva, jagu, jantu, indagu, manuja. The last term is significant as showing that yakkha also means \"man.\"</p><p>The cult of yakkhas seems to have arisen primarily from", "the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants. To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vim\u00e1nas found in or near the sea or in lakes. The worship of trees and the spirits inhabitating them is one of the most primitive forms of religion. Some, at least, of the yakkhas are called rukkha devat\u00e1 (E.g., J.iii.309, 345; Pv.i.9; PvA.5) (spirits of trees), and others bhummadevat\u00e1, (PvA.45,55) (spirits of the earth), who, too, seem to have resided in trees. Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva's supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful. They are sometimes called devat\u00e1 (E.g., S.i.205), or devaputta (E.g., PvA. 113, 139). Some of these, like Indak\u00fata and Suciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics. All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will. An epithet frequently applied is mahiddhika (E.g., Pv.ii.9; J.vi.118). Their appearance is striking as a result of former good kamma (Pv.i.2, 9; ii.11; iv.3, etc.). They are also called k\u00e1mak\u00e1m\u00ed, enjoying all kinds of luxuries (Pv.i.3), but, because of former bad kamma, they are possessed of odd qualities, thus they are shy, they fear palmyra leaf and iron. Their eyes are red and they neither wink nor cast a shadow. J.iv.492; v.34; vi.336, 337; these various characteristics are, obviously, not found in all Yakkhas. The Yakkhas are evidently of different grades -  as is the case with all classes of beings \u2013 the highest among them approximate very nearly to the devas and have deva-powers, the lowest resemble petas. The Yakkhas are specially mentioned as being afraid of palm leaves (J.iv.492).</p><p>Their abode is their self created palace, which is", "anywhere, in the air, in trees, etc. These are mostly \u00e1kasattha (suspended in the air), but some of them, like the abode of \u00c1lavaka, are bhumattha (on the ground) and are described as being fortified (SNA.i.222). Sometimes whole cities   e.g., \u00c1lakamand\u00e1   stand under the protection of, or are inhabited by, Yakkhas.</p><p>In many respects they resemble the Vedic Pis\u00e1cas, though they are of different origin. They are evidently remnants of an ancient demonology and have had incorporated in them old animistic beliefs as representing creatures of the wilds and the forests, some of them based on ethnological features. (See Stede: Gespenstergeschichten des Petavatthu v.39ff ).</p><p>In later literature the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres. The female Yakkhas (Yakkhin\u00ed) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male. They eat flesh and blood (J.iv.549; v.34); and devour even men (D.ii.346; J.ii.15ff.) and corpses (J.i.265). They eat babies (J.v.21; vi.336) and are full of spite and vengeance (DhA.i.47; ii.35f.). The story of Bh\u00fata Thera is interesting because his elder brothers and sisters were devoured by a hostile Yakkha, so the last child is called Bh\u00fata to propitiate the Yakkha by making him the child's sponsor!</p><p>Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence. They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii. In the At\u00e1n\u00e1tiya Sutta (D.iii.194f), however, the Yakkha king, Vessavana, is represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the Yakkhas. Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in", "their woodland haunts. Cp. the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill S\u00e1riputta (Ud.iv.4). But the Mah\u00e1 Yakkhas (a list in D.iii.204f), the generals and commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent wicked Yakkhas from hurting them. Among Yakkhas are some beings who are sot\u00e1pannas -  e.g., Janavasabha, Suciloma and Khara (s.v.). Some Yakkhas even act as messengers from another world, and will save prospective sinners from committing evil (Pv.iv.1). The case of the Yakkha Vajirap\u00e1ni is of special interest. D.i.95. The Commentary (DA.i.264) says he is not an ordinary Yakkha, but Sakka himself.</p><p>He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the air, threatening to kill Ambattha, if he does not answer the Buddha's question the third time he is asked. In many cases the Yakkhas are \"fallen angels\" and come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to a higher sphere of existence   e.g., Piyankaram\u00e1t\u00e1 and Punabbasum\u00e1t\u00e1, and even Vessavana, listening to Velukandak\u00ed Nandam\u00e1t\u00e1 reciting the Par\u00e1yana Vagga (A.iv.63). At the preaching of the Mah\u00e1samaya Sutta (q.v.) many hundreds of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.</p><p>It has been pointed out (Stede, op. cit) that the names of the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function. These are taken from (a) their bodily appearance   e.g., Kuvann\u00e1, Khara, Kharaloma, Kharad\u00e1thika, Citta, Cittar\u00e1ja, Silesaloma, S\u00faciloma and H\u00e1rit\u00e1; (b) their place of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc.   e.g., Ajakal\u00e1paka, \u00c1lavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), Kumbh\u00edra, Gumbiya, Dis\u00e1mukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, Vajirap\u00e1ni or Vajirab\u00e1hu, S\u00e1t\u00e1gira, Ser\u00edsaka; (c) qualities of character, etc.   e.g., Adhamma, Katattha, Dhamma, Punnaka, M\u00e1ra, Sakata; (d) embodiments of former persons", "e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= Bimbis\u00e1ra), D\u00edgha, Naradeva, Pandaka, S\u00edvaka, Ser\u00ed.</p><p>Vessavana (q.v.) is often mentioned as king of the Yakkhas. He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the \u00c1t\u00e1n\u00e1tiya Sutta (D.iii.199ff) contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly halls. Vessavana is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and messengers. They wait upon him in turn. The Yakkhin\u00eds draw water for him, and often are so hard worked that many die in his service. E.g., J.iv.492. Mention is also made (e.g., DA.ii.370) of Yakkhad\u00e1s\u00eds who have to dance and sing to the devas during the night. Early in the morning they drink a cup of toddy (sur\u00e1) and go off into a deep sleep, from which they rise betimes in the evening ready for their duties.</p><p>No one, apparently, is free from this necessity of waiting upon the king   even Janavasabba has to run errands for Vessavana (D.ii.207). Among the duties of Vessavana is the settling of disputes between the devas, and this keeps him (J.vi.270) much occupied. In this work he is helped by the Yakkhasen\u00e1pati, whose business it is to preside over the courts during eight days of each mouth (SNA.i.197). The Yakkhas hold regular assemblies on Manosil\u00e1tala on the Bhagalavat\u00edpabbata (SNA.i.187; cp. D.iii.201 and DA.iii.967). As followers of Kuvera, lord of riches, the Yakkhas are the guardians and the liberal spenders of underground riches, hidden treasures, etc., with which they delight men. E.g., Pv.ii.11; PvA.145; Pv.iv.12; PvA.274. These were seven yakkhas who guarded the wealth of Jotiyasetthi (DhA.iv.208f.).</p><p>It is difficult to decide whether the Yakkhas, who are the aborigines of Ceylon (Lank\u00e1), were considered human or non human. Kuven\u00ed, one of their princesses, and her maid, can both assume different forms, but Vijaya", "marries Kuveni and has two children by her. (Cp. Vin.iii.37; iv. 20; where sexual intercourse with a Yakkha is forbidden). The Yakkhas are invisible, and Vijaya is able to kill them only with the help of Kuveni (Mhv.vii.36); but their clothes are found fit for Vijaya and his followers to wear (Mhv.vii.38). Again, Cetiy\u00e1 (q.v.) could make herself invisible and assume the form of a mare, but Panduk\u00e1bhaya lived with her for four years and she gave him counsel in battle. Later, when he held festivities, he had the Yakkha Cittar\u00e1ja on the throne beside him (Mhv.x.87). In all probability these Yakkhas were originally considered as humans, but later came to be confused with non humans. Their chief cities were Lank\u00e1pura and Sir\u00edsavatthu.</p><p>The commonly accepted etymology of Yakkha is from the root yaj, meaning to sacrifice. Thus: yajanti tattha balim upaharant\u00ed ti yakkha (VvA.224), or p\u00fajan\u00edyabh\u00e1vato yakkho, ti uccati (VvA.333).</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Yavakal\u00e1piya Sutta</h2>  </li></ul><p>If six men, armed with flails, were to beat out a sheaf of corn, it would be thoroughly threshed.

His earlier name was Kitti; his parents were Moggall\u00e1na and Lokit\u00e1 (Cv.lvii.42f.; but see Cv.Trs.i.201, n.1), and from his thirtieth year he lived in M\u00falas\u00e1l\u00e1. Later, without the knowledge of his parents, he left home, defeated the general Loka, and became Adip\u00e1da of Malaya after bringing this province under his power. At the age of sixteen he defeated Kassapa, chief of the Kesadh\u00e1tus, and became ruler of Rohana as well, assuming the title of Yuvar\u00e1ja and the name of Vijayab\u00e1hu. At this time the Colas were in possession of the government at Pulatthipura, and they made efforts to stem the advance of Vijayab\u00e1hu. They were at first successful, owing to the disunion among the Singhalese themselves, but Vijayab\u00e1hu conquered the Cola armies near Palutthapabbata and marched to Pulatthipura. He was helped by forces sent by the king of R\u00e1ma\u00f1\u00f1a, to whom he sent an embassy with various presents. He had, however, to bide his time, and retreated to V\u00e1tagiri. From there he went, in due course, to Mah\u00e1n\u00e1gahula, his officers having, in the meantime, crushed all opposition in Dakkhinadesa and captured the province of Anur\u00e1dhapura and the district round Mah\u00e1tittha. When he felt the right moment had arrived, Vijayab\u00e1hu marched once more to Pulatthipura and captured it after a siege of one and a half months. From there he advanced to Anur\u00e1dhapura, spent three months in the city and returned to Pulatthipura. This was fifteen years after he became Yuvar\u00e1ja. In the eighteenth year he crowned himself king, under the title of Sirisanghabodhi, making his younger brother V\u00edrab\u00e1hu Yuvar\u00e1ja and governor of Dakkhinadesa, and his other brother, Jayab\u00e1hu, Adip\u00e1da and governor of Rohana. The king had several queens, among whom was L\u00edl\u00e1vat\u00ed, a Cola princess and", "daughter of Jagat\u00edp\u00e1la; by her he had a daughter Yasodhar\u00e1. Another of his queens was a K\u00e1linga princess, Tilokasundar\u00ed, by whom he had five daughters   Subhadd\u00e1, Sumitt\u00e1, Lokan\u00e1th\u00e1, Ratan\u00e1val\u00ed and R\u00fapavat\u00ed   and a son called Vikkamab\u00e1hu. Vijayab\u00e1hu gave his younger sister, Mitt\u00e1, in marriage to the king of Pandu, refusing an offer of marriage made by the Cola king.</p><p>When peace had been established, Vijayab\u00e1hu sent messengers to Anuruddha, king of R\u00e1ma\u00f1\u00f1a, and fetched monks from that country to help in the reformation of the Sangha in Ceylon. He gave over the whole district of Alis\u00e1ra for the use of the monks and built many vih\u00e1ras. He translated the Dhammasangani and held an annual Dandissara offering. He also had the Tipitaka copied, and presented the copies to various monks. Because the Singhalese envoys sent to Kann\u00e1ta were insulted and maimed, the king prepared to send a punitive expedition to Cola, but the Velakk\u00e1ra troops revolted, captured Mitt\u00e1 and her children, and burned the king's palace. The king was forced to retreat to Dakkhinadesa but, with the help of V\u00edrab\u00e1hu, he defeated the rebels. In the forty fifth year of his reign he took an army to Cola and stopped at a seaport in that country; but as the Cola king refused to accept his challenge to fight, he returned to his own country. He repaired many tanks and restored many vih\u00e1ras in various parts of the country. He provided facilities for pilgrims journeying to Samantak\u00fata, and patronized the L\u00e1bhav\u00e1s\u00ed and the Vantaj\u00edvaka monks. He ruled for fifty five years.

It is said that among the Asuras, Vepacitti, R\u00e1hu and Pah\u00e1rada were the chiefs. E.g., AA.ii.758, Vepacitti being the highest (sabbajetthaka, SA.i.263).</p><p>Vepacitti was the friend of R\u00e1hu, and when R\u00e1hu seized Candim\u00e1 and Suriya and these invoked the power of the Buddha, it was to Vepacitti that R\u00e1hu fled for comfort (S.i.50, 51). The Asuras being once defeated in a fight with the Devas, the latter took Vepacitti prisoner, and brought him, bound hand and foot, to Sakka in the Sudhamm\u00e1 hall. There Vepacitti reviled and railed at Sakka with scurrilous words, both on entering and on leaving the hall, but Sakka remained silent, and, when questioned by M\u00e1tal\u00ed, said it was not proper for him to bandy words with a fool. S.i.221f.; cf. S.iv.201, according to which his bondage caused him no inconvenience so long as he remained with the devas, but the moment he experienced the wish to rejoin the Asuras, he felt himself bound. Vepacitti's capture is referred to in Thag.vs.749.</p><p>On another occasion Vepacitti suggested that victory should be given to him or to Sakka, according to their excellence in speech. Sakka agreed to this, and Vepacitti, as the older god, was asked to speak a verse. Sakka spoke another, the Devas applauding. Several verses were spoken by each, and both Devas and Asuras decided in favour of Sakka, because Vepacitti's verses belonged, they said, to the sphere of violence, while those of Sakka belonged to one of concord and harmony (S.i.222f). Once, when Sakka was revolving in his mind the thought that he should not betray even his enemy, Vepacitti read his thoughts and came up to him. \"Stop,\" said Sakka, \"thou art my", "prisoner\"; but Vepacitti reminded him of his thought, and was allowed to go free (S.i.225).</p><p>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.266) that Vepacitti's original name was Sambara (q.v.). When Sambara refused to give to the seers, who visited him, a pledge that the Asuras would not harm them, the seers cursed him, and from that time onwards he slept badly and was plagued by nightmares. This so deranged his mind (cittam vepati) that he came to be called Vepacitti (\"Crazy nerve\"). When Vepacitti lay ill of this disease, Sakka visited him and offered to cure him if he would teach him Sambara's magic art. Vepacitti consulted the Asuras, and, as they were unwilling, he refused Sakka's offer, warning him that Sambara, having practised magic, was suffering in purgatory and that he should avoid a similar fate (S.i.238f).</p><p>Buddhaghosa explains that, if Vepacitti had taught him the art, it was Sakka's intention to take Vepacitti to the seers and persuade them to forgive him (SA.i.272). This episode seems to contradict Buddhaghosa\u2019s previous statement that Sambara and Vepacitti were identical. Perhaps, as Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests (KS.i.305, n.4), Sambara was the name of an office rather than that of a person.</p><p>Mention is made (S.i.226) of a visit once paid by Sakka and Vepacitti to a company of seers dwelling in a forest hut. Vepacitti, in his buskins, his sword hanging at his side and his state canopy borne over his head, entered by the main gate, while Sakka, in all humility, used the side gate. Buddhaghosa explains (SA.i.265) the strange relations of Sakka and Vepacitti by saying that they were father  and son in law, and that they were sometimes at war with each other; sometimes, however, they lived in concord. The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.278 L; cf. J.i.205f ) gives the story of the romantic marriage of Sakka to Vepacitti's daughter, Suj\u00e1 (q.v.).</p>", "<p>According to the Kath\u00e1 vatthu, other members of Vepacitti's family appear to have intermarried with the devas, and the Kath\u00e1 vatthu Commentary says that a troop of Asuras, belonging to the retinue of Vepacitti, was once freed from the fourfold plane of misery and was taken up among the devas.

A year later his enemies again rose in revolt, led by M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana, and, as Vikkamab\u00e1hu advanced to Kalyan\u00ed to fight them, V\u00edradeva, of Paland\u00edpa (q.v.) landed in Mann\u00e1ra, and his attention was diverted. In the first engagements, Vikkamab\u00e1hu was defeated by V\u00edradeva and forced to flee to Kotthas\u00e1ra, but V\u00edradeva was later defeated and slain at Antaravitthika. From then onwards Vikkamab\u00e1hu and the three sons of Mitt\u00e1 (see above) lived each in his province, but became unpopular both with the sangha and the laity owing to their greed and lust. Following the death of Jayab\u00e1hu and the Queen Mitt\u00e1, Vikkamab\u00e1hu appears to have been acknowledged king (Vikkamab\u00e1hu II.); and it was evidently as such that the birth of his nephew, the prince who after became Parakkamab\u00e1hu. I., was reported to him. Vikkamab\u00e1hu had two sons, Mahinda, and Gajab\u00e1hu, but asked that his nephew should be sent to the court; this request, however, was not granted (Cv.lxii.58f).

D.iii.194; he was spokesman because \"he was intimate with the Buddha, expert in conversation, well trained\" (DA.iii.962).</p><p>He rides in the N\u00e1r\u00edv\u00e1hana, which is twelve yojanas long, its seat being of coral.

He is a sot\u00e1panna and his life span is ninety thousand years (AA.ii.718). The books record a conversation between him and Velukantak\u00ed Nandam\u00e1ta (q.v.), when he heard her sing the Par\u00e1yana Vagga and stayed to listen. When C\u00falasubhadd\u00e1 wished to invite the Buddha and his monks to her house in S\u00e1keta, and felt doubtful about it, Vessavana appeared before her and said that the Buddha would come at her invitation (AA.ii.483).</p><p>On another occasion (A.iv.162; on his way to see the Buddha) he heard Uttara Thera preaching to the monks in Dhavaj\u00e1lik\u00e1 on the Sankheyya Mountain, near Mahisavatthu, and went and told Sakka, who visited Uttara and had a discussion with him.</p><p>Once when Vessavana was travelling through the air, he saw Sambh\u00fata Thera wrapt in sam\u00e1dhi. Vessavana descended from his chariot, worshipped the Thera, and left behind two Yakkhas with orders to wait until the", "Elder should emerge from his trance. The Yakkhas then greeted the Thera in the name of Vessavana and told him they had been left to protect him. The Elder sent thanks to Vessavana, but informed him, through the Yakkhas, that the Buddha had taught his disciples to protect themselves through mindfulness, and so further protection was not needed. Vessavana visited Sambh\u00fata on his return, and finding that the Elder had become an arahant, went to S\u00e1vatthi and carried the news to the Buddha. ThagA.i.46f. Just as he encouraged the good, so he showed his resentment against the wicked; see, e.g., Revat\u00ed.</p><p>Mention is made of Vessavana's Gad\u00e1vudha* and his mango tree, the Atulamba**.

Vessavana seems to have been worshipped by those desiring children. See, e.g., the story of R\u00e1jadatta (ThagA.i.403). There was in Anur\u00e1dhapura a banyan tree dedicated as a shrine to Vessavana in the time of Panduk\u00e1bhaya (Mhv.x.89). Vessavana is mentioned as having been alive in the time of Vipass\u00ed Buddha. When Vipass\u00ed died, there was a great earthquake which terrified the people, but Vessavana appeared and quieted their fears (ThagA.i.149). Vessavana accompanied Sakka when he", "showed Moggall\u00e1na round Vejayanta p\u00e1s\u00e1da. M.i.253; because he was Sakka's very intimate friend (MA.i.476).</p><p>As lord of the Yakkhas, it was in the power of Vessavana to grant to any of them special privileges, such as the right of devouring anyone entering a particular pond, etc. See, e.g., DhA.iii.74; J.i.128; iii.325 (Makh\u00e1deva). Sometimes, e.g., in the case of Avaruddhaka (DhA.ii.237), a Yakkha had to serve Vessavana for twelve years in order to obtain a particular boon (cf. J.ii.16,17). (Three years at J.iii.502.) Vessavana some times employs the services of uncivilized human beings (paccantamilakkhav\u00e1sika) DA.iii.865f. The Yakkhas fear him greatly. If he is angry and looks but once, one thousand Yakkhas are broken up and scattered \"like parched peas hopping about on a hot plate\" (J.ii.399). This was probably before he became a sot\u00e1panna.</p><p>Vessavana, like Sakka, was not the name of a particular being, but of the holder of an office. When one Vessavana died, Sakka chose another as his successor. The new king, on his accession, sent word to all the Yakkhas, asking them to choose their special abodes (J.i.328). It was the duty of Yakkhin\u00eds to fetch water from Anotatta for Vessavana's use. Each Yakkhin\u00ed served her turn, sometimes for four, sometimes for five months. But sometimes they died from exhaustion before the end of their term. (DhA.i.40; also J.iv.492; v.21).</p><p>Vessavana's wife was Bhu\u00f1jat\u00ed (q.v.), who, like himself, was a devoted follower of the Buddha (D.ii.270).
