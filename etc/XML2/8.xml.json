Up\u00e1li Thera.</b>-One of the most eminent of the Buddha's immediate disciples. He belonged to a barber's family in Kapilavatthu and entered the service of the S\u00e1kiyan princes. When Anuruddha and his cousins left the world and sought ordination from the Buddha at Anupiy\u00e1 Grove, Up\u00e1li accompanied them. They gave him all their valuable ornaments, but, on further consideration, he refused to accept them and wished to become a monk with them. The reason given for his refusal is that he knew the S\u00e1kyans were hot-headed, and feared that the kinsmen of the princes might suspect him of having murdered the young men for the sake of their belongings.</p><p>At the request of the S\u00e1kiyan youths, the Buddha ordained Up\u00e1li before them all, so that their pride might be humbled. (Vin.ii.182; DhA.i.116f; see also Bu.i.61; but see BuA.44; the Tibetan sources give a slightly different version, see Rockhill, op. cit., pp. 55-6; according to the Mah\u00e1vastu iii.179, Up\u00e1li was the Buddha's barber, too). </p><p>Up\u00e1li's upajjh\u00e1ya was Kappitaka (Vin.iv.308). When Up\u00e1li went to the Buddha for an exercise for meditation, he asked that he might be allowed to dwell in the forest. But the Buddha would not agree, for if Up\u00e1li went into the forest he would learn only meditation, while, if he remained amongst men, he would have knowledge both of meditation and of the word of the Dhamma. Up\u00e1li accepted the Buddha's advice and, practising insight, in due course won arahantship. The Buddha himself taught Up\u00e1li the whole of the Vinaya Pitaka (ThagA.i.360f, 370; AA.i.172).</p><p>In the assembly of the Sangha, the Buddha declared him to be the most proficient of those who were learned in the Vinaya (vinayadhar\u00e1nam) (A.i.24; see also Vin.iv.142, where the Buddha is", "mentioned as speaking Up\u00e1li's praises). He is often spoken of as having reached the pinnacle of the Vinaya, or as being its chief repository (Vinaye agganikkhitto), (E.g., Dpv.iv.3, 5; v.7, 9) and three particular cases - those of Ajjuka (Vin.iii.66f), the Bh\u00e1rukacchaka monk (Vin.iii.39) and Kum\u00e1ra-Kassapa (AA.i.158; MA.i.336; J.i.148; DhA.iii.145) - are frequently mentioned in this connection as instances where Up\u00e1li's decisions on Vinaya rules earned the special commendation of the Buddha. In the R\u00e1jagaha Council, Up\u00e1li took a leading part, deciding all the questions relative to the Vinaya, in the same way as Ananda decided questions regarding the Dhamma (Vin.ii.286f; DA.i.11f; Mhv.iii.30).</p><p>In accordance with this tradition, ascribing to Up\u00e1li especial authority regarding the rules of the Order, various instances are given of Up\u00e1li questioning the Buddha about the Vinaya regulations. Thus we find him consulting the Buddha as to the legality or otherwise of a complete congregation performing, in the absence of an accused monk, an act at which his presence is required (Vin.i.325f). Again, he wishes to know if, in a matter which has caused altercations and schisms among members of the Order, the Sangha declares re-establishment of concord without thorough investigation, could such a declaration be lawful? (Vin.i.358f). When a monk intends to take upon himself the conduct of any matter that has to be decided, under what conditions should he do so? What qualities should a monk possess in himself before he takes upon himself to warn others? (Vin.ii.248f). In what case can there be an interruption of the probationary period of a monk who has been placed on probation? (Vin.ii.33f).</p><p>A whole list of questions asked by Up\u00e1li and answers given by the Buddha on matters pertaining to the Vinaya rules is found in the chapter called Up\u00e1li-Pa\u00f1caka in the Pariv\u00e1ra (Vin.v.180-206; see", "also the Up\u00e1livagga of the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya v.70ff).</p><p>It is not possible to determine which of these and other questions were actually asked by Up\u00e1li, and which were ascribed to him on account of his traditional reputation.</p><p>It is said (E.g., Vin.iv.142; Sp.iv.876) that even in the Buddha's lifetime monks considered it a great privilege to learn the Vinaya under Up\u00e1li. The monks seem to have regarded Up\u00e1li as their particular friend, to whom they could go in their difficulties. Thus, when certain monks had been deprived by thieves of their clothes, it is Up\u00e1li's protection that they seek (Vin.iii.212; see also the story of Raman\u00edyavih\u00e1r\u00ed, ThagA.i.116).</p><p>The canon contains but few records of any discourses connected with Up\u00e1li, apart from his questions on the Vinaya. In the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya (A.iv.143f) he is mentioned as asking the Buddha for a brief sermon, the Buddha telling him that if there were anything that did not conduce to revulsion and detachment, Up\u00e1li could be sure that such things did not form part of the Buddha's teaching. There is a record of another sermon (A.v.201ff) which the Buddha is stated to have preached when Up\u00e1li expressed the desire to retire into the solitude of the forest. The Buddha tells him that forest-life is not for the man who has not mastered his mind or attained to tranquillity.</p><p>For other sermons see Up\u00e1li Sutta and Ubb\u00e1hika Sutta.</p><p>Three verses are ascribed to Up\u00e1li in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 (vv. 249-51; but see Gotama the Man, p.215; another verse ascribed to Up\u00e1li, but so far not traced elsewhere, is found in the Milinda p.108) where he admonishes the brethren to seek noble friends of unfaltering character, to learn the monks' code of discipline and to dwell in solitude.</p><p>In the time of Padumuttara, Up\u00e1li was a", "very rich brahmin named Suj\u00e1ta. When the Buddha came to his father's city in order to preach to him the Dhamma, Suj\u00e1ta saw him, and in the assembly be noticed an ascetic named Sunanda, holding over the Buddha for seven days a canopy of flowers. The Buddha declared that Sunanda would, in the time of Gotama Buddha, become famous as the Elder Punna Mant\u00e1n\u00ed-putta. Suj\u00e1ta, too, wished to seethe future Buddha Gotama, and having heard Padumuttara praise the monk P\u00e1tika as chief of the Vinayadharas, he wished to hear, regarding himself, a similar declaration from Gotama. With this end in view he did many deeds of merit, chief of which was the erection of a monastery named Sobhana, for the Buddha and his monks, at an expense of one hundred thousand.</p><p>As a result he was born in heaven for thirty thousand kappas and was one thousand times king of the devas. One thousand times, too, he was cakkavatti.</p><p>Two kappas ago there was a Khattiya named A\u00f1jasa, and Up\u00e1li was born as his son Sunanda. One day he went to the park riding an elephant named Sirika, and met, on the way, the Pacceka Buddha Devala, whom he insulted in various ways. Sunanda was, thereupon, seized with a sensation of great heat in his body, and it was not till he went with a large following to the Pacceka Buddha and asked his pardon that the sensation left him. It is said that if the Buddha had not forgiven him, the whole country would have been destroyed. This insult paid to the Pacceka Buddha was the cause of Up\u00e1li having been born as a barber in his last birth (Ap.i.37ff).</p><p>Buddhaghosa says (Sp.i.272, 283) that while the Buddha was yet alive Up\u00e1li drew up certain instructions according to which future Vinayadharas should interpret Vinaya rules, and that, in conjunction with others, he compiled explanatory notes on matters connected with the Vinaya.</p>", "<p>In direct pupillary succession to Up\u00e1li as head of the Vinayadharas was D\u00e1saka, whom Up\u00e1li had first met at the Valik\u00e1r\u00e1ma, where Up\u00e1li was staying (Mhv.v.10). Up\u00e1li taught him the whole of the Vinaya.</p><p>Up\u00e1li's death was in the sixth year of Ud\u00e1yibhadda's reign. Dpv.v.7ff.</p><hr><p><b>2. Up\u00e1li.</b>-A lad of R\u00e1jagaha. His parents, wishing him to live a life of ease, did not have him instructed in any of the usual means of livelihood, lest he should be inconvenienced while learning them. After much consideration, they decided to have him ordained. He joined the Order with sixteen other companions equally young, and it is said that they rose at dawn and started shouting for food. This was the reason for the rule that no one under twenty years of age should receive the upasampad\u00e1 ordination. Vin.i.77f.</p><hr><p><b>3. Up\u00e1li Thera.</b>-The Apad\u00e1na (i.91f) contains the story of a thera named Up\u00e1li, who is to be distinguished from the eminent disciple of that name, though the Apad\u00e1na verses obviously point to a confusion of the legends of the two. The Apad\u00e1na Commentary distinguishes this monk as \"Bh\u00e1gineyya Up\u00e1li,\" and states that he was a nephew of the Venerable Up\u00e1li. He was born in Kapilavatthu and was ordained by his uncle, who later became an arahant.</p><p>Bh\u00e1gineyya Up\u00e1li had been a householder in the time of Padumuttara. Later he left the world and became an ascetic in Himav\u00e1. There he met the Buddha and the monks, and uttered their praises in song.

Upananda.-A thera.</b> He belonged to the S\u00e1kyan clan. Several incidents connected with him are mentioned in the Vinaya. Once he promised to spend the rainy season with Pasenadi Kosala, but on his way there he saw two lodgings where robes were plentiful and so kept Vassa in those lodgings instead. Pasenadi was greatly annoyed and when, in due course, the matter reached the ears of the Buddha, Upananda was rebuked and a set of rules was passed regarding promises made about the rainy season (Vin.i.153). On another occasion Upananda spent the rainy season at S\u00e1vatthi, but when the time came for the monks to gather together and divide the robes that had been given to them, he went from village to village, taking his share of the robes from everywhere. The Buddha sent for him and rebuked him in the presence of the Order, but the rebuke had evidently no effect, for we find him again spending the Vassa alone in two residences, with the idea of obtaining many robes. The Buddha, however, ordered that only one portion should be given to him (Vin.i.300). His greediness was not confined to robes. Once he was invited to a meal by an official, a follower of the \u00c1j\u00edvakas. He went late, and finding no room left for him, made a junior monk get up and give him his seat. There was a great uproar, but Upananda had his way (Vin.ii.165). Elsewhere he is accused of having appropriated two lodgings for himself at the same time, one at S\u00e1vatthi and the other somewhere in the country. He was evidently unpopular among the monks, because on this occasion we find him spoken of as \"a maker of strife, quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal questions.\" (Vin.ii.168). Upananda was fond of money, for we find in the Vinaya", "(Vin.ii.297) a statement to the effect that \"on the occasion of the matter of Upananda the S\u00e1kyan, the Buddha distinctly laid down a precept by which gold and silver were forbidden.\" Upananda had been given his meals regularly by a certain</p><p>family. Once a dish of meat was prepared for him, but a little boy in the house started to cry for the meat, and it was given to him. Upananda insisted that a kah\u00e1pana should be paid to him in lieu of the meat (Vin.iii.236f). Upananda was once asked to preach to those that came to Jetavana. Among the visitors was a banker, and when the banker expressed the desire to give something to Upananda to show his appreciation of the sermon, Upananda wished to have the robe that the man wore. The banker was embarrassed, and promised to go home at once and fetch him another robe, even better than the one he had on. But Upananda was adamant, till, in despair, the man gave him his robe and went away. Again, when Upananda heard that a certain man wished to offer him a robe, he went to the man and told him what kind of robe he wanted, and said he would accept no other (Vin.iii.215). A story is also told of a Paribb\u00e1jaka exchanging his own garment for one belonging to Upananda, which was of rich colour. Two other Paribb\u00e1jakas told him that he had lost in the bargain, so he wished to cry off the deal, but Upananda positively refused (Vin.iii.240f). He did not, however, always come off best</p><p>in a bargain. Once he gave a robe to a colleague, on condition that the latter should join him in his tours. The condition was agreed to, but later, when the recipient monk heard that the Buddha was going on tour, he preferred to join the Buddha's company. The robe was not returned to Upananda, who had to be reported to the Buddha for the violent language he used to the defaulter (Vin.iii.254f). Upananda is mentioned", "as quarrelling with the Chabbaggiya monks (Vin.iv.30) and, at another time, as going his alms-rounds with a colleague with whom he quarrelled when the rounds were over, refusing to give him any of the food obtained. The unfortunate monk had to starve because it was then too late to go out begging again (Vin.iv.92f). We are not told whether Upananda deliberately set out to have a quarrel in order that he might keep all the food himself!</p><p>Nor were all Upananda's misdemeanours confined to greed for possessions. We are told that once a complaint was made to the Buddha that Upananda had gone to the house of an acquaintance and had sat down in the bedroom of the woman of the house, talking to her. The husband ordered food to be brought to Upananda, and when that was done, asked him to leave. But the woman wished him to stay and he refused to go away (Vin.iv.94).</p><p>On two other occasions he is mentioned as visiting the houses of his acquaintances and being found by the husbands, seated alone with their wives (Vin.iv.95-7; see also 121, 127 and 168, for other offences committed by him).</p><p>With most laymen, however, be was evidently popular. Mention is made of a meal where the donor kept all the other monks waiting for quite a long while, till Upananda should arrive, after his visits to various households (Vin.iv.98). And, again, of food being sent to the monastery with express instructions that the other monks should eat only after Upananda had done so (Vin.iv.99).</p><p>Episodes regarding Upananda's misdeeds are not confined to the Vinaya. In the Dabbhapuppha J\u00e1taka (J.iii.332ff; see also DhA.iii.139ff) we are told that he was in the habit of preaching contentment to others. When they, touched by his preaching, cast away their good robes, etc., Upananda collected them for himself. Once he cheated two brethren", "of a costly blanket. When the matter was brought to the Buddha's notice, this J\u00e1taka was related to show how in previous births, too, he had plundered other people's goods. He had been a jackal called M\u00e1y\u00e1v\u00ed, and had cheated two other jackals of a rohita-fish they had caught. Again, in the Samudda J\u00e1taka (J.ii.441f), he is described as a great eater and drinker; he would not be satisfied even with cart-loads of provisions. The J\u00e1taka tells of how he once was born as a water-crow and tried to prevent the fish from drinking the sea-water lest he should not have enough for himself. Buddhaghosa calls him a lolaj\u00e1tika, held in contempt by his eighty thousand fellow S\u00e1kyans who joined the Order (Sp.iii.665). Elsewhere he is referred to as a well-known example of one who never practised what he preached and, therefore, did not benefit by his cleverness.

On the last day of the fast, while Uttar\u00e1 was busy preparing alms for the Buddha, her husband, walking along with Sirim\u00e1, saw her working hard and smiled, thinking what a fool she was not to enjoy her wealth. Uttar\u00e1, seeing him, smiled at the thought of his folly in not making proper use of his wealth. Sirim\u00e1, thinking that husband and wife were smiling at each other, regardless of her presence, flew into a fury and, seizing a pot of boiling oil, threw it at Uttar\u00e1's head. But Uttar\u00e1 was at that time full of compassion for Sirim\u00e1, and the oil, therefore, did not hurt her at all. Sirim\u00e1, realising her grievous folly, begged forgiveness of Uttar\u00e1, who took her to the Buddha and related the whole story, asking that he should forgive her.
