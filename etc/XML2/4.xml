<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dasannaka Játaka (No.401)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was born as Senaka, a brahmin, counsellor to King Maddava of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. Maddava, seeing that his chaplain's son was yearning for his chief queen, gave her to him for a week. But at the end of the week the queen ran away with the youth and the king became ill with longing for her. Senaka thereupon arranged for a festival, in the course of which the king was shown a man swallowing a sword. The king then asked his counsellors, Ayura, Pukkusa and Senaka, if anything could be harder to do than that. They, in turn, replied that to promise a gift, to make it, and having made it, not to regret it, these acts were, in increasing degrees, far harder than swallowing a sword made in Dasanna. The king, grasping the purport of their answers, regained his self-composure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who was tempted by his former wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king was identified with the monk, Ayura with Moggallána, and Pukkusa with Sáriputta (J.iii.336-41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dvedhávitakka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Jetavana. The Buddha tells the monks how, before the Enlightenment, he divided his thoughts into two groups - the first being of pleasures of sense, of harm and of hurt, and the other thoughts of renunciation. He then proceeds to explain how this ultimately led to Enlightenment. M.i.114ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Devanagara&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called Devapura. A town at the southern point of Ceylon, the modern Dondra. An old vihára, repaired by Vijayabáhu I., existed there (Cv.lx.59). Devanagara is mentioned in the campaigns of Parakkamabáhu I. as a scene of conflict (Cv.lxxv.47). There was a temple at Devanagara built (by Dappulasena acc. to the Sinhalese poem Párákumbá-Sirita) in honour of the god Uppalavanna. Here Vírabáhu celebrated a sacrifice after his victory over the Jávakas (Cv.lxxxiii.49). Parakkamabáhu II. found the shrine in great decay and rebuilt it with great splendour, and inaugurated a festival which is celebrated every year, even up to the present day, in the month of Ásálha (Cv.lxxxv.85). Parakkamabáhu IV. built a long-shaped temple of two storeys for the recumbent image of the Buddha, which is found in the vihára (Cv.xc.94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He gave alms for many years to Maliyamahádeva Thera and the monks of Piyangudípa. Once, on his way to Suvannabhúmi, he was shipwrecked, but was rescued by Síhabáhu Thera and brought to Piyangudípa. There he saw Sakka and was provided with a ship full of valuables. The king having heard of him gave him Dantagáma. Ras.ii.191f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He lived in the Kalyánika-vihára and was known as the &quot;earth-shaker&quot; (pathavicálaka). He was among those who received a share of the meal given by Dutthagámani when the latter fled from Cúlanganiyapitthi. He shared his portion with five hundred others (Mhv.xxxii.50; xxiv.24ff). According to the Játaka Commentary (J.iv.490), he was among those who joined in the assemblies (samágama) known as Kuddalasamágama, Múgapakkhasamágama, Ayogharasamágama and Hatthipalasamágama. The Mahávamsa Tiká (p.606) mentions him as being one of those who accepted the meal of pork given by Sáliya and his wife, when they were blacksmiths, in their birth immediately preceding the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammagutta. A brother of Vedisadeví. He was one of the nobles who escorted the Bodhi-tree. He was made Moriyasetthi and given the Moriyajanapada by Devinampiyatissa.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dhammaruci&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dhammaruci.-One of the heterodox sects of Ceylon which branched off from the Theraváda (Mhv.v.13). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Nikáya Sangraha (p.11) this secession took place four hundred and fifty-four years after the death of the Buddha, and in the fifteenth year of the reign of Vattagámani Abhaya. The Nikáya Sangraha gives an account of the origin of this sect. A monk called Mahá-Tissa, incumbent of Abhayagiri, was convicted of living in domestic intercourse and expelled by the Mahávihára fraternity. He thereupon left with his followers and lived apart at Abhayagiri. They were strengthened by the arrival of some monks from Pallaráráma in South India, descendants of the Vajjiputtakas. Their teacher was Dhammaruci, and when they joined the Abhayagiri monks, Mahá-Tissa himself took the name of Dhammaruci and his followers became known as Dhammarucikas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávamsa Tíká (p.176) says that Dhammarucika was the name given to the monks of Abhayagiri when they seceded from the Mahávihára, and gives elsewhere (p.676f) the points on which they differed from the Theravádins. These points concerned minor teachings of the Vinaya. The Dhammarucikas became active in the time of Meghavannábhaya, and the king, after an enquiry into the matter, sent sixty of them into exile. They again became powerful in the time of Mahásena, through the influence of Sanghamitta, and almost succeeded in destroying the Mahávihára. But this disaster was averted by the intervention of the king's friend and counsellor, Meghavannábhaya, and Sanghamitta was killed by one of the queens (Mhv.xxxvii.17ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of Sanghamitta's untimely end, the Dhammarucikas seem to have enjoyed favour in Ceylon during a long period. </data>
<data>Dhátusena gave over to them the Ambatthala-vihára, which he built on Cetiyapabbata (Cv.xxxviii.75), and Kassapa I, bestowed on them the vihára he built in the Niyyanti garden, and made all provisions for their comfort (Cv.xxxix.17). Moggallána I, gave over to them the Dalha-vihára (Cv.xxxix.41) and Aggabodhi V. the Rájinádípika-vihára (Cv.xlviii.1). Sena Ilanga, general of Kassapa IV., built for them the Dhammáráma and the Hadayunha-parivena (Cv.lii.17, 18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ságaliyas were an offshoot of the Dhammarucikas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammaruci Thera.-An arahant. In the time of Dipankara Buddha he was a young man named Megha, and on hearing the Buddha's declaration regarding Sumedha, he entered the Order under the latter. But, owing to wrong association, he left the Order and murdered his mother. For this he suffered in Avíci and was later born as a fish. One day he heard some shipwrecked sailors calling on the name of Gotama Buddha for protection, and, remembering Dipankara's prophecy, the fish died. He was then born in Sávatthi, and hearing the Buddha preach at Jetavana, he entered the Order and became an arahant. Ap.ii.429f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dhammaruci.-A Nága king who gave grass to Atthadassí Buddha for his seat. BuA.178.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Ummagga Játaka contains a series of questions asked of King Vedeha by the goddess who lived in his parasol, because she wished to restore Mahosadha to the king's favour. Vedeha inquired of all his wise men, but they could find no answers, and, in the end, he was compelled to send for Mahosadha. The questions, in the nature of riddles, were put to him and he solved them all. vi.370f; the riddles with answers are found in pp.376f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The questions he asked of the Buddha on this occasion, and the answers given, are found in the Dhotakamánavapucchá. SN, p.204f; explained at SNA (ii.592f.) and also Chid. (19ff.). He became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a brahmin teacher named Chalanga, with a large following, and he built a bridge over the Bhagírathí for the Buddha and his monks to cross in comfort.

Dásaka Thera.-He was born in Sávatthi and was appointed by Anáthapindika to look after the vihára. There, being impressed by what he saw and heard, he entered the Order. Some say that he was the son of a slave-woman of Anáthapindika. The setthi was pleased with him and freed him that he might become a monk. It is said that in a previous birth he had ordered an arahant to do some work for him, hence his birth as a slave. From the time he was ordained he became slothful and fond of sleep. The Buddha admonished him, and, much agitated, he put forth effort and realised arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety-one kappas ago he met the Pacceka Buddha Ajita and gave him some beautiful mangoes to eat. Later, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, he was a monk (Thag.17; ThagA.i.68ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is this same Dásaka who is mentioned in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.iii.127ff; SA.ii.230) as having been sent by the monks of Kosambí to Khemaka, carrying messages to and fro till he had walked up and down over two yojanas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dásaka Thera.-Friend of Sonaka and pupil of Upáli. He was a learned brahmin of Vesáli, and, meeting Upáli at the Válikáráma, had a discussion with him, at the end of which he entered the Order for the purpose of studying the Doctrine. He learnt the whole of the Tipitaka and became an arahant. Later he ordained Sonaka, son of the caravan-guide, and teacher of Siggava and Candavajji. After Upáli's death, Dásaka became chief of the teachers of the Vinaya. Mhv.v.104ff; Dpv.iv.28ff; v.77ff; Vin.v.2; Sp.i.32, 235; but see Dvy.3ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His kingdom was captured by Brahmadatta, king of Kási, and he and his wife fled to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, where they lived in disguise in the house of a potter. His wife bore a son named Dígháyu (v.l. Dighávu). Before his birth, his mother had a craving to see the army drawn up in battle array, its swords tempered. Díghíti appeased her craving with the help of his friend, the chaplain of Brahmadatta. Dígháyu was sent away from the city lest harm should befall him, Later, Díghíti's place of refuge was discovered and he and his wife were being led to the place of execution when Digháyu, who was on a visit to the city, saw them. Díghíti, recognising his son, called to him his dying advice &quot;má dígham passa má rassam &quot; (look not too far nor too near). Dígháyu heard and understood; he entered the service of Brahmadatta, first as an elephant-trainer, then as a musician, and finally as his personal servant. He wished to avenge the death of his parents, but when the occasion arose, he remembered his father's instructions and desisted. Vin.i.342ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dakkhinávibhanga Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when the Buddha was staying at the Nigrodháráma in Kapilavatthu, Pajápatí Gotamí offered him two lengths of cloth woven by herself on her own loom. The Buddha asked her to present her gift to the Confraternity of monks rather than to him, for she would thereby gain greater merit. He then proceeded to describe the different kinds of recipients of gifts, the different kinds of givers and the degrees of purity in gifts (M.iii.253ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is found word for word in the Sútrálankára (Sylvan Levi: JA.1908, xx.99) and is often quoted.

The giver is glad at heart before making the gift, is satisfied while giving, and rejoices after the gift. The recipients are either free from lust, hatred and delusion, or are on the way to such freedom. The merit obtained from such a gift is infinite. A.iii.336f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dána Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Sáriputta, with the lay disciples of Campá, visits the Buddha at the Gaggarápokkharani and asks him why the same offerings have, in one case, no reward, in another, great reward. The Buddha explains in detail. A.iv.59ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Dána Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-On the eight kinds of alms. A.iv.236. (gr: A.VIII.31)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It had the sea on one side and a mountain on the other. The Andhakavenhudásaputtá tried to take it but in vain, because when the goblin, guarding the city, gave the alarm, the city would rise up in the air and settle on the sea till the enemy disappeared. They then sought Kanhadípáyana's advice and fixed the city down with chains. This enabled the Andhákavenhudásaputtá to capture it and make it their capital (J.iv.82ff). It was also the capital of King Sivi (J.vi.421). The Petavatthu and its Commentary (Pv.ii.9; PvA.113) speak of Dváravati as a city of Kamboja. It may be Kamsabhoja which is meant, the country of the Andhakavenhudásaputtá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dváravatí.-A city in the time of Siddhattha Buddha.

He was a chaplain's son, and the Buddha's first sermon was addressed to him and his friend Sudassana (J.i.38; BuA.168, 170). He is also called Sudeva (Bu.xiii.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Vohárikatissa heard him preach and restored for him five buildings (Mhv.xxxvi.29; Dpv.xxii.41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be the Thera whom Sanghatissa heard preaching the Andhakavinda Sutta. The king, being very pleased with him, set up an offering of gruel to the monks of the Mahávihára (Dpv.xxii 50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

Deva&lt;/b&gt;.-A Thera of Ceylon, who, according to the Gandhavamsa (Gv. p.63), wrote the Sumanakútavannaná. This work is, however, generally ascribed to Vedeha (P.L.C.223f; Svd.1263).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Deva.&lt;/b&gt;-Senápati of Kittisirimegha.

He took part in the campaigns against Gajabáhu, and later was sent to his rescue in Pulatthipura. Deva was imprisoned there, and Parakkamabáhu sent housebreakers </data>
<data>to release him, after which he was despatched with an army to Gangátatáka, where he defeated Mánábharana. At Hedillakhandagáma he defeated Mahinda. The last we hear of him is that he fell into his enemy's power at a village called Surulla. Parakkamabáhu went to rescue him, but had to abandon the effort. It is possible that he was ransomed and became Lankápura. (See below.) Cv.lxx.123, 153-7, 245, 285, 300, 316; lxxii.45, 75, 82, 122, 137f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Deva.&lt;/b&gt;-A general of Parakkamabáhu I., called Lankápura, probably identical with 9. He fought against Súkarabhátu, and later took part in the Sinhalese expedition to South India and fought in fierce battles at Tirippáluru and Rájiná, capturing the latter place. Cv.lxxv.130; lxxvi.250, 310, 324, 326.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Deva.&lt;/b&gt;-A minister of Áyasmanta. He was sent to erect a vihára at Valligáma. Cv.lxxx.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="12"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;.

MT.324; Sp.i.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Deva. &lt;/b&gt;A minister of Devagáma. He once gave food to a starving dog. He was reborn in the same village, and later entered the Order at Pupphavása Vihára. During the Bráhmanatiya famine a tree deity looked after him for twelve years. Once men looking for food wished to kill him, but he was saved by his luck. He became an arahant, and the deity looked after him for twelve years more.

The left eye-tooth of the Buddha was in Dantapura until taken to Ceylon by Dantákumára.

Geiger (Cv.Trs.i.67, n.8) thinks he probably held some sort of position in the king's court, corresponding to that of a purohita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dáthásiva.-Minister of Jetthatissa III. He was captured by the forces of Aggabodhi III. at Máyetti, but later regained his freedom and was sent by Jetthatissa to India to cut off Aggabodhi's rearward communications. When Jetthatissa committed suicide and Aggabodhi was once more king, Dáthásiva returned to Ceylon, defeated Aggabodhi and became king as Dáthopatissa. But his reign was insecure and he was constantly having to flee. He was very rapacious and plundered the temples. Later, to make amends, he built the Sákavatthu-vihára and restored the Thúpáráma. In the end he fled to India from Kassapa II., but returned later and fought a battle in which he was killed (Cv.xliv.128ff). He had a nephew, Hatthadátha (Cv.xliv.155), who became known as Bhágineyya-Dáthopatissa. The prince Bodhi and the princess Lokitá were descendants of Dáthopatissa (Cv.lvii.40).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dáthásiva. A thera, resident of Nágasálá; he was very learned and held in great esteem by Aggabodhi IV (Cv.xlvi.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Dáthásiva.-Uparájá of Aggabodhi IV. He was captured and imprisoned by Potthakuttha. Cv.xlvi.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Dáthásiva.-An ádipáda, ruler of Rohana.

It was so called from the relation of its position to that of Anurádhapura. At one time it was united with the Malayarattha and formed part of the territory governed by the king's second son (E.g., Cv.xli.35; but see Cv.Trs.i.54, n.4). Later, it seems to have become the special province of the heir-apparent (E.g., Cv.xliii.8; xliv.84; lxv.23; lxviii.33; li.12, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also referred to as Dakkhinapassa (E.g., Cv.lviii.41) and Dakkhinabhága.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the strongholds of Dakkhinadesa are mentioned Muhunnaru, Badalatthala, Vápinágara, Buddhagáma, Tilagulla, Mahágalla and Mandagalla (Cv.lviii.42), and among its villages, Punkhagáma (Cv.lxi.42) and Bodhisenapabbata (Cv.lxi.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The building was evidently attached to the palace &quot;in royal territory,&quot; and was originally erected by Devánampiyatissa, its name then being Dhammacakka (Cv.xxxvii.95f). Dhátusena restored it (Cv.xxxviii.70), while Aggabodhi I. beautified it with various decorations (Cv.xlii.33). It was burnt by the Colas, but was rebuilt by Mahinda IV.

It was originally inhabited by monks from the Abhayagiri-vihára, but later there was a schism by the Dakkhinaviháraká, as the monks of the Dakkhina-vihára were called (Mhv.xxxiii.98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amandagamaní-Abhaya built for the monastery the Mahágámenditank (Mhv.xxxv.5), while Kanitthatissaka added a mantling to the thúpa and built a refectory on some land on the boundary of the Mahámeghavana; he also constructed a road to the vihára, and moved on to one side the wall of the Mahávihára in order to do this (Mhv.xxxvi.12f). Voháraka-Tissa erected a wall round the monastery (Mhv.vs.35) and Gothábhaya restored the uposatha hall (Mhv.vs.107). The thera Tissa, for whom Mahásena built the Jetavana-vihára, was an incumbent of Dakkhina-vihára, in this context called Dakkhináráma (Mhv.xxxvii.32). Aggabodhi I. erected a splendid pásáda in the vihára (Cv.xlii.14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vihára is generally identified with what is now known as Elára's tomb (But see Cv.Trs.i.66, n.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Dígha.-A Yakkha chieftain whose help should be sought by followers of the Buddha, when in distress (D.iii.205). The Buddha says (M.i.201f ) that Digha once visited him and spoke to him of the wonderful attainments of Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila, and remarked how fortunate were the Vajjians that these three were dwelling in the Vajji country. Buddhaghosa (MA.i.431) describes Digha as a devarájá and says that his other name was Parajana. His visit to the Buddha was at Gosingasálavana, just before the Buddha left to see Anuruddha and the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dígha.-A thera of Ceylon, and an expert in the Vinaya. Vin.v.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dígha.-A brahmin. He found he could not satisfy other brahmins, even though he gave five bowls of food to each. One day he went to the vihára, and, in order to test the monks, served them with only one vessel of rice. Thirty monks partook of it and Dígha was pleased with their great moderation. AA.i.262f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Devasabha Thera.-An arahant. He was a Sákiyan of Kapilavatthu. He witnessed the Buddha settle the quarrel between the Sákiyans and the Koliyans and was established in the Refuges. Later he visited the Buddha at the Nigrodháráma and entered the Order, afterwards attaining arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhí Buddha he was a householder and offered the Buddha bandhujívaka-flowers. Seven kappas ago he was a king named Samantacakkhu (Thag.v.100; ThagA.i.203f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Bandhujívaka of the Apadána.

A.iii.344ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dhammika Sutta.-Dhammika Thera is driven out by the lay disciples of seven settlements in succession, because he insulted and reviled visiting monks. He, thereupon, seeks the Buddha at Gijjhakúta and reports the matter to him. The Buddha relates to him a story of the past connected with the observance of Rukkha-dhamma, and exhorts him to observe the dhamma of a recluse. He also tells Dhammika of various teachers of the past whose disciples, by accepting their teaching, were born in happy states. A.iii.366ff; the teachers are Sunetta, Múgapakkha, Aranemi, Kuddálaka and Jotipála. These names occur in the Játakas; see for details. Perhaps the stories were pre-Buddhistic. Compare the list with that at A.iv.135, where the name of Araka is added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammika Sutta.-Dhammika Upásaka, with five hundred others, visits the Buddha at Jetavana, singing his praises and asking what should be the life of a monk and what that of a householder. The Buddha proceeds to lay down the course of conduct to be followed by a monk and the virtues to be cultivated by a layman (SN.vv.376-404).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds (SNA.i.367f) that these upásakas were all anágámíns who, on the day in question, had taken the uposatha vows. During the middle watch the question of the difference between the life of a monk and that of a layman occurred to them and they sought the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

But Dhammáráma dwelt apart, meditating. This was reported to the Buddha and, on being questioned, Dhammáráma confessed that he wished to become an arahant while yet the Buddha was alive.

Dhammika Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin of Kosala who was converted at the presentation of Jetavana and entered a village vihára. As he became irritated when monks visited the vihára they desisted, and he became sole master of the vihára. When this was reported to the Buddha by a layman, the Buddha sent for him and preached to him the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rukkhadhamma_jat_074')"&gt;Rukkhadhamma Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, showing that in the past, too, he had been guilty of similar conduct. Dhammika concentrated on the verses of the Játaka and, developing insight, became an arahant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhí Buddha he had been a hunter and had listened to the Buddha preaching to an assembly of the gods in a forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thag.303-6; ThagA.i.396ff. According to A.iii.366ff. Dhammika had to leave seven lodgings, one after the other, because the lay supporters of the lodgings could not tolerate his insulting ways. He therefore sought the Buddha and complained to him. The Rukkhadhamma Játaka mentioned here is evidently not the story of the same name mentioned in the Játaka Commentary (i.327ff.). The story is given in full in the Anguttara Nikáya (loc. cit.). There the Buddha is said to have related to him stories of several past teachers, showing the evil effects of reviling others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He may be identical with Ghosasaññaka of the Apadána (Ap.ii.451).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dhammika.&lt;/b&gt;-A householder of Sávatthi who led a very holy life. One day he felt the wish to become a monk and spoke of it to his wife, but she begged him to wait until after the birth of their child. He waited till the child was able to walk and, then spoke again to her, but she then wished him to wait until the child should be of age. To this he would not </data>
<data>agree, but joined the Order and soon after became an arahant. Later, he visited his family and preached to his son, who became a monk and attained arahantship. His mother, left alone, joined the nuns, becoming an arahant herself. DhA.ii.157-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Dhammika.&lt;/b&gt;-An eminent lay disciple of Sávatthi, a very learned man and an anágámí. He had five hundred followers, all anágámí, who, like himself, could travel through the air (SNA.i.367). He was one of those who possessed sekhapatisambhidá (Vsm.442; VibhA.388). See also &lt;a href="dhammika_v_s')"&gt;Dhammika Sutta 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Dhammika&lt;/b&gt;.-One of the chief lay supporters of Piyadassí Buddha. Bu.xiv.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Dhammika.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Siam, contemporary of Kittisirirájasíha of Ceylon. He welcomed the delegation sent from Ceylon to Siam to bring back some monks, and gave it every help. On two occasions he sent groups of monks to Ceylon to re-establish ordination in that country, and the king of Ceylon, to show his gratitude, sent him a replica of the Tooth Relic and various other gifts. Cv.c.66, 136, 151, 157.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. Dhammika.&lt;/b&gt;-See DhA.i.129ff. The &quot;dhammika upásaka&quot; mentioned there is probably merely &quot;a righteous lay disciple&quot; and not an upásaka &quot;named Dhammika.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Dhammika.&lt;/b&gt;-Name of a jackal in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bilara_jat_128')"&gt;Bilára Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Vin.i.342ff; J.iii.487).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is stated in the Játaka that the full story is given in the Sanghabhedaka Játaka. No such story is, however, to be found, unless this is another name for the Kosambí Játaka.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Díghíti was related in reference to the quarrelsome monks of Kosambí. Some of the stanzas found in the Játaka story are repeated in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upakkilesa_s')"&gt;Upakkilesa Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.154).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He once visited the Buddha at Nálandá, and there followed a discussion on actions and their efficiency. Díghatapassí reported this discussion to Nátaputta and Upáli, who was listening, went, against the advice of Díghatapassí, to the Buddha and challenged him to a discussion, at the end of which Upáli was converted (M.i.371ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (MA.ii.594) says that Díghatapassí was long-limbed, hence his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was deeply impressed by the silence surrounding the Buddha and, falling at his feet, he kissed them and showed great reverence. On being asked by the Buddha why he did so, the king replied that he perceived the marvellous effects of the Buddha's teaching on his disciples. They were well controlled, yet joyful, buoyant, with hearts as free as those of wild creatures; and he added that he knew of no such discipline outside the Buddha's teaching. He then proceeded to tell the Buddha of his own servants, Isidatta and Purána, and of their great devotion to the Buddha, reminding the Buddha that they were both Kosalan nobles of about the same age. On the king's departure, the Buddha commended the king's words to the monks, asking them to remember them, for they formed a monument (cetiya) to the results of the Dhamma.

Then Sakka came up and showed great humility before the yakkha, and the greater his humility the uglier did the yakkha become, until he disappeared. S.i.237.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once, while travelling, they came to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and there, while resting in the king's garden, Brahmadatta fell asleep and Darímukha, who perceived certain omens which foretold kingship for his friend, left him, and having become a Pacceka Buddha, retired to Nandamúlaguhá. Brahmadatta became king of Benares and, in his glory, forgot Darímukha for many, many years. When fifty years had passed Darímukha visited the king and preached to him on Renunciation. Later, Brahmadatta also became an ascetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Buddha's Renunciation. J.iii.238-46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On the Buddha's departure the monks gather round Sáriputta and ask him how the Buddha expects them to cultivate the inner life with the same aloofness as does the Buddha himself, and Sáriputta delivers a discourse (M.i.12ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is often referred to (E.g., Mil.242; Sp.iii.694) as teaching the virtues of contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Dhammaddhaja Játaka (No.220).&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta was once born as Dhammaddhaja, chaplain to Yasapáni, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. One day the king's captain, Kálaka, who was wont to take bribes, gave a wrong decision in a case, and the Bodhisatta, being appealed to, reheard the case and decided in the plaintiff's favour. The people applauded greatly and the king made him judge. But Kálaka, wishing for an excuse to put Dhammaddhaja to death, persuaded the king that he was getting too popular, and the king gave him various impossible tasks. Dhammaddhaja, with the help of Sakka, performed them all. One day the king ordered him to find a park-keeper with four virtues, and once again, with the aid of Sakka, the Bodhisatta discovered Chattapáni, the king's barber. On being questioned, Chattapáni told the king that he was free from envy, drank no wine, had no strong desires, never gave way to anger; he then related stories of his past lives, the experiences of which had made him renounce these evils. (For details see Chattapáni 2). The king, at length, discovered Kálaka's perfidy and had him put to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka was related in reference to Devadatta's attempts to kill the Buddha. Devadatta is identified with Kálaka and Sáriputta with Chattapáni. J.ii.186-96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dhammaddhaja Játaka (No.384).-&lt;/b&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as leader of a flock of birds on an island. Certain merchants of Benares started on a voyage taking with them, to aid them on the way, a much travelled crow. The ship was wrecked and the crow flew to the island.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Devadhamma Játaka (No.6)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was born as Mahimsása, son of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. His brother was Canda and his stepbrother Suriya. Suriya's mother, having been granted a boon, claimed for him the kingdom. Mahimsása and Canda thereupon went into exile, but they were accompanied by Suriya. Arrived in Himavá, Mahimsása sent his two brothers to fetch water from a pool. There, first Suriya and then Canda, were seized by a demon who had been allowed by Vessavana to eat anyone entering the pond, provided he did not know the Devadhamma. Mahimsása then went himself to the pond, and on being questioned by the demon, preached to him the Devadhamma - which is to shrink from sin. The demon was pleased, and offered to release one of his victims. Mahimsása chose Suriya, and gave as his reason that he was afraid of being blamed by others. Thereupon the demon gave up both his brothers and showed the Bodhisatta great honour. The Bodhisatta converted him and he gave up his evil ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a rich man of Sávatthi who joined the Order after his wife's death. But he continued to enjoy all kinds of luxuries until, arraigned before the Buddha, he pulled off his robes and stood only in his waist-cloth. The Buddha told him it was not the first time he had had to show him the error of his ways. He is identified with the water demon, Ananda with Suriya, and Sáriputta with Canda (J.i.126ff; DhA.iii.74-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nacca Játaka was preached in reference to the same monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Bherí persuaded the king to make this declaration in public, so that Mahosadha's glory might be spread far and wide. J.vi.469ff., 477, 478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

D.ii.235f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Dhatarattha.&lt;/b&gt;-A &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga')"&gt;Nága&lt;/a&gt; king. Thanks to the scheming of the tortoise Cittacúla, he married Samuddajá, daughter of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. They had four sons: Sudassana, Bhúridatta, Subhaga and Kánárittha. His kingdom was beneath the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamunaa')"&gt;Yamuná&lt;/a&gt;. Dhatarattha is identified with Suddhodana. J.vi.162ff., 171.186, 200, 219. For details see the </data>

Dhatarattha.&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta born as king of the hamsas. He lived in Cittakúta, at the head of ninety thousand hamsas. One day he was caught in a snare on the lake Khemá, set by the orders of King Bahuputtaka. Dhatarattha's friend, Sumukha, refused to leave him while he was caught. The two friends melted the heart of the hunter when he came to take Dhatarattha, and later they were brought before the king. Dhatarattha preached the Doctrine to the king and to his queen, Khemá, who longed to hear a hamsa preach (J.iv.425ff; for details see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hamsa_jat_502')"&gt;Hamsa Játaka&lt;/a&gt;). Dhatarattha is often referred toe as a king surrounded by a splendid following. E.g., DA.i.40; MA.ii.576; UdA.57, 412; PvA.171.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Dhatarattha.&lt;/b&gt;-The family of hamsas to which belonged Dhatarattha, king of the hamsas. The members of this family are called Dhataratthá. They were golden-coloured and lived in Cittakúta. The Mahá-Sutasoma Játaka (J.v.345, 355, 357) contains a story of the complete destruction of these hamsas. They lived in Kañcanaguhá, and during the four months of the rainy season would not leave their cave, in case their wings should be drenched with water and they fell into the sea. A spider, as big as a cartwheel, used to weave a thick web at the entrance to the cave, but the Dhatarattha geese sent one of their young ones, who had received two portions of food, to cut through the web. One season, however, the rains lasted for four months, and the hamsas became cannibals and thus lost their strength. When, at the end of the rains, they tried to break through the web, they failed, and the spider cut off their heads one by one and drank their blood. This was the end of the Dhatarattha hamsas. J.v.469f.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

Perhaps he is the heretic brahmin, nephew of Sáriputta, who was admonished by Moggallána because he expressed great repugnance at the sight of Kassapa.

Once when the Buddha was ill with cramp and desired hot water Upavána obtained from Devahita hot water and molasses, which he sent on a pingo by a serving man. Hot fomentations and the administering of molasses cured the Buddha's complaint. Devahita came later to the Buddha, and after some conversation he was converted (S.i.174f; DhA.iv.232). Devahita was said to be a friend of Upavána (ThagA.i.311f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.201) adds that Devahita earned his living from the provision of water heated on his row of ovens and of cosmetics for those who came to bathe. On hearing of the Buddha's illness, he gave to Upavána a kind of treacle to be administered in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Devánampiyatissa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (247-207 B.C.). He was the second son of Mutasíva. It is said that on the day of his coronation many wonderful treasures miraculously appeared, some of which he resolved to send as tokens of esteem to his contemporary &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka')"&gt;Dhammásoka&lt;/a&gt; of India, with whom he had long been on terms of friendship. An embassy, led by his nephew Mahárittha, was despatched to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama')"&gt;Pátaliputta&lt;/a&gt;, and the emperor showed the ambassadors every mark of honour. He sent back with them all the requisites for a coronation, with instructions to celebrate the inauguration of the Sinhalese king, whom he invited to embrace Buddhism. On the return of the embassy, the king was solemnly crowned a second time. This confirmation of Devánampiyatissa's sovereignty under the aegis of Asoka may have been due either to the commanding position of Asoka or for the strengthening of family connections. Asoka was a Moriyan (a branch of the Sákiyans) and Devánampiyatissa had Sákiyan blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief event in the reign of Devánampiyatissa was the arrival of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mahinda')"&gt;Mahinda&lt;/a&gt; in Ceylon. He arrived at the head of a mission in the year of the king's second coronation. Mahinda met the king hunting on the full-moon day of Jettha. The king welcomed him with great honour and speedily embraced the new religion, to which Asoka had already drawn his attention.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His conversion was the direct result of Mahinda's preaching of the Cúlahatthipadopama Sutta. His earlier religion is not known, it may have been Jainism. His example was followed by a large number of his subjects, many of whom entered the Order. Devánampiyatissa dedicated to their use the Nandana park </data>
<data>and the Mahámeghavana, which he himself had laid out a little earlier. In the Mahámeghavana he built the famous Mahá-Vihára which, for many centuries, remained the centre of the orthodox religion in Ceylon. The dedication of the Mahá-Vihára took place in the two hundred and thirty-sixth year after the death of the Buddha. The king's next pious work was the erection of the Cetiyapabbata-vihára and he, later, built the Thúpáráma, containing the Buddha's right collar-bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the women of the palace, led by Anulá, wife of the sub-king, Mahánága, expressed a desire to become nuns, Devánampiyatissa sent another embassy to Asoka asking him to send Sanghamittá, together with the right branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree. This branch miraculously severed itself from the parent tree and, together with Sanghamittá, was conveyed down the Ganges and arrived in Jambukola, where it was received with all honour by Devánampiyatissa. From Jambukola it was taken in procession to Anurádhapura, where it was planted in the Mahámeghavana, the king instituting in its honour a festival, which was observed for many centuries. For the use of Sanghamittá and the nuns the king erected various buildings, the chief of which was the Hatthálhaka-vihára and the Upásiká-vihára with its twelve mansions. (This account is summarised from the Mahávamsa (chaps.xi., xiii.-xx.); also Dpv.xi.14ff; xii.7; xvii.92).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other works of Devánampiyatissa we are told of the building of the Issarasamana- and the Vessagiri-viháras, the refectory called Mahápáli, the Jambukola-vihára in Nágadípa, the Tissamahá-vihára, the Pácínáráma and the Pathamathúpa. He also built the Tissavápi at Anurádhapura. (The Cv. (xxxvii.94) mentions also the Dhammacakka as having been built by Devánampiyatissa. It later became the Temple of the Tooth at Anurádhapura).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda survived him by eight years. </data>

If he threw it up into the sky, no rain would fall for twelve years; if he let it fall on the earth, all plants and trees would die and nothing would grow for twelve years; if he threw it into the sea, the sea would completely dry up; it could make Sineru crumble into pieces. Álavaka hurled it at the Buddha, but it fell at the Buddha's feet and remained there as a rug.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also called Vatthávudha, and was evidently made of cloth (SNA.i.225f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was very dainty as to food, and spent so much on it that he came to be known as Bhojanasuddhika (Dainty-food). He always ate in a decorated pavilion in full view of his people. One day, a greedy man seeing him eat and wishing to taste the food, rushed up to him with clasped hands, saying that he was a messenger (dúta), messengers having free access to the king. Approaching the table, he snatched some food and thrust it into his mouth. The king's attendants wished to behead him, but the king invited him to share his meal, and, at the conclusion, enquired as to his message. He said he was the messenger of Lust and of the Belly, and told the king how great was the power of these two. The king was pleased with him and gave him one thousand cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a greedy monk. J.ii.318-21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dúta Játaka (No.478).&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta was once a brahmin of Kási. He studied at Takkasilá, and wandered about begging for gold to pay his teacher. He collected a few ounces, but on his way back he was forced to cross the Ganges, and the gold fell into the river. He then thought out a plan and sat fasting on the bank of the river, refusing to speak to anybody until the king of Benares himself came. To him he told his story, pointing out that it would have been useless to tell the others, they being unable to help him. The king gave him twice the original quantity of gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a discussion by the monks as to the Buddha's great resourcefulness.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dandanáyakabhátaro&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two brothers, Kitti and Sankhadhátu, generals of Parakkamabáhu 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitti was made chief of the Kesadhátus and Sankhadhátu was made a Nagaragalla. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These honours won from them their allegiance to the king. They took an active part in Parakkamabáhu's campaign against Gajabáhu (Cv.lxx.279, 284, 293, 301) and also in his wars waged for the unification of the country.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Devadúta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deals with the three warning messengers of death - the sight of old age, the sight of illness and the sight of death. The man who fails to pay heed to these messengers and is guilty of unrighteousness is condemned by Yama to the tortures of the Mahánirayas, which are described in detail (A.i.138f; cp. Makhádeva Játaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same sutta, with several variations, is given at greater length in the Majjhima Nikáya (M.iii.178ff), where five messengers are spoken of, the first and fourth being the sight of a new-born babe and the sight of a guilty robber being punished for his offences respectively. The sutta is referred to for a description of Avíci (DhA.i.107; also AA.i.21). It was preached by Mahádeva to the people of Mahisamandala (Mhv.xii.29; Mbv.114), and by Mahinda at Anurádhapura, on the first day of the latter's arrival there, when one thousand people became sotápannas (Mhv.xiv.63).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhima version of the sutta is given (E.g., MA.i.135) as an example of a discourse where the Buddha starts the sermon with a simile and then preaches the Doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Díghavápi&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tank and a district in Ceylon. When the Buddha went to Ceylon he visited the village, and on the spot where he sat in meditation a cetiya was later erected (Mhv.i.78; Dpv.ii.60; Sp.i.89). It seems to have been the central post in the country lying between the Tamil kingdom and the province of Rohana. Thus we find Dutthagámani's brother, Tissa, occupying it by the order of his father. Later, on the death of his father, he retired to Díghavápi with his mother and the elephant Kandula (Mhv.xxiv.2, 14f, 48). When he made peace with his brother, he was again sent there to look after the district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the conquest of the Tamils, Tissa was again in charge of Díghavápi, for we find him being sent for from there at the time of Dutthagámani's death (Mhv.xxxii.2). Tissa (afterwards called Saddhátissa) founded the Díghavápi-vihára, in connection with which he built a cetiya, to which he made valuable offerings (Mhv.xxxiii.9, 14). We hear of Díghavápi in connection with the campaigns of Parakkamabáhu I. (Cv.lxxiv.89; 98, 110, 180; lxxv.1, 10). Many years later Rájasíha II. gave the district round Díghavápi to the settlers who came from Holland (Cv.xcvi.25, 28; for its identification see Cv.Trs.ii.30, n.1). The village of Mahámuni, residence of Sumaná, wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, was in Díghavápi (DhA.iv.50). Díghavápi was nine leagues from Tissamaháráma (AA.i.386).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a story connected with the cetiya see Dhajagga Paritta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dhánañjáni (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dhánañjáni (v.l. Dhánañjáni).-A brahmin of Tandulapáladvára in Rájagaha. He was a minister of the king and oppressed the people in order to get rich. Sáriputta, hearing of his fall from the ways of earnestness - after the death of his first pious wife and his marriage to another - visited Dhánañjáni and pointed out to him that if he departed from equity and righteousness he could not hope to be excused on the plea that his fall was due to force of circumstances. Dhánañjáni profited by the discourse, and later, when he was ill, he sent word to Sáriputta, told him of his dire illness, and expressed his wish to be born in one of the Brahma-worlds. Sáriputta taught how union with Brahmá could be attained. Soon after, Dhánañjáni died, and the Buddha said that he was born in one of the lower Brahma-worlds. M.ii.184ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhánañjáni.-A brahminee, probably of Rájagaha. She was married to a brahmin of the Bháradvája-gotta. One day, while serving her husband's dinner, she sang the praises of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Order. The brahmin, very annoyed, threatens to go to the Buddha and abuse him. His wife encourages him to go. He goes, has a discussion with the Buddha, and is converted. Later, he joins the Order and, in due course, becomes an arahant (S.i.159f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.175ff) the brahminee was a sotápanna and that she would constantly sing the praises of the Buddha while engaged in her duties and that the brahmin closed his ears to it. One day he invited a large number of his friends to a banquet, and, on the eve of the great day, asked her to promise not to offend his brahmin friends by her udána. She refused to give any such promise, even when he threatened to cut her </data>
<data>with a dagger. She declared herself ready to suffer, and sang five hundred verses on her theme. The brahmin surrendered. While waiting on the guests, her impulse became too great for her, and, laying down bowl and spoon, she started repeating her song of praise. The scandalised guests hurried away, spitting out the food, defiled by the presence of a heretic, and her husband scolded her for the spoiled feast. She may be the woman who was responsible for the visit of Sangárava (q.v.) to the Buddha. The latter is, however, stated to have lived in Candalakappa (M.ii.209).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dhánañjáni.-Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.175) that this was the name of a brahmin clan of great pride of birth, claiming descent from the head of Brahma, whereas the other brahmins were born from his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dánañjáni Sutta.-Records the story of Dhánañjáni of Tandulapáladvára (q.v.). S.ii.184ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhánañjáni Sutta.-Records the story of how Bháradvája, husband of the brahminee Dhánañjáni (q.v.), became an arahant. S.i.159ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dhanuggaha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man, who can simultaneously seize the arrows shot by four expert bowmen from the four quarters, is possessed of great speed. Far speedier than he are the sun and the moon, but the change taking place in all things surpasses all these in speed (S.i.265).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems also to have been called the Dalhadhamma Sutta. E. g., at J.iv.211.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There he lived in a constant state of terror until the Bodhisatta, who was a tree-sprite, dispelled his fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who was always in fear of death. He is identified with the elephant. J.i.414-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was present at the discussion of the Nigantha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saccaka')"&gt;Saccaka&lt;/a&gt; with the Buddha, and seeing Saccaka discomfited in the debate, Dummukha compared him to a crab pulled out of a pond and ill-treated by village boys (M.i.234).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says (MA.i.459) that Dummukha just happened to be his name. He was in reality quite handsome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dummukha.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Kampilla in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarapancaala')"&gt;Uttarapañcála&lt;/a&gt;. One day, while looking from his window down on to the palace yard, he saw several bulls setting upon a cow in lust, and one bull, stronger than the rest, killed another with his horns. The king, realizing the evil nature of lust, entered into a trance and became a Pacceka Buddha. J.iii.379, 381.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Damila&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a people (Tamils) whose home was in South India. The Ceylon Chronicles (Mhv., Cv., and Dpv., passim) contain records of invasions of Ceylon by the Damilas, the most noteworthy being that which was repelled by Dutthagámani. The Damila leader on that occasion was Elára. Other Damilas mentioned by name in the Mahávamsa are Sena, Gutta, Pulahattha, Vatuka and Niliya. Large numbers of Damilas settled in Ceylon, chiefly in the north and east of the Island and, in due course, gained possession of that part of the country. They were employed as mercenary soldiers by some of the Sinhalese kings and many were brought as captives (E.g., Cv.lxx.230; lxxv.20, 69; lxxviii.76, etc.). The Damila bhásá is mentioned among the eighteen non-Aryan languages (E.g., VibhA.388; it was full of consonants, AA.i.409). In the Akitti Játaka (J.iv.238) the Damilarattha is spoken of as including also the region round Kávírapattana, while in the Petavatthu Commentary (p.133) it is spoken of as part of Dakkhinapátha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dasanna&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country in Central India. Rujá was once born as an ox there (J.vi.238). It was apparently a centre of the art of sword-making  (J.iii.338). Erakaccha, a city in Dasanna, was the residence of the setthi Dhanapála (Pv.ii.7). The kings of Dasanna are called Dasanná. Dasanna is mentioned in the Mahávastu (i.34) as one of the sixteen mahájanapadas, and also in the Mahábhárata (ii.5-10) and the Meghadúta (24-5). It is generally identified with Vidisá or the Bhilsa region in the Central Provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dhammasonda&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta born as king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. He was so called because, at the time of his birth, all beings were filled with a desire for righteousness. The religion of Kassapa Buddha had disappeared, and D. was unable to get anyone to preach the Dhamma to him. He therefore left the kingdom and entered the forest. By his virtue Sakka's throne was heated, and Sakka, coming down as a Rakkhasa, agreed to preach to D. if he would allow himself to be eaten. D. consented, and, climbing a rock three gávutas high, threw himself into the Rakkhasa's mouth, listening to his preaching as he fell. Sakka then revealed his identity, took him to the deva-world and taught him a stanza on impermanence, which had been spoken by Kassapa. Ras.i.2f.; the story is very popular in Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The king insulted him and sent him, together with Vágissara, back to Ceylon in a leaky ship. Cv.lxxvi.32ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammakitti.-A monk of Tambarattha. Parakkamabáhu II., hearing of his great virtues and holiness, sent him offerings of piety, inviting him to Ceylon. The Elder came and was much honoured by the king (Cv.lxxxiv.11). It is commonly believed (E.g., J.R.A.S., 1896, pp.202ff) that this was the monk who wrote the continuation of the Mahávamsa (the Cúlavamsa) dealing with the period from the reign of Mahásena to that of Parakkamabáhu II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dhammakitti.-A thera in the time of Viravikkama (circa 1542). The king appointed him head of the Order and held the ceremony of ordination under him. Cv.xcii.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Dhammakitti.-Author of the Dáthávamsa. He wrote this book in the reign of Lílávati, at the request of her minister Parakkama, who was his patron. Dhammakitti speaks of himself as a pupil of Sáriputta (of Pulatthipura) (P.L.C.207f; Gv.62, 67). He is perhaps, identical with Dhammakitti I. P.L.C.215.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Dhammakitti.-A thera of Ceylon, author of the Sinhalese prose work, the Saddharmálankára, in the fourteenth century, which is an enlarged translation of the Rasaváhiní. He was Sangharája in the time of Bhuvanekabáhu V. His teacher was also called Dhammakitti and was a member of the Putabhattasela fraternity. This teacher was probably the author of the Páli poem the Párámímahásataka. In addition to the Saddharmálankára, his pupil wrote several other works, the Sankhepa, the Jinabodhávalí and the Bálávatára; also the Sinhalese chronicle, the Nikáyasangraha. P.L.C.226, 240, </data>
<data>243.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Dhammakitti.-Called Dhammakitti Mahásámi, author of the Saddhamasangaha. His teacher was also called Dhammakitti, well-known in Ceylon. Dhammakitti Mahásámi came to Ceylon from Yodhapura (Ayojjha?) and, having acquired much merit, returned there, where he lived in the Lankáráma, built by Paramarája.

A.iv.27-39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Devatá Samyutta.&lt;/b&gt;-First division of the Samyutta Nikáya. It contains records of visits paid to the Buddha by various deities and the conversations which ensued. S.i.1-45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devatá Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A devatá visits the Buddha at Jetavana and tells him of six things necessary for a monk's spiritual development: reverence for the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, reverence for the discipline, grace in speech and good friendship. The Buddha reports this visit to the monks, and Sáriputta explains why these particular qualities were mentioned by the devatá. A.iii.423.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devatá Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The Buddha tells the monks how, on various occasions, devas had visited him and told him that they bad felt remorse after their death because they had not honoured recluses during their life as human beings. Others who had honoured recluses had obtained happiness. A.iv.390f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was a brahmin of Avanti and studied in Takkasilá. While returning from there after completing his studies, he saw a monk dwelling apart and, having heard the Dhamma from him, entered the Order and became an arahant. We are told that one day, while meditating, he saw two novices climbing a tree in the vihára to pick flowers. The bough broke and they fell, but he, with his iddhi-power, caught them and put them down unhurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Atthadassí Buddha he gave to the Buddha a pilakkha-fruit (Thag.vs.203f; ThagA.i.326f). He is probably identical with Pilakkhaphaladáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.298.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dhammapála.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin, son of the Bodhisatta.

For his story see the Mahá-Dhammapála Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Dhammapála&lt;/b&gt;.-The Bodhisatta born as the son of King Mahápatápa. For his story see the Culla-Dhammapála Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Dhammapála.&lt;/b&gt;-A name given to Vidhurapandita. J.vi.289, 291.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Dhammapála Kumára.&lt;/b&gt;-The son of Vidhurapandita (q.v.). He is identified with Ráhula. J.vi.290, 300, 329.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Dhammapála.&lt;/b&gt;-The name of the family (kula) of Dhammapála, and the village in Kási where he lived (J.iv.50; PvA.61). See the Mahá-Dhammapála Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Dhammapála.&lt;/b&gt;-A celebrated author, generally referred to as Ácariya. Various works are attributed to him, but as there seem to have been several authors of the same name (Gv. (p.66f.) mentions </data>
<data>four), it is difficult to assign their works separately. The best known, distinguished by the name of Ácariya, is said (Gv. p.69) to have written fourteen books. The Sásanavamsa (p.33) records that he lived at Badaratittha in South India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His works show that he was a native of Káñcipura. His period is uncertain, though it is generally agreed that he is posterior to Buddhaghosa. He seems to have studied in the Mahávihára, because he mentions this fact in the introduction to his books (e.g., the Petavatthu Commentary). It is quite likely that he studied the Tamil Commentaries as well and that he wrote at Badaratittha. (Hiouen Thsang, Beal.ii.229, says that Dhammapála was a clever youth of Káñcipura and that the king gave him his daughter. But Dhammapála, not wishing to marry, prayed before an image of the Buddha. The gods took him to a place far away where he was ordained by the monks). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Khuddaka Nikáya was his chief study, and seven of his works are commentaries on the books of poetry preserved in the Canon - the Thera- and Theri-Gáthá, Udána, Vimána- and Peta-Vatthu, Itivuttaka and Cariyápitaka. His other works are a commentary on the Netti, and on the Visuddhi-magga (called the Paramatthamañjúsá), tíkás (called Línatthavannaná) on Buddhaghosa's Commentaries to the Four Nikáyas and another on the Játakatthakathá. He is also credited with having written a tíká on the Buddhavamsa Commentary and on the Abhidhammatthakathá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Dhammapála.&lt;/b&gt;-A thera of Ceylon, generally called Culla-Dhammapála. He was the senior pupil of Vanaratana Ananda and wrote the Saccasankhepa. He is also credited with tíkás on several works, including a Línathavannaná on Ananda's Múlatiká. Gv.60, 70; also P.L.C., 203f, 211.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Dhammapála.&lt;/b&gt;-A Burmese scholar of Arimaddana. Gv.67.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

The king's generosity was unparalleled, but he gained no satisfaction there from as all the recipients of his gifts were wicked men. He therefore consulted with Vidhura and, after having discussed with him the qualities of real virtue, obtained, with Vidhura's help, five hundred Pacceka Buddhas from the Nandapabbata in Himavá and entertained them for seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Asadisadána of Pasenadi.

They lived in the time of Bhágineyya Dáthopatissa, and about fifty years after the secession of the Ságaliká from the Dhammaruci-nikáya they set up a school of their own, in which they borrowed the Ubhato-vihanga from the Dhammarucikas and the Khandaka and Parivára from the Ságalikas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;h2&gt;Durájána Játaka (No.64)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young brahmin student of Takkasilá fell in love with a woman and married her. She was very capricious and her husband neglected his duties. The teacher instructed his student to take no notice of his wife's moods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a devout layman of Sávatthi who had as wife a capricious woman. She worried him so much that he neglected his visits to the Buddha. The couple were identical in both stories. J.i.299-301.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The result was that he once suffered defeat in a rebellion. On his return from the battle he consulted his chaplain Vidhurapandita (the Bodhisatta), who told him of a goatherd of yore, called Dhúmakári. Once, when Dhumakári was tending his goats, a herd of golden deer came from the Himálaya, and he looked after them and neglected his own goats. In the autumn the deer went back to the mountains and he found that his goats had died of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Pasenadi who, like Dhanañjaya, suffered a defeat, and for the same reasons. Pasenadi sought the consolation of the Buddha, who told him this ancient tale. See Appendix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhanañjaya is identified with Ananda and Dhumakári with Pasenadi.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dárubhandaka-Mahátissa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poor man of Valliya Street in Mahágáma, so called because he earned his living by selling wood. He was very poor, and once, after consulting with his wife, offered a part of their meal to a young monk. He accepted it, but, on seeing how poor it was, threw it away. They were greatly grieved, and having obtained twelve kahápanas by placing their daughter in service, bought a cow and gave milk twice daily to the monks. Then, wishing to reclaim his daughter, the man worked for six months in a sugar mill, and, having obtained the necessary money, was on his way home, when he met Pindapátiyatissa Thera of Ambariya-vihára. As it was meal-time, the man looked for food, but could obtain it only by giving away all his money. The food so obtained he offered to the thera, who, on learning the man's story, was so greatly moved that he went to Tissamaháráma, put forth great exertion and became an arahant. Soon afterwards he died, but before his death he told his colleagues the story of his benefactor. King Kákavannatissa made arrangements for the thera's funeral, but it was found that the litter containing the body could not be moved until the king sent for the poor man, who lifted it. The body, thereupon, travelled through the air on to the funeral pyre, and Dárubhandaka-Mahátissa received great honour at the king's hands. AA.i.277ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dutthagámaní-Abhaya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (101-77 B.C.) He was the son of Kákavannatissa (ruler of Mahágáma) and of Viháradeví, and was called Gámani-Abhaya. The antenatal cravings of his mother showed that he would be a great warrior, and his father gathered at his court the most famous warriors of the land skilled in various ways. Chief among them were Nandhimitta, Súranimila, Mahásona, Gothaimbara, Theraputtábhaya, Bharana, Velusumana, Khañjadeva, Phussadeva and Labhiyavasabha. Abhaya early showed signs of an adventurous disposition, and resented the confined limits of his father's kingdom, bounded on the north by the Maháváluka-nadí, on the further bank of which lay the Sinhalese country ruled by the Damilas. Abhaya was constantly refused permission by his father to fight the Damilas and fled in anger to the hills, whence he sent his royal father a woman's garment, to indicate that he was no man. This earned for him the nickname of Duttha, which always stuck to him. At his father's death he had to fight with his brother Tissa (afterwards Saddhá-Tissa) for the possession of the throne. He was first defeated at Cúlanganiyapitthi, but later he was victorious, and the Sangha brought about a reconciliation between the brothers. When fully prepared, Dutthagámani marched against the Damila king, Elára. He rode his state elephant, Kandula, born on the same day as himself. He commenced operations at Mahlyangana, capturing fort after fort, manned by Elára's followers, and fought his way down to Maháváluka-nadí, where he pitched his camp at Kandhávárapitthi, near Vijitapura, where were concentrated the Damilas. After a siege of four months Vijitapura fell, and Dutthagámani advanced through Girilaka and Mahelanagara to Kásapabbata near Anurádhapura, the capital. (Mhv.xxv.75. It is said that in the course of his </data>
<data>journey from Mahágáma to Anurádhapura he captured thirty-two fortresses manned by the Damilas). There he waited for the onset of Elára and, in the battle that ensued, Elára was defeated and fled towards the capital, but he was pursued by Dutthagámani and slain by him in single combat close to the southern gate of the city. Elára's body was burnt with royal honours, and Dutthagámani built a tomb over the ashes and decreed that no music should be played by people passing it, a decree that was for long honoured. This act of chivalry, so much in contrast with the usual conduct of victors, earned for Dutthagámani great honour. Later, he defeated reinforcements from India under Bhalluka, nephew of Elára, and thus became sole monarch of Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the seventh day after his final victory, he celebrated a water festival at the Tissavápi and, at its conclusion, built the Maricavatthi-thúpa (q.v.) on the spot where his spear, containing the relic of the Buddha, given by the monks at Tissamaháráma, remained firmly embedded, no one being able to remove it. From now onwards, consoled by the arahants of Piyangudípa, who absolved him from blame for the slaughter of his enemies, he began his great works of piety, after having distributed largesse to his generals and soldiers. He first built the Lohapásáda (q.v.) of nine stories, resembling the palace of Bíraní, the plan of which was brought to him from Tusita by arahants. He then began his greatest achievement, the Mahá Thúpa, erected on a site visited by the Buddha during his third visit to Ceylon. The devas, led by Sakka, provided the necessary materials, discovered in various parts of the island, and he began work immediately, on the full-moon day of Vesákha. Great celebrations marked the inauguration of the mighty task, plans of various builders were inspected before the final choice and no free work was </data>
<data>allowed to be done. After the relics, obtained by the arahant Sonuttara from the Nága-world, had been enshrined in unparalleled splendour and with great feasting, but before the chatta of the cetiya and the plaster work could be finished, Dutthagámani fell ill. Saddhá-Tissa was summoned from Díghavápi, and he covered the cetiya with white cloth and crowned it with a spire of bamboo, that the king, before his death, might visualize his great work in its complete form. Theraputtábhaya, a former general, now become an arahant, and living in the Pañjalipabbata, was at the king's side at the time of his death and consoled him with reminders of the great merit he had accumulated during his life. A record of the king's good deeds was read by his secretary, from which it would appear that the king had erected ninety-nine other viháras, besides the buildings already mentioned. He had once tried to preach in the Lohapásada, but was so overcome by nervousness that, realizing how difficult was the task of the preacher, he ordered special benefactions for those who preached the Doctrine. Two gifts made by him are recorded as of very special merit - one was the sale of his special earrings to procure food for five theras during the Akkhakkháyika famine, the other was his gift of food during his flight from Cúlanganiya-pitthi (For details see Mhv.xxxii.49ff; also AA.i.365f). He was starving, and his minister Tissa procured a meal for him, but as he never ate without offering some of the food to the monks, he wished for a monk to appear before him. When a thera did so appear, he gave him all he had. He was told later, on his death bed, by Theraputtábhaya, that this food was divided among many thousands of arahants so that the merits of the donor might increase manifold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that after death Dutthagámani was born in the Tusita-world, there to await the appearance of Metteyya Buddha. </data>
<data>He will then become the chief disciple of that Buddha, and his parents will be the parents of Metteyya. Before his birth, as the son of Kákavannatissa, he was a sámanera of Kotapabbata-vihára. He fell ill through his hard work on behalf of the Sangha at the Akása-cetiya near Cittalapabbata, and as he lay dying in the Sílápassaya-parivena, Viháradeví visited him at the suggestion of an arahant thera, and after much difficulty persuaded him to be reborn in this world as her son. (These particulars relating to Dutthagámaní are summarised from Mhv. chaps.xxii.-xxxii; Dpv.xviii.53; xix.1ff; Sp.i.102).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutthagámaní is regarded as the hero of the Mahávamsa epic. His son was Sáliya, who, however, did not succeed him, preferring to marry a candála maiden, Asokamálá. Dutthagámaní's successor, therefore, was Saddhátissa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.50) mentions a minister of Dutthagámani called Lakuntaka-atimbara, whose wife was Sumaná.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutthagámaní lived to the age of sixty-eight (Mhv.xxiv.47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, after his conquest of the Damilas, he was unable to sleep for a whole month, then, at the suggestion of the monks, he took the fast of the eight vows and eight monks chanted to him the Cittayamaka. He fell asleep during the chanting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Seeing that his subjects were much given to offering sacrifices to the gods in course of which animals were killed and other sins committed, he made proclamation, soon after becoming king, that he had made a vow to offer in sacrifice all those of his subjects who were addicted to the Five Sins and walked upon the ten paths of unrighteousness. His ministers were sent to look for such people, and the proclamation had the desired effect (J.i.259f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the introductory story see the Mahákanha Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dummedha Játaka (No.122).&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta was once the state elephant of the Magadha king of Rájagaha. When the king rode in procession, the people had eyes only for the elephant, and the king, in envy, schemed to have the elephant thrown down a precipice. The mahout discovering this, flew on the elephant's back to Benares. The king of Benares welcomed them and, with their help, obtained the sovereignty of all India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's envy of people's praise of the Buddha. Devadatta is identified with the Magadha king, Sáriputta with the king of Benares and Ananda with the mahout. J.i.444f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Dwelling in solitude, she soon attained arahantship with the four patisambhidá. (See Thig.v.12 for a stanza uttered by her). She later returned to Rájagaha to worship the Buddha, and there Visákha asked her questions on the Dhamma, which she answered &quot;as easily as one might cut a lows-stalk with a knife.&quot; The questions and answers are given in the Cúla Vedalla Sutta (M.i.299ff). Visákha reported this interview to the Buddha, who praised her great wisdom and commended her eloquence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she was a servant, and one day saw the Buddha's disciple, Sujáta, begging alms and gave him a curry (ThigA. p.15 says Sujáta had just risen from samádhi).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dhajagga Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relates the story of how, when Sakka led his forces into battle, he told them that should any panic arise in their heart, they should look at the crest of his banner and their fears would immediately vanish. Or they should look at the banners of Pajápatí or Varuna or Isána. Similarly should any fear arise in the mind of a monk he should recall to mind the excellences of the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Sangha, and peace would come to him (S.i.218f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is also included among the Parittas and is called the Dhajagga Paritta (E.g., Mil.150).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that once a sámanera, helping to plaster the Díghavápi cetiya, fell from the top. His colleagues shouted to him to recall the Dhajagga Paritta. He did so, and was miraculously saved. SA.i.262f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dabba-Mallaputta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He was born at Anupiya in a family of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallaa')"&gt;Mallas&lt;/a&gt; (Kusinárá, says the Apadána). As a child of seven he saw the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; who was visiting in the Malla country, and he asked his grandmother (his mother having died at his birth) if he might join the Order under the Buddha. She brought him to the Buddha and the boy became an arahant in the Tonsure-hall. He returned with the Buddha to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; where, with the Buddha's sanction, and wishing to be of service to the Order, he took upon himself the task of appointing night's-lodgings to travelling monks and of directing them to meals. He performed his duties most diligently and with great intelligence, and his fame spread far and wide. Monks coming from afar, wishing to witness his skill, would deliberately arrive late and ask for lodgings in some place remote from Rájagaha; Dabba would &quot;burst into flame&quot; and walk ahead of them, with his finger burning to light them on the way. It was the sight of Dabba on one of these journeys which led to a slave-woman, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaa')"&gt;Punná&lt;/a&gt;, being visited by the Buddha, resulting in her becoming a Sotápanna (DhA.iii.321ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It once happened that meals were allotted by Dabba to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mettiyabhummajaka')"&gt;Mettiya-Bhummajaká&lt;/a&gt; at the house of a rich man, who, discovering their identity, gave orders that they were to be fed anyhow. The Mettiya-Bhummajaká were greatly offended, and believing that Dabba had intended to slight them, induced one of their partisans, Mettiyá, to accuse Dabba of having seduced her. The charge was investigated, Mettiyá was expelled, and </data>
<data>Dabba's fame increased (Thag.v.5; Vin.ii.74ff; iii.158f, 166f, iv.37f; Sp.iii.598f). The Mettiya-Bhummajaká persuaded the Licchavi, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaddha')"&gt;Vaddha&lt;/a&gt;, to make a similar charge against Dabba regarding his wife (Vin.ii.124f). The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tandulanaali_jat_5')"&gt;Tandulanáli Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.123f ) mentions another dispute, where&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laludayi_th')"&gt;Láludáyi&lt;/a&gt; charges Dabba with not performing his duties conscientiously. Thereupon Láludáyi was appointed to the task, but proved a failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dabba was given the rank of chief of those who appointed lodgings (senásanapaññápakánam) (A.i.24) and was given the upasampadá ordination when only seven years old. He was called Dabba because he was said to be born of his mother while she was being burnt in the funeral pyre; when the flames were extinguished, the child was found lying on one of the posts of the pyre (dabbatthambhe) (ThagA.i.41; AA.i.152f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a setthiputta in Hamsavatí in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and it was then that he conceived the desire for the rank of chief apportioner of lodgings. One hundred and three times he became king among devas and one hundred and five times king of men. In the time of Vipassí Buddha he spoke calumny about an arahant Thera, hence the conspiracy against him by the Mettiya-Bhummajaká. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he, with six others, went to the top of a hill, determined not to return till they had accomplished their purpose, but five of them died before this came to pass. The other four were Pukkusáti, Sabhiya, Báhiya, and Kumárakassapa (DhA.ii.212; ThagA.i.44ff; Ap.ii.471f; UdA.81; Sp.ii.578f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dabba evidently died young. The Udana (Ud.viii.9; UdA.431f ) contains an account of his death. One day, returning from his alms rounds in Rájagaha, he saw that he had but a short while </data>
<data>yet to live. He went, therefore, to the Buddha and, with his leave, showed various iddhi-powers and passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dípavamsa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oldest extant Páli Chronicle of Ceylon. Like the Mahávamsa, it was based on the Atthakathá handed down in the Mahávihára of Ceylon. It gives the impression not of an evenly worked out whole, but rather of a stringing together of fragments, a composition of whole lines, sometimes whole stanzas, borrowed from the Atthakathá. It is generally agreed that the Dípavamsa assumed its present form about the fourth century A.C. It is stated (Cv.xxxviii.59) that Dhátusena made endowments for the regular recital of the Dípavamsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was edited and published by Oldenberg in 1879. For details see Geiger: Dípavamsa and Mahávamsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was a setthiputta of Dhammakonda in Pabbatarattha, which belonged to the kingdom of Videha. He had thirty thousand oxen and twenty thousand cows. He had seven sons and seven daughters and numerous retainers. In the dry season he lived on an island formed by the two forks of the river Mahí, and in the rainy season in a house on the upland. One day, while he was in this house, having finished his preparations for the approach of the rains, he sat meditating on his comfortable circumstances and broke forth into song in token of his happiness. The Buddha heard the song at Sávatthi, seven hundred leagues away, and having travelled through the air, stood over Dhaniya's dwelling. As Dhaniya proceeded with his song, the Buddha added a verse to each one of Dhaniya's. At the end of this song Dhaniya, his wife, and two of his daughters, became sotápannas. The Buddha then revealed himself and Dhaniya and his wife entered the Order. Later they became arahants and the cowherds erected for their use a monastery, which came to be called the Gokulanka-vihára. SN.vv.18ff; SNA.i.26ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dhaniya.&lt;/b&gt;-A potter of Rájagaha. In his house the Buddha taught Pukkusáti the Cha-dhátu-vibhanga Sutta. Dhaniya, hearing that Pukkasáti had died an arahant the same night, was so impressed by the power of the Dhamma, that he entered the Order (Thag.v.228-30; Tha.gA.i.347f). He once made a grass but on the slopes of Isigili and lived there with several others during the rains. He continued to live there after the others had left. While he was away begging for alms, his hut was pulled down by women searching for straw and firewood, but he rebuilt it. Three times this happened, until, in </data>
<data>exasperation, Dhaniya very skilfully made bricks and tiles and built a hut both strong and splendid, with tiles of shining crimson which gave out a bell-like sound when tapped. The Buddha, seeing this, chided Dhaniya and ordered the hut to be pulled down. Dhaniya then built a hut of wood which he obtained from a guild of timber merchants, suppliers of wood to the king, giving them to understand that he had the king's permission. Vassakára, hearing of this, reported the matter to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt;, who sent for Dhaniya. Dhaniya maintained that the king, by royal proclamation, had permitted the monks to use the royal supplies of wood and other materials. Bimbisára admitted the proclamation, but said it referred only to supplies straight from the forest, and he sent Dhaniya away with a warning. The matter created a great uproar and the Buddha blamed Dhaniya. Vin.iii.41-5; Sp.ii.286.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhaniya later changed his ways and became an arahant. In the time of Sikhí Buddha he was a householder and gave the Buddha a reed-chain (? nalamálá). He is probably identical with Nalamáliya of the Apadána. Ap.ii.412.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

After Bandhula's death, Dígha was appointed in his place and accompanied the king. Once, during their travels, they came to Nangaraka (Ulumpa says DhA.iii.356) and, hearing that the Buddha was at Medatalumpa, went to see him, but Dígha stayed outside while the Buddha talked to Pasenadi (M.ii.118f; MA.ii.753f; J.iv.151). The Dhammapada Commentary (i.355ff) adds that Dígha went about reviling the king for the murder of his uncle, and that when Pasenadi went in to the Buddha, leaving the royal insignia in Dígha's charge, the latter saw his chance of revenge. He left Pasenadi, hastened to Vidúdabha and crowned him king. He then returned to Sávatthi, leaving for Pasenadi only a single horse and one female servant. It was this treachery which led to Pasenadi's untimely death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dígha-Káráyana.&lt;/b&gt;-A minister of Bhátiya (Bhátikábhaya?). He was a very learned brahmin and was appointed by the king to settle a dispute between the residents of the Mahávihára and the Abhayagiri, regarding the charge brought against Dabba-Mallaputta by the nun Mettiyá. He decided in favour of the Mahávihára residents (Sp.iii.583).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Dúsí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name of Mára in the time of Kakusandha Buddha. He was, in that birth, son of Kálí, sister of Moggallána. He first incited the brahmin householders to revile Kakusandha's monks, chief of whom were Vidhura and Sañjíva; when that effort failed owing to the thoughts of goodwill, pity, sympathy and equanimity, developed by the monks, he next incited the brahmins to show great honour to the monks, hoping, in that way, to tempt them. But, owing to the intervention of Kakusandha, Dúsí's attempts failed and he was born in the Mahá Niraya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is given in the Máratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.333ff; also Thag.1187-91; ThagA.ii.183). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dúsí is mentioned as having died early because his life was cut off by kamma (Vsm.229).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

To him were entrusted, by the king, various acts of piety, such as building the road to the shrine at Sumanakúta. In making this road the minister constructed several bridges, and, at the top of the peak, he placed an image of the god Sumana. He also built a three-storeyed pásáda at Hatthavanagalla-vihára. The village of Mahálábugaccha was given to his family in perpetuity, and he was entrusted with the special care of the Tooth Relic. (For a detailed account of his doings, see Cv.lxxxvi.4ff). He was evidently a great patron of learning (P.L.C.214, 219).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Cv.xxxviii.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhátusena.-King of Ceylon (460-78 A.C.). He was the son of Dáthánáma and brother of Silátissabodhi. He seems to have had another brother, Kumárasena (q.v.). Dhátusena belonged to the Morjyavamsa. He became a monk under his uncle, the incumbent of Díghasandasenápati-parivena, and remained with him till preparations for his campaign were made. Then he returned to the lay life, killed the Pándyan, Tiritara, then reigning at Anurádhapura, and became king. His chief work was the construction of the Kálavápi, which he carried out by damming the Gonanadí. He built eighteen viháras and eighteen tanks. He showed great favour to the monks and did many works of piety. The Ambatthala-vihára he gave to the Dhammarucikas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had two sons - Moggallána and Kassapa. Kassapa rebelled against his father at the instigation of his brother-in-law-who had been punished for ill-treating the king's daughter - and seized Dhátusena in the hope of securing his treasure. The king asked to be taken to Kálavápi, saw the Thera who had been his teacher, and announced that his whole treasure was the Kálavápi. Kassapa then had him buried alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Dhátusena's gifts is mentioned that of one thousand gold pieces spent by him for an interpretation (?) of the Dípavamsa (dípetum Dípavamsam).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Padhánakammika Tissa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five hundred monks of Sávatthi retire into the forest to meditate; one (Tissa) falls away, the rest attain arahantship. They return to the Buddha, who has a word of praise for all but Tissa. The latter renews his determination to become an arahant and walks up and down the cloister all night long, thereby earning his nickname. Becoming drowsy, he stumbles over a stone and breaks his thigh. As his colleagues are on the way to receive their alms at the house of a certain layman they hear his groans, and stopping to minister to him, are prevented from receiving their gifts. The Buddha tells them that this is not the first time that Tissa has so stood in their way and relates the Varana Játaka (q.v.), a discourse on the evils of procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DhA.iii.407ff.; in the Varana Játaka, however, the name of the monk is given as Kutumblya Tissa (q.v.); perhaps the two are identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pañcaggadáyaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin, so called because he gave the first fruits of his harvest in five stages: when it was ripe, when it was being threshed, when it was put into tubs, when it was put in the boiler, and when it was heaped on the dish. One day, the Buddha went to his house and stood at the door, while the brahmin was having his meal, his wife serving him. The wife, seeing the Buddha, and fearing that her husband would give away his food, made a sign to the Buddha to go. But the Buddha made a gesture of refusal and sent a radiance in the direction of the brahmin. The wife laughed at the Buddha's obstinacy, and, at that moment, the brahmin saw the Buddha and brought to him the remnant of his meal, which the Buddha accepted. He then preached to the brahmin and his wife, both of whom became anágámins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DhA.iv.98 ff.; the story is also found at SNA.i.270, but there the brahmin and his wife only become sotápannas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Her hands, feet, mouth, eyes and nose were hideous, hence her name (&quot;the Five Defects&quot;); but her touch was ecstatic. The reason of all this was that in a previous birth she had given clay to a Pacceka Buddha with which to tidy his dwelling, but, on first sight, she had looked angrily at him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day she happened to touch &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baka')"&gt;Baka&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares, and he became infatuated with her. He visited her home in disguise and married her. Later, wishing to make her his chief consort, but fearing the mockery of others because of her ugliness, he devised a plan by which the citizens should become aware of her divine touch.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, owing to the jealousy of the other queens, she was cast adrift in a vessel and claimed by King &lt;a href="pavarika')"&gt;Páváriya&lt;/a&gt;. Baka, hearing of this, wished to fight Páváriya, but they agreed to compromise, and from that time Pañcapápá lived for a week at a time in the house of each king.

It really belongs to the literature of the Abhidhamma type, and describes how analytical knowledge can be acquired by an arahant. It presents a systematic exposition of certain important topics of Buddhism. It is possible that, before the development of the extant Abhidhamma Pitaka, it passed as one of the Abhidhamma treatises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book consists of three Vaggas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahá Vagga, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Yuganaddha Vagga&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Paññá Vagga    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and each Vagga contains ten topics (kathá). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment of the various topics is essentially scholastic in character, and whole passages are taken verbatim from the Vinaya and from various collections of the Sutta Pitaka, while a general acquaintance with the early Buddhist legends is assumed. (Published by the P.T.S. There is an index in J.R.A.S., 1908).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A commentary exists, written by Mahánáma, a Thera of Ceylon, and called Saddhammappakásiní.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Pátikaputta had prophesied that, after death, the Licchavi general Ajita would be born in Mahá Niraya, but Ajita was born in Távatimsa and accused Pátikaputta of being a liar. Later, the Buddha visited the hermitage of Pátikaputta, with a large following, in order to refute his claims, but Pátikaputta avoided him and went to the Tindukhánuparibbájakáráma. A message was sent to him asking him to come as the Buddha was at his hermitage, but Pátikaputta was unable to arise from his seat. Thereupon, a Licchavi minister, and, after him, Jáliya Dárupattikantevási, went to fetch him, but on discovering that he could not rise, they reviled him for his boastfulness.

In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaduggata')"&gt;Maháduggata&lt;/a&gt;. In his last birth his mother was the daughter of a rich merchant of Sávatthi. During her pregnancy, she had a longing to give to five hundred monks, headed by Sáriputta, the choicest portions of red fish, to don yellow robes, to sit in the outer circle of the monks' seats, and to partake of the food left over by the monks. This longing was satisfied, and seven times she held similar festivities. When the child was born he was called Pandita because, from the day of his conception, various people of the household who had been stupid or deaf or dumb recovered their faculties. When seven years old, he was filled with the desire to become a monk, and was ordained by Sáriputta, a constant visitor to the house. For seven days his parents held a festival in honour of his ordination. On the eighth day he went, with Sáriputta, into the village for alms; on the way, certain things which he saw -  a ditch, arrow makers, carpenters - made him wish to strive for arahantship. Thereupon, with the leave of Sáriputta, he returned to the monastery requesting the Elder to bring him some red fish on his return from the alms round. In the monastery, Sakka stilled all noises and held back the sun and the moon, lest Pandita should be disturbed. The Buddha, seeing this, detained Sáriputta back on his way to the monastery, and engaged him in </data>

In the Anangana Sutta (M.i.31f), Moggallána tells Sáriputta that, one day, when begging alms in Rájagaha, he came to the house of Samíti, the wagon builder who was shaping a felloe. Standing by was Panduputta, watching him and wishing that he should shape it without blemish. When Samíti did so, Panduputta expressed his joy, saying that Samíti had read his thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.124) that Panduputta was so called because he was the son of Pandu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The pigeon had yearned too much after his mate, who was killed by a hawk; the snake had killed a bull, which trod on it; the jackal had lost his hair by clinging too long to an elephant's corpse; the bear had received many blows when he visited a village for food; while the ascetic himself had been proud until visited by a Pacceka Buddha, who pointed out to him the folly of pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anuruddha was the pigeon, Kassapa the bear, Moggallána the jackal, and Sáriputta the snake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka was related to five hundred upásakas to encourage them to keep the fast days.

She was the daughter of a banker of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, and, when grown up, formed an intimacy with a servant. When her parents wished to marry her to a youth of her own rank, she ran away with her lover and lived in a hamlet. As the time for her confinement drew near, she wished to return to her parents, but the husband, on various pretexts, put off the visit. One day when he was out she left a message with the neighbours and started for Sávatthi. Her husband followed her, but on the way she gave birth to a son, and they returned home. The same happened when her second child was born, but soon after its birth a great storm broke, and her husband went to cut some sticks and grass in the jungle with which to make a shelter. He was bitten by a snake and died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wife spent the night in misery, lying on the ground hugging her children. In the morning she discovered her husband's body, and started off to go to her parents. On the way she had to cross a river, and, because it was in flood, she could not carry both her children across at the same time. She therefore left the younger on some leaves on the bank and started wading across with the other. In midstream she looked back and saw a hawk swoop down and carry away the babe. In her excitement she dropped the child she was carrying and it was swept away by the flood. Distracted, she went on towards Sávatthi, but on the way she learnt that the house in which her parents and brother lived had fallen on them in the night and that they had been burnt on one pyre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mad with grief, she wandered about in circles, and because, as she circled round, her skirt cloth fell from her, she was called </data>
<data>Patácárá (&quot;cloak walker&quot;). People drove her from their doors, till one day she arrived in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was preaching. The people round him tried to stop her from approaching, but the Buddha called her to him and talked to her. By the potency of his gentleness, she regained presence of mind and crouched on the earth. A man threw her his outer robe, and she, wearing it, drew close to the Buddha, and worshipping at his feet, told him her story and begged for his help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spoke to her words of consolation, making her realize the inevitable ness of death; he then taught her the Truth. When he finished speaking, she became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt; and asked for ordination. Her request was granted, and one day, while washing her feet, she noticed how the water trickled, sometimes only to a short distance, sometimes further, and she pondered, &quot;even so do mortals die, either in childhood, in middle age, or in old age.&quot; The Buddha sent her a ray of glory and appeared before her, speaking and confirming her thoughts. When he had finished speaking, Patácárá won arahantship. She later became a great teacher, and many women, stricken with grief, sought her guidance and her consolation (ThigA.47,117,122). She was declared by the Buddha to be the best among Therí's who knew the Vinaya (A.i.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, she was born in a clansman's family, and having heard the Buddha speak of a nun as first among those who knew the rules of the Order, she aspired to a similar rank for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, she became a Bhikkhuní, and was third of the seven daughters of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kikii')"&gt;Kikí&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares.

Some monks once wandered all over the Lotus street to find some lotuses to offer at the Ananda bodhi (q.v.). But they found none, and Ananda, hearing of it, went himself to the Lotus street and returned with many handfuls of blue lotus. The incident was reported to the Buddha who related the story of the Játaka. J.ii.321ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pacceka Buddha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to one who is enlightened by and for himself -  i.e., one who has attained to supreme and perfect insight, but who dies without proclaiming the truth to the world -  hence the equivalent &quot;Silent Buddha&quot; sometimes found in translations. Pacceka Buddhas practise their &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/n_r/paramii')"&gt;páramí&lt;/a&gt; for at least two thousand asankheyya&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/kappa')"&gt;kappas&lt;/a&gt;. They are born in any of the three kulas: bráhmana, khattiya, or gahapati only in a vivattamána kappa, during which Buddhas are also born, but they never meet a Buddha face to face. They cannot instruct others; their realization of the Dhamma is &quot;like a dream seen by a deaf mute.&quot; They attain to all the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/g_m/iddhi')"&gt;iddhi&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/samaapatti')"&gt;samápatti&lt;/a&gt; and patisanhidá of the Buddhas, but are second to the Buddhas in their spiritual development. They do ordain others; their admonition is only in reference to good and proper conduct (abhisamácárikasikkhá). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes (e.g., at J.iv.341) it is stated that a Pacceka Buddha's knowledge and comprehension of ways and means is less than that of a Bodhisatta. They hold their uposatha in the Ratanamálaka, at the foot of the Mañjúsarukkha in Gandhamádana. It is possible to become a Pacceka Buddha while yet a layman, but, in this case, the marks of a layman immediately disappear. Three caves in the Nandamúlakapabbhára - Suvannaguhá, Maniguhá and Rajataguhá -  are the dwelling places of Pacceka Buddhas. Round the Ratanamálaka, q.v. (or Sabbaratanamálaka), seats are always ready to receive the Pacceka Buddhas. When a Pacceka Buddha appears in the world, he immediately seeks the Ratanamálaka, </data>
<data>and there takes his appointed seat. Then all the other Pacceka Buddhas in the world assemble there to meet him, and, in reply to a question by the chief of them, he relates the circumstances which led to his enlightenment. Similarly, all the Pacceka Buddhas assemble at the same spot when one of them is about to die. The dying one takes leave of the others, and, after his death, they cremate his body and his relics disappear. These details are given in SNA.i.47, 51, 58, 63; KhA.178, 199; ApA.i.125; see also s.v. Gandhamádana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, according to another account, they die on the mountain called Mahápapáta (q.v.). There does not seem to be any limit to the number of Pacceka Buddhas who could appear simultaneously. In one instance, five hundred are mentioned as so doing, all sons of Padumavatí (q.v.), at the head of whom was Mahápaduma. In the Isigili Sutta (M.iii.68ff ) appears a long list of Pacceka Buddhas who dwelt on the Isigili Mountain (q.v.), and after whom the mountain was named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.889ff), the names in this list belonged to the five hundred sons of Padumavatí, but the number of the names is far less than five hundred. This discrepancy is explained by saying that as many as twelve bore the same name. Other names are found scattered over different texts, such as the Játakatthakathá. E.g., Darímukha (J.iii.240), Sonaka (v.249); see also DhA. iv.120, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name occurring most frequently in the texts is that of Tagarasikhí (q.v.). Mention is also made of the Pacceka Buddhas going among men for alms and spending the rainy season in dwellings provided by men. E.g., DhA.ii.112f.; iii.91, 368; iv.200. Their patthaná (SNA.51). Their wisdom less than that of a Bodhisatta (J.iv.341).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the teachings preserved of the Pacceka Buddhas, the most important is the Khaggavisána Sutta (q.v.). For the definition of a Pacceka </data>
<data>Buddha see Puggalapiññatti (p.14; cf. p.70). There he is described as one who understands the Truth by his own efforts, but does not obtain omniscience nor mastery over the Fruits (phalesu vasíbhávam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;See also Mátanga (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Pabbatúpama Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi comes to the Buddha and tells him that he has been much occupied with kingly matters. The Buddha reminds him by means of a parable that old age and death are ceaselessly rolling on upon him, like mighty mountains crushing everything in their way. Against such an advance his counsellors and his armies would be useless, and the king admits that leading the righteous life is the only way (S.i.100f). The Commentary adds (SA.i.131f ) that on the occasion of this visit the king had been attacked by bandits lying in wait for him in the Andhavana. He had, however, been warned, and, having surrounded the wood destroyed the bandits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pabbatúpama Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dukkha which one Ariyan disciple who has won understanding has destroyed, placed beside the dukkha which remains to be destroyed, would be like the whole Himálaya beside seven grains of gravel the size of mustard seeds.

It consists of sixteen suttas preceded by an introduction of fifty six Vatthugáthá. The Vatthugáthá describe how &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari')"&gt;Bávarí&lt;/a&gt; first heard of the coming of the Buddha from a devotee and sent sixteen of his pupils to visit the Buddha and find out if his claims to Enlightenment were true.

The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niddesa')"&gt;Culla Nidesa&lt;/a&gt; comments on the sixteen suttas, but makes no mention of the Vatthugáthá. Perhaps, at one time, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khaggavisaana')"&gt;Khaggavisána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; was attached to the Páráyana Vagga.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Páráyana Vagga is mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anguttara_nikaya')"&gt;Anguttara Nikáya&lt;/a&gt; (A.i.133, 134; ii.45; iv.63) and in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samyutta_nikaya')"&gt;Samyutta Nikáya&lt;/a&gt; (S.ii.49), which is evidence of its having been one of the oldest collections.

It is said (E.g., AA.i.57) that at the end of the discourses contained in the Páráyana Vagga, fourteen crores of beings realized nibbána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.717) that the Páráyana was so called because it leads to nibbána (nibbánasahkhátam páram ayanato Páráyaná ti laddhavoháram dhammam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Páráyana Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha teaches the goal (páráyana) and the path leading thereto.

The Buddha visits the hermitage of the paribbájaka Bhaggava at Anupiya and the conversation turns on the Licchavi Sunakkhatta's reason for leaving the Order. Sunakkhatta was dissatisfied because the Buddha would not work mystic wonders for him nor reveal to him the beginnings of things. Mention is also made of Korakkhattiya, Kandaramasuka and Pátikaputta, whom Sunakkhatta held in great esteem for their austerities, but whose spiritual development was insignificant. The Buddha is shown as holding the practice of miracles not entirely worthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the sutta, which is a kind of appendix, deals with the beginnings of things.

The Buddha visited it shortly before his death. It was then a mere village and was known as Pátaligáma. At that time &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu's&lt;/a&gt; ministers, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sunidha')"&gt;Sunídha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vassakaara')"&gt;Vassakára&lt;/a&gt;, were engaged in building fortifications there in order to repel the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii')"&gt;Vajjís&lt;/a&gt;. The Buddha prophesied the future greatness of Pátaligáma, and also mentioned the danger of its destruction by fire, water, or internal discord. The gate by which the Buddha left the town was called Gotamadvára, and the ferry at which he crossed the river, Gotamatittha (Vin.i.226 30; D.ii.86ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The date at which Pátaliputtta became the capital is uncertain. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt; seems to record (Beal: Records ii.85, n. 11) that it was Kálásoka who moved the seat of government there. The Jains maintain that it was Udáyi, son of Ajátasattu (Vin. Texts ii.102, n. 1). The latter tradition is probably correct as, according to the Anguttara Nikáya (iii.57) even Munda is mentioned as residing at Pátaliputta. It was, however, in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka')"&gt;Asoka&lt;/a&gt; that the city enjoyed its greatest glory. In the ninth year of his reign Asoka's income from the four gates of the city is said to have been four hundred thousand kahápanas daily, with another one hundred thousand for his sabhá or Council (Sp.i.52).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city was known to the Greeks as Pálibothra, and Megasthenes, who spent some time there, has left a vivid description of it (Buddhist India 262f). It continued to be the capital during the greater part of </data>
<data>the Gupta dynasty, from the fourth to the sixth century A.C. Near Pátaliputta was the Kukkutáráma, where monks (e.g. Ananda, Bhadda and Nárada) stayed when they came to Pátaliputta (M.i.349; A.v.341; A.iii.57; S.v.15f., 171f). At the suggestion of Udena Thera, the brahmin Ghotamukha built an assembly ball for the monks in the city (M.ii.163).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pátaligáma was so called because on the day of its foundation several pátali shoots sprouted forth from the ground. The officers of Ajátasattu and of the Licchavi princes would come from time to time to Pátaligáma, drive the people from their houses, and occupy them themselves. A large hall was therefore built in the middle of the village, divided into various apartments for the housing of the officers and their retainers when necessary. The Buddha arrived in the village on the day of the completion of the building, and the villagers invited him to occupy it for a night, that it might be blessed by his presence. On the next day they entertained the Buddha and his monks to a meal (Ud.viii.6; UdA.407ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pátaliputta was also called Pupphapura (Mhv.iv.31, etc.; Dpv.xi.28) and Kusamapura (Mbv.p.153). The journey from Jambukola, in Ceylon, to Pátaliputta took fourteen days, seven of which were spent on the sea voyage to Támalitti (E.g., Mhv.xi.24). The Asokáráma built by Asoka was near Pátaliputta (Mhv.xxix.36). The Buddha's water pot and belt were deposited in Pátaliputta after his death (Bu.xxviii.9). The Peta Vatthu Commentary (p.271) mentions that trade was carried on between Pátaliputta and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannabhuumi')"&gt;Suvannabhúmi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Pamkkamasamudda.&lt;/b&gt; A tank built by Parakkamabáhu I. and attached to the river system of the Káragangá. It was, probably, in the neighbourhood of Pulatthipura and had many canals branching off: the Gambhíra, Hemavatí, Nílaváhiní, Salalavatí, Vettavatí, Mangalagangáand Campá; and contained many sluices: Makara, Málatípuppha, Vettavatí, Dakkhiná, Mangala and Candí. The canal connecting it with the Káragangá was called the Ákásagangá. Cv.lxxix.26f., 40ff.; see also Cv.Trs.ii.117, n.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samannaphala_s')"&gt;Sámaññaphala Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.i.56),&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátassattu&lt;/a&gt; is said to have visited him and obtained from him an exposition of his teaching, which was to the effect that the four elements -  earth, fire, air, water; pleasure, pain, and the soul -  these seven things were eternally existent and unchangeable in their very nature; that there is no volitional activity of consciousness in them. His doctrine is, therefore, one of non action (akiriya váda). When one, with a sharp sword, cleaves a head in twain, no one is thereby deprived of life, a sword has merely penetrated into the interval between seven elementary substances (cf. the doctrine of the Cartesians, that there is no sin in taking the life of lower animals because they have no soul). In other words, there is no such act as killing, or hearing, or knowing, etc.; no conceptions of, or distinction between, good and bad, knowledge and ignorance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakudha's teachings are also referred to in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sandaka_sutta')"&gt;Sandaka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.517), and there described at even greater length, but here his name is not mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; adds (DA.i.144) that Pakudha avoided the use of cold water, using always hot; when this was not available, he did not wash. If he crossed a stream he would consider this as a sin, and would make expiation by constructing a mound of earth. This is evidence of the ascetic tendency in his teaching on matters of external conduct. His teaching is, however, described </data>
<data>as nissirikaladdhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are told (M.i.250; ii.4) that Pakudha's followers did not hold him in high esteem, in contrast to the devotion felt for the Buddha by his followers. Pakudha did not welcome questions, and displayed annoyance and resentment when cross examined. Elsewhere (E.g., M.i.198; S.i.66; SN.p.91) however, he is spoken of as having been highly honoured by the people, a teacher of large and well reputed schools, with numerous followers. But he did not lay claim to perfect enlightenment (S.i.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakudha Kaccáyana's name is spelt in several ways. Some texts give his personal name as Kakudha, or Kakuda. In the Prasnopanisad (Barus: Prebuddhistic Indian Philosophy, 281; see also Dvy.143; Mtu.i.253, 256, 259; iii.383) mention is made of a Kakuda Kátyána, a younger contemporary of Pippaláda. There he is called Kabandhin, which name, like Kakuda, means that he had a hump on his neck or shoulder.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.144; SA.i.102) that Pakudha was his personal name and Kaccáyana that of his gotta. The Kaccáyana (or Kátiyána, as it is sometimes called) was a brahmin gotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakudha is mentioned as having been, in a past life, one of the five ditthigatikas mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahabodhi_jat_528')"&gt;Mahábodhi Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.246). He is also mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/milindapanha')"&gt;Milindapañha&lt;/a&gt; as one of the teachers visited by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/milinda')"&gt;Milinda&lt;/a&gt;. The whole account is either a plagiarism of the Sámaññaphala Sutta or else the teachers referred to only belonged to the same respective schools of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was subject to the will of Sakka, and the books contain instances of his causing rain to fall at the command of Sakka (J.i.330; Mhv.xxi.31; J.iv.253). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was also influenced by the exercise of saccakiriyá (protestation of truth) E.g., J.i.331f. Buddhaghosa (SA.i.64) describes him as Vassavaláhaka, and says that he was an inhabitant of the Cátummahárájika-world. Kokanadá and Culla Kokanadá were his daughters (S.i.29f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pajjunna is mentioned among the Maháyakkhas to be invoked in time of need (D.iii.205), and he was present at the preaching of the Mahásamaya Sutta. Ibid., ii.260.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Its site was one of the resting places of the Bodhi tree on the way from Jambukola to Anurádhapura.

Even thus widespread is the ruin of things, yet from such widespread ruin will be saved those who have the gift of realizing the Four Noble Truths. S.v.441.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the Buddha found that he could not persuade the Kosambí monks to refrain from quarrelling, he left Kosambí alone and unattended, and passing through&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/balakalonakarama')"&gt;Bálaklonakáragáma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="pacinavamsamigadaya')"&gt;Pácínavamsadáya&lt;/a&gt;, went to Párileyyaka, where he stayed at the foot of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddasaala')"&gt;Bhaddasála&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rakkhita_vanasanda')"&gt;Rakkhitavanasanda&lt;/a&gt;. There a certain elephant who, finding communal life distasteful, had left his herd, waited on the Buddha, ministering to all his needs. From Párileyyaka the Buddha went on to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.352f.; S.iii.95; Ud.iv.5; J.iii.489; M.i.320). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was in the tenth year after the Enlightenment (BuA., p.3). The Commentaries (E.g., DhA.i.48ff.; iv.26 ff. UdA.250f.; see Thomas, op. cit., 117 n ) say that the elephant's name was Párileyya, and describe in vivid detail the perfect manner in which he looked after the Buddha, omitting nothing, even to the extent of finding hot water for his bath. There was also there a monkey who offered the Buddha a honeycomb. Soon after, the monkey fell on a tree stump and died and was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when Ananda came with five hundred others to invite the Buddha to return to Sávatthi, Párileyyaka provided them all with food. He died of a broken heart when the Buddha left the forest, and was born in Távatimsa in a golden palace, thirty leagues high, where he came to be known as Párileyyaka devaputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This elephant is identified with the elephant of the </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pásánaka cetiya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrine near Rájagaha, where the disciples of Bivarí met and questioned the Buddha (SN.vs.1013). The Buddha went there from Sávatthi, knowing it to be the best place in which to meet them. Bávarí's disciples followed him thither. The cetiya was originally a shrine dedicated to some divinity (devatthána) and built on a great rock, hence its name. Later, it was converted into a vihára for the Buddha, being within easy reach of the town. Sakka built there a great hall (mandapa) for the Buddha (SNA. 583, 584). This hall was evidently behind the cetiya (pitthipásáne). AA.i.184.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the time of Atthadassí Buddha he was a Yakkha, and, learning that the Buddha had died before he could pay him homage, he was filled with grief. The Buddha's disciple, Ságara, advised him to honour the Buddha's Thúpa, and this he did for five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven kappas ago he became king four times under the name of Bhúiripañña (Ap.i.153). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Ekúdániya Thera.

Palása Játaka (No. 307)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a poor brahmin paid great honour to a judas tree (palása), hoping thereby to get some benefit. One day, the tree sprite appeared before him in disguise and asked why he honoured the tree. Pleased with his answer, the sprite revealed his identity and helped the brahmin to obtain the treasure which lay buried beneath the tree. The story was related to Ananda as he stood weeping, leaning against the lintel, when the Buddha lay dying. The Buddha sent for him and told him not to grieve as his services to the Buddha would not be fruitless. Ananda is identified with the poor brahmin. J.iii.23ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Palása Játaka (No. 370)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was a golden goose living in Cittakúta. On his way to and fro from the Himálaya, he rested on a palása tree and a friendship sprang up between him and the treesprite. One day a bird dropped a banyan seed in the fork of the palásatree from which a sapling sprang. The goose advised the sprite to destroy it, but he paid no heed, and by and by the banyan grew up and destroyed the palása.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related by the Buddha to the monks in order to illustrate that sins should be uprooted however small they may be.

He held the view that there was no world other than this, no fruit of actions and no rebirth. But after a discussion with&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaara_kassapa')"&gt;Kúmara Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, who was staying in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/simsapavana')"&gt;Simsapávana&lt;/a&gt; near by, he was convinced of the error of his views. Thereupon he instituted an almsgiving to all who sought his generosity. The gifts were, however, coarse and unpalatable. A young brahmin named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttara')"&gt;Uttara&lt;/a&gt;, who came to the almsgiving and was passed over, spoke scornfully of the gifts. Hearing of this, Páyási appointed him to supervise the distribution. After death, Páyási was born among the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Cátummahárájika&lt;/a&gt; god's while Uttara was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gavampati')"&gt;Gavampati&lt;/a&gt; met Páyási in the deva world, and Páyási instructed him to teach men to give their gifts with thoroughness and with their own hands (D.ii.316ff.; VvA.297f., 331f). Páyási devaputta was also known as Serísakadevaputta because he lived in the Serísaka vimána.

Their early origin is not known, Mánavamma is said to have built for them a pásáda in the Thúpáráma (Cv.xlvii.66). They also occupied the Rájamátika vihára and enjoyed the special favour of both Aggabodhi V. and of Aggabodhi VII (Ibid., xlviii.4, 16, 73). Vajira, senápati of Aggabodhi IX., built for them the Kacchavála vihára (Ibid., xlix.80). Sena I. established for them headquarters on the Arittha pabbata and also made special provision for them at Pulatthipura (Ibid., l.63, 76). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They seem to have originally belonged to the congregation of the Abhayagiri vihára, and continued to do so up to the reign of Sena II., when they separated off and formed special groups (Ibid., li.52). Later, Sena Ilanga, general of Kassapa IV., built the Samuddagiri parivena, in the Mahá vihára for their use, and it is said that he dispensed rice and clothing to the mothers of the Pamsukulikas (Ibid., Iii.21). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Udaya III. various officials of the court fled to the tapovana occupied by the Pamsukulikas, but were pursued thither by the king and his viceroy and beheaded. Incensed by this act, the Pamsukulikas left the tapovana, which stood on land granted by the king, and went to Rohana. The people rose in rebellion, and those who had perpetrated the crime in the tapovana visited the Pamsukulikas in Rohana, asked their forgiveness, and persuaded them to return (Ibid., Iiii.14ff., 21ff). Mahinda IV. also showed them great honour (Ibid., liv.18, 24f). We hear of them last in the reign of Vikkamabáhu II., when that king deprived them of their lands, and they, in anger, retired again to Rohana (Ibid., lxi.59f). Thenceforth we hear no more of </data>
<data>the sect, and it probably ceased to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is mentioned in the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.52f ) that, after the depredations of Candála Tissa, when the religion was at a very low ebb, a discussion arose between the Pamsukulikas and the Dhammakathíkas as to which was the more important branch of the sásana pariyatti or patipatti. The Pamsukulikas voted for patipatti, but were defeated by the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was on this occasion that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda_s')"&gt;Cunda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (1) was preached (SNA.i. 159).

The Játaka derives its name from the first of these, who was a villager of Kási. He went with his friend into the fields, each carrying a flask of water. From time to time they drank, but the first drank out of the other's flask, wishing to save the water in his own. In the evening remorse seized him, and as he stood reflecting on his wickedness he became a Pacceka Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pacceka Buddhas met at Nandamúlapabbhára and together visited the king of Benares who was the Bodhisatta. On hearing their stories he renounced the world, and, in spite of the efforts of his consort to stop him, became an ascetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to five hundred householders of Sávatthi who became monks. They lived in the monastery but indulged in thoughts of sin. The Buddha sent Ananda to summon them, and admonished them saying that no matter how small a sin it was, it must be checked (J.iv.113ff). The queen consort of the story was Ráhulamátá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His chief disciple was away at the time of his (the Bodhisatta's) death, and when his other disciples asked him, just before his death, what excellence he had won, he answered &quot;Nothing,&quot; meaning, &quot;insight into the nothingness of things.&quot; But they did not understand, and therefore neglected to pay him the customary honours at his cremation. When the chief disciple returned and heard of this, he tried to explain matters to them, but they would not hearken until the Bodhisatta himself appeared from the Brahmaworld and convinced them of their folly. &quot;Far better than a thousand fools,&quot; he said, &quot;is one who, hearing, understands.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Sáriputta's great wisdom. He is identified with the chief disciple (J.i.406ff). See also Sarabhanga Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the latter the fortunate ones are born, and it is a great disadvantage to be born outside it; for, then, the possibilities of hearing of the Buddha and his teaching become remote (E.g., DhA.iii.248, 489; KhA.133). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boundaries of the Majjhimadesa are given in several places, and the Paccantajanapada, lies beyond these boundaries. They are: in the east, Kajangala and Mahásálá; in the south east, the river Salalavatí; in the south, Setakanniká; in the west, Thúna; and in the north, Usíraddhaja (pabbata) (Vin.i.197; J.i.49; cp.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pañcasikha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Gandhabba. His favourite instrument was the Beluvapanduvíná (q.v.). He was considered a favourite of the Buddha (DA.iii.699), and when Sakka visited the Buddha at the Indasálaguhá in order to ask him certain questions, he sent Pañcasikha in advance, that he might obtain permission for the interview. The episode in given in full in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.263ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pañcasikha approached the Buddha and playing on his viná, sang of the beauties of the Buddha, the Doctrine, Arahants and Love. The verses really formed a love poem addressed to his beloved, Bhaddá Suriyavaccasá, daughter of the Gandhabba Timbarú. The Buddha praised his music and song and questioned him about the poem. He confessed that when the Buddha was staying under the Ajapála nirgodba, before the Enlightenment, he (Pañcasikha) had met Suriyavaccasá going with her father to dance before Sakka. Pañcasikha thereupon fell in love with her; but she favoured the suit of Sikhandi, son of Mátali. Pañcasikha thereupon composed a song, which he sang to her. She was greatly pleased with the references in the song to the Sákyan sage of whom she had heard when she went to the Sudhammásabhá, (on this occasion Sakka, pronounced his 8 fold eulogy of the Buddha, contained in the Mahágovinda Sutta, says Buddhaghosa, DA.ii.704) and she consented to marry Pañcasikha. It is said that Sakka blessed the marriage in return for Pañcasikha's intercession with the Buddha on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.211; also in the Mahágovinda Sutta, D.ii.230) it is stated that when Brahmá Sanankumára appeared before the assembly of the gods of Távatimsa and materialized himself he assumed the form of Pañcasikha. Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.640), by way of explanation, </data>
<data>that all the devas loved Pañcasikha and wished to resemble him. In the Mahágovinda Sutta (D.i.220; cp. Mtu.iii.197ff) Pañcasikha is represented as conveying to the Buddha a full report of the happenings in the assembly of the devas, when Sakka spoke the Buddha's praises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No really satisfactory explanation is found in the Commentaries of Pañcasikha's name. Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.647) Pañcasikho ti pañcacúlo, pañcakundaliko, and goes on to say that Pañcasikha was born once as a human being, and, while yet a boy wearing his hair in five knots* (pañcacúlakadáraka kále), he became chief of those who tended the calves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* This is done even now in Ceylon, where young boys' hair is tied round their heads in several knots. But in one place (DA.i.296) Buddhaghosa says that one way of insulting a man was to shave his head, leaving him five locks of hair (garaháyá ti pañcasikhá mundakaranam). And, again (SA.i.171), he mentions that Sanankumára retained his eternal youth because in a previous life he had developed jhána while yet a lad (pañcasikhakumárakále). See also J.vi.496, where a traitor had his hair tied in five knots as a sign of disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with other lads he engaged in works of public utility, such as repairing roads, digging wells, building rest houses, etc., and he died while young. He was reborn in the Cátummahárájika world, destined to live for ninety thousand years, his body three gávutas in height. He wore on his person one hundred cartloads of ornaments and rubbed nine pots of perfume on his body. He wore red robes, and on his head a chaplet of red gold, round which his hair was arranged in five locks (kuntalikehi), which fell back as in the case of a young boy (pañcacúli-kadárakapariháren'eva).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Pañcasikha who first received from the king of the Cátummahárájika worlds and their ministers reports of good deeds done by human </data>
<data>beings. These he would pass on to Mátali, who, in his turn, presented them to Sakka (DA.ii.650). On the day of the Devorohana, when the Buddha descended from Távatimsa, Pañcasikha was present to render honour to the Teacher in song and music (DhA.iii.225; AA.i.72; Vsm.392). According to the legends (E.g., Mhv.xxx.75; xxxi.82) he was present with the Buddha on other occasions as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pañcasikha was evidently not only the name of a person, but also of an office (like Sakka), for in the Bilárakosiya Játaka (q.v.) Ananda is said to have been born as Pañcasikha and to have helped Sakka and others to make of Bílárakosiya a generous man (J.iv.69). Similarly, in the Sudhábhojana Játaka (q.v.), Anuruddha is identified with Pañcasikha. J.v.412.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He belonged to a family of Máhásála brahmins in Vesáli and became an arahant at the age of five. It is said that he heard his parents take the five precepts, and remembered his own actions of a past life when, in the time of Anomadassí Buddha, he was a ferryman on the Candavatí and took the five precepts from the Buddha's disciple Nisabha, keeping them for one hundred thousand years.

Seeing a cave, he dwelt there, a woman from the neighbouring village supplying him with food. The deity in the cave found the Elder's presence inconvenient, but could think of no excuse for asking him to go away, his life having been spotless. But after much thinking, she hit upon a plan; she took possession of the body of the youngest son of the woman who supplied the Elder, and wrung his neck, telling the mother that he would be cured if she could get certain things from the Elder as medicine. This the woman refused to do, but, in the end, she consented to throw on the head of her son, with the Elder's permission, the water used for washing the latter's feet. When the Elder returned to his cave the deity addressed him as &quot;physician.&quot; He could not understand this until she had told him the story. Then realizing how blameless his life had been, he was filled with joy and attained arahantship. But because the deity had tried to bring calumny on him, he asked her to leave the forest.

In this connection the Páveyyaká are also described as &quot;Pacchimiká&quot; in opposition to the Vajjiputtakas who are called &quot;Pácínaká.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is explained (E.g., MT.166) that the Páveyyaká were called &quot;Pacchimiká&quot; because they lived to the west.

In four cases out of the two hundred and twenty seven the punishment for infringement of a rule is exclusion from the Order; in all the remaining cases, it is merely suspension for a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules are arranged in seven sections &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Párajiká Dhammá&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s4_sap')"&gt;Sanghádisesá&lt;/a&gt;-pátimokkha&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Aniyatá&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Nissaggiyápácittiyá&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pácittiyá-pátimokkha&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Patidesaníyá&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sekkiyá pátimokkha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;corresponding very roughly to the degree of weight attached to their observance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pátimokkha is not included in the extant Buddhist Canon. The rules are included, in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vibhanga')"&gt;Sutta Vibhanga&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;sutta&quot; here meaning &quot;rule&quot;), which contains besides the rules themselves, an old Commentary explaining them and a new Commentary containing further supplementary information concerning them. The rules are divided into two parts: one for the monks (Bhikkhu Pátimokkha) and the other for the nuns (Bhikkhukní Pátimokkha). It is a moot point whether the rules originally appeared with the explanatory notes (as in the Vibhanga), the Pátimokkha being subsequently extracted, or whether the Pátimokkha alone was the older portion, the additional matter of the Vibhanga being the work of a subsequent revision. For a discussion of this, see Vin.i. Introd.xvi; Law: Páli. </data>
<data>Lit. 2ff.; Hastings: Encyclopaedia under Pátimokkha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes suggested (Law: op. cit., p.2) that the original number of Pátimokkha rules numbered only about one hundred and fifty. A passage in the Anguttara Nikáya (i.231-232) is quoted in support of this suggestion (sádhikam diyaddhasikkhápadasatam). According to this theory the seventy five Sekhiyá rules were added later. See Law: op. cit., 19f.; Law's argument, however, that the Pátimokkha rules were among the texts not recited at the First Council, is due to a wrong understanding of the Sumangala Vilásiní passage (i.17). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules were recited at the gatherings of members of the Order (the Uposatha khandha of the Mahá Vagga (Vin.i.101 36) gives details of the procedure at these gatherings) in their respective districts on uposatha days (the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month). Each section of the rules is recited and, at the end of such recital, the reciter asks the members of the Order who are present if any one of them has infringed any of the rules. Silence implies absence of guilt. This practice of interrupting the recital seems to have been changed later (see Vin.ii.240 ff.) even though the old formula, asking the members to speak, continued as a part of the recital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word pátimokkha is variously explained, the oldest explanation being that the observance of the rules is the face (mukham), the chief (pamukham) of good qualities. The Sanskritised form of the word being prátimoksa, this led to a change in its significance, the completion of the recital being evidence that all those who have taken part are pure in respect of the specified offences -  pátimokkha thus meaning acquittal, deliverance or discharge. But in most contexts the word simply means code -  i.e., code of verses for the members of the Order.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pandú&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nation in South India, the Pandiyas. Their country comprised the greater part of the Madura and Tinnevelly, with its capital first at Kolkai and later at Madhurá. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceylon was inconstant communication with this country, both peaceful and otherwise. Marauding bands of Pandús often came to Ceylon and, having deposed the rightful sovereign, ruled over the country. Chief among these invasions were the following: (a) for fourteen years, when Vattagámani lay in hiding; (b) for twenty seven years, after the death of Mahánáma and until Dhátusena established his authority; (c) in the time of Sena I.; (d) after the death of Mahinda V. They also came with Mágha and Candabhánu, and, later, with Áryacakkavattin, who succeeded in carrying the Tooth Relic away to the Pándyan court; this was later rescued by Parakkamabáhu III. Sometimes the Singhalese kings would make reprisals by invading the Pándyan territory   e.g., in the reign of Sena II., and, perhaps also, under Nissanka Malla. Parakkamabáhu I. sent an army under his general Lankápura to help the Pándyan king Parákrama Pándya against the Cola king, Kulasekhara. This, according to the Mahávamsa account, brought great joy to the Singhalese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made in the chronicles of several marriages between members of the Pándyan and the Singhalese royal families. Vijaya himself took his consort from the Pándyan king at Madhurá, and later, Mittá, sister of Vijayabáhu I., married a Pándyan prince who became the grandfather of Parakkamabáhu 1. This led to the establishment of a &quot;Pándyan party&quot; in Ceylon which was not always loyal to the reigning monarch   e.g., in the case of Vikkamabáhu III. Parakkama Pandu, who deposed Lílávati, evidently belonged to this party and probably also Vijaya III. The Pándyan kings claimed descent from </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Kosala and contemporary of the Buddha. He was the son of Mahá Kosala, and was educated at Takkasilá where, among his companions, were the Licchavi Maháli and the Malla prince Bandhula. On his return home his father was so pleased with his proficiency in the various arts that he forthwith made him king. (DhA.i.338; for his genealogy see Beal: Records ii.2, n. 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ruler, Pasenadi gave himself wholeheartedly to his administrative duties (*2) and valued the companionship of wise and good men (*3). Quite early in the Buddha's ministry, (*4) Pasenadi became his follower and close friend, and his devotion to the Buddha lasted till his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*2) E.g., S.i.74, 100; the Commentary (SA i.109f.) adds that the king tried to put down bribery and corruption in his court, but his attempt does not appear to have been very successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*3) Thus he showed his favour to Pokkharasádi and Cankí, by giving them, respectively, the villages of Ukkatthá and Opasáda free of all taxes. It is said that his alms halls were always open to everyone desiring food or drink (Ud.ii.6). Even after becoming the Buddha's follower, he did not omit to salute holy men of other persuasions (Ud.vi.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*4) According to Tibetan sources, Pasenadi's conversion was in the second year of the Buddha's ministry (Rockhill, p.49). We find the king referring to the Buddha, at their first meeting, as being young in years (S.i.69). Their first meeting and conversation, which ended in Pasenadi's declaring himself an adherent of the Buddha, are recorded in the Dahara Sutta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pasenadi's conversion did not prevent him from extending his favour, with true Indian toleration, to the members of other </data>
<data>religious orders. Mention is even made of a great animal sacrifice which he once prepared, but which he abandoned on the advice of the Buddha, whom he sought at Mallika's suggestion (*5). He frequently visited the Buddha and discussed various matters with him (*6). The whole of the Third Samyutta (Kosala Saipyutta), consisting of twenty five anecdotes, each with a moral bias, is devoted to him. The topics discussed are many and varied. The Buddha and Pasenadi were equals in age, and their talks were, therefore, intimate and frank (*7). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*5) S.i.75; for details see the Mahásupina and Lohakumbhi Játakas. It is said (SA.i.111) that the king fell in love with a woman while riding round the city; on discovering that she was married, he ordered her husband to go, before sunset, and fetch clay and lilies from a pond one hundred leagues away. When the man had gone, the king ordered the gatekeepers to shut the gates early and not on any account to open them. The husband returned in the evening, and finding the gates shut, went to Jetavana, to seek protection from the king's wrath. The king spent a sleepless night owing to his passion and had bad dreams. When the brahmins were consulted they advised a great animal sacrifice. The story is also found at DhA.ii.1ff., with several variations in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*6) It is said that he went three times a day to wait on the Buddha, sometimes with only a small bodyguard. Some robbers, knowing this, arranged an ambush in the Andhavana. But the king discovered the plot, of which he made short work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*7) Pasenadi was extremely attached to the Buddha, and the books describe how, when he saw the Buddha, he bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, covering them with kisses and stroking them (M.ii.120). The Chinese records say (Beal,xliv) that when the Buddha went to Távatimsa, Pasenadi </data>
<data>made an image of the Buddha in sandalwood, to which he paid honour. He was very jealous of the Buddha's reputation, and put down with a firm hand any attempt on the part of heretics to bring discredit on him - e.g., in the case of Sundarí Nandá (q.v.). In the Aggañña Sutta (D.iii.83f.), the Buddha explains why Pasenadi honours him. For Pasenadi's own explanation as to why people honoured the Buddha even more than the king, see M.ii.123; see also A.v.65 ff. Pasenadi was also jealous of the reputation of the Order, and if anything arose which seemed likely to bring discredit on it, he took prompt steps to have the matter remedied -  e.g., in the case of Kundadhána (q.v.) and Kumára Kassapa's mother (q.v.). Pasenadi's palace overlooked the Aciravati, and when he once saw some monks sporting in the river in an unseemingly way, he made sure that the Buddha knew of it (Vin.iv.112). The story of the blind man and the elephant shows that he was anxious to justify the Buddha's teaching as against that of other sects (SNA.ii.529).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one occasion we find the Buddha telling him to eat less and teaching his nephew Sudassana (or Uttara) a verse on the advantages of moderation, to be repeated to the king whenever he sat down to a meal. This advice was followed and the king became slim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;S.i.81; DhA.iii.264f.; iv.6f.; the Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.136) states that the bowl out of which he ate (paribhogapáti) was the size of a cartwheel. Pasenadi was always conscious of his own dignity - e.g., the incident with Chattapáni (q.v.); but see Vin.iv.157f., which probably refers to the same story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi's chief consort was Malliká, daughter of a garland maker (see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa')"&gt;Malliká&lt;/a&gt; for details of her marriage with the king). He loved </data>
<data>her dearly and trusted her judgment in all things. When in difficulty he consulted her, realizing that her wisdom was greater than his own (E.g., in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana')"&gt;Asadisadána&lt;/a&gt;). There is an account given (S.i.74) of Pasenadi seeking a confession from her that she loved him more than her own soul (attá) as a confirmation of their mutual trust. But the queen was pious and saw into the reality of things, and declared that nothing was dearer to her than her own soul. Piqued by this answer, Pasenadi sought the Buddha, who comforted him by explaining the true import of Malliká's words. On another occasion, Pasenadi expressed to the Buddha his disappointment that Malliká should have borne him a daughter instead of a son; but the Buddha pointed out to him that there was much, after all, to be said for daughters (S.i.83).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malliká predeceased Pasenadi (A.iii.57); he had also other wives, one of them being the sister of Bimbisára, (*14) and another Ubbirí (q.v.). The Kannakatthala Sutta (M.ii.125) mentions two others who were sisters: Somá and Sakulá. (*16)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*14) DhA.i.385; Pasenadi's relations with Bimbisára were very cordial. Bimbisára had five millionaires in his kingdom   Jotiya, Jatila, Mendaka, Punnaka and Kákavaliya   while Pasenadi had none. Pasenadi therefore visited Bimbisára and asked for one to be transferred to him. Bimbisára gave him Dhanañjaya, Mendaka's son, and Pasenadi settled him in Sáketa (DhA.i.385ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*16) In the Samyutta Nikáya (v. 351), the king's chamberlains, Isidatta and Purána, speak of his harem. When he went riding in the park he took with him his favourite and lovely wives on elephants, one before and one behind. They were sweetly scented   &quot;like caskets of scent&quot;   and their hands were soft to the touch.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is stated that Pasenadi wished to associate himself with the Buddha's family so that their relationship might be even closer. For seven days he had given alms to the Buddha and one thousand monks, and on the seventh day he asked the Buddha to take his meals regularly at the palace with five hundred monks; but the Buddha refused the request and appointed Ananda to take his place. Ananda came daily with five hundred others, but the king was too busy to look after them, and the monks, feeling neglected, failed to come any more, only Ananda keeping to his undertaking. When the king became aware of this he was greatly upset, and determined to win the confidence of the monks by marrying a kinswoman of the Buddha. He therefore sent messages to the Sákyan chiefs, who were his vassals, asking for the hand of one of their daughters. The Sákyans discussed the proposition in their Mote-Hall, and held it beneath the dignity of their clan to accede to it. But, unwilling to incur the wrath of their overlord, they sent him Vásabha khattiyá, daughter of Mahánáma and of a slave woman, Nágamundá. By her, Pasenadi had a son Vidúdabha. When the latter visited Kapilavatthu, he heard by chance of the fraud that had been practised on his father and vowed vengeance. When he came to the throne, he invaded the Sákyan territory and killed a large number of the clan without distinction of age or sex (DhA.i.339ff.; J.i.133f.; iv.144ff). It is said that when Pasenadi heard of the antecedents of Vásabhakhattiyá, he withdrew the royal honours, which had been bestowed on her and her son and reduced them to the condition of slaves. But the Buddha, hearing of this, related to Pasenadi the Katthahárika Játaka, and made him restore the royal honors to the mother and her son. Mention is made of another son of Pasenadi, named Brahmadatta, who entered the Order and </data>
<data>became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThagA.i.460; the Dulva says that Jeta, owner of Jetavana, was also Pasenadi's son (Rockhill, p.48).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi's sister, Kosaladeví, was married to Bimbisára. Mahákosala gave her a village in Kási as part of her dowry, for her bathmoney. When Ajátasattu killed Bimbisára, Kosaladeví died of grief, and Pasenadi confiscated the Kási village, saying that no patricide should own a village which was his by right of inheritance. Angered at this, Ajátasattu declared war upon his aged uncle. At first, victory lay with Ajátasattu, but Pasenadi had spies who reported to him a plan of attack suggested by the Thera Dhanuggaha Tissa, in the course of a conversation with his colleague Mantidatta, and in the fourth campaign Pasenadi took Ajátasattu prisoner, and refused to release him until he renounced his claim to the throne. Upon his renunciation, Pasenadi not only gave him his daughter Vajirá in marriage, but conferred on her, as a wedding gift, the very village in dispute (J.ii.237, 403; iv.342f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, Vidúdabha revolted against his father. In this he was helped by the commander in chief, Díghakáráyana, nephew of Bandhula (q.v.). Bandhula, chief of the Mallas, disgusted with the treachery of his own people, had sought refuge with his former classmate, Pasenadi, in Sávatthi. Bandhula's wife, Malliká, bore him thirty two sons, brave and learned. Pasenadi, having listened to the tales of his corrupt ministers, contrived to have Bandhula and all his sons killed while they were away quelling a frontier rebellion. BandhuIa's wife was a devout follower of the Buddha's faith, and showed no resentment against the king for this act of treachery. This moved the king's heart, and he made all possible amends. But Díghakáráyana never forgave him, and once when Pasenadi was on a visit to the Buddha at Medatalumpa (Ulumpa), </data>
<data>leaving the royal insignia with his commanderin chief, Díghakáráyana took advantage of this opportunity, withdrew the king's bodyguard, leaving behind only one single horse and one woman servant, hurried back to the capital and crowned Vidúdabha king. When Pasenadi heard of this, he hurried on to Rájagaha to enlist Ajátasattu's support; but as it was late, the city gates were closed. Exhausted by his journey, he lay down in a hall outside the city, where he died during the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ajátasattu heard the news, he performed the funeral rites over the king's body with great pomp. He wished to march at once against Vidúdabha, but desisted on the advice of his ministers (M.ii.118; MA.ii.753ff.; DhA.i.353ff.; J.iv.150ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi had a sister, Sumaná, who was present at his first interview with the Buddha and decided to enter the Order, but she delayed doing so as she then had to nurse their aged grandmother. Pasenadi was very fond of his grandmother, and was filled with grief when she died in her one hundred and twentieth year. After her death, Sumaná became a nun and attained arahantship (ThigA.22; S.i.97; A.iii.32). The old lady's possessions were given over to the monks, the Buddha giving special permission for them to be accepted (Vin.ii.169).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the king's most valued possessions was the elephant Seta (A.iii.345); he had two other elephants, Bhadderaka (or Páveyyaka) (DhA.iv.25) and Pundaríka (Ibid., ii.1). Mention is also made (J.iii.134f ) of a pet heron which lived in the palace and conveyed messages. Tradition says (SA.i.115; J.i.382ff ) that Pasenadi had in his possession the octagonal gem which Sakka had given to Kusa. He valued it greatly, using it as his turban jewel, and was greatly upset when it was reported lost; it was, however, recovered with the help and advice of Ananda. The Játaka Commentary23 records </data>
<data>that Pasenadi built a monastery in front of Jetavana. It was called the Rájakáráma, and the Buddha sometimes stayed there (J.ii.15). According to Hiouen Thsang, Pasenadi also built a monastery for Pajápati Gotamí (Beal, Records ii.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi's chaplain, Aggidatta (q.v.) had originally been Mahákosala's chaplain. Pasenadi therefore paid him great respect. This inconvenienced Aggidatta, and he gave his wealth to the poor and renounced the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DhA.iii.241ff.; SNA. (580) says that Bávarí was Mahákosala's chaplain and Pasenadi studied under him. When Pasenadi came to the throne, Bávarí declared his wish to leave the world. The king tried to prevent him but failed; he did, however, persuade Bávarí to live in the royal park. Bávarí, after staying there for some time, found life in a city uncongenial. The king thereupon detailed two of his ministers to establish a suitable hermitage for Bávarí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi's minister, Santati (q.v.), who was once allowed to reign for a week in the king's place as reward for having quelled a frontier dispute, gave his wealth to the poor and renounced the world like Aggidatta (DhA.iii.28ff). The king was always ready to pay honour to those who had won the praise of the Buddha, as in the case of Káná (Ibid., ii.150ff), Culla Eka Sátaka (Ibid., iii.2ff ) or Angulimálá (M.ii.100); on the other hand, he did not hesitate to show his disapproval of those who disregarded the Buddha's teaching   e.g., Upananda (S.i.153f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi liked to be the foremost in gifts to the Buddha and his Order. This was why he held the Asadisadána (q.v.) under the guidance and inspiration of Malliká; but he was hurt when the Buddha's sermon of thanksgiving did not seem to him commensurate with the vast amount (fourteen crores) which he had spent. The Buddha then explained to him that this lack of </data>
<data>enthusiasm was out of consideration for the king's minister Kála. When the king learned that Kála disapproved of the lavish way in which money had been spent at the almsgiving, he banished him from the court, while he allowed the minister Junha, who had furthered the almsgiving, to rule over the kingdom for seven days (DhA.iii.188ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi seems to have enjoyed discussions on topics connected with the Dhamma. Reference has already been made to the Kosala Samyutta, which records several conversations which he held with the Buddha when visiting him in Sávatthi; even when Pasenadi was engaged in affairs of state in other parts of the kingdom, he would visit the Buddha and engage him in conversation if he was anywhere in the neighbourhood. Two such conversations are recorded in the Dhammacetiya Sutta (q.v.) and the Kannakatthala Sutta (q.v.). If the Buddha was not available, he would seek a disciple. Thus the Báhitika Sutta (q.v.) records a discussion between Pasenadi and Ananda on the banks of the Aciravatí. Once when Pasenadi was in Toranavatthu, midway between Sáketa and Sávatthi, he heard that Khemá Therí was there, and went at once to visit and talk to her (S.iv.374ff). Rhys Davids thinks (Buddhist India, p.10) that Pasenadi was evidently an official title (*38) and that the king's personal name was Agnidatta. He bases this surmise on the fact that in the Divyávadána (p. 620) the king who gave Ukkatthá to Pokkarasádi is called Agnidatta, while in the Digha Nikáya (i.87) he is called Pasenadi, and that Pasenadi is used, as a designation for several kings (*39). The evidence is, however, insufficient for any definite conclusion to be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;38 The UdA. (104) explains Pasenadi as &quot;paccantam parasenam jinátí ti = Pasenadi.&quot; According to Tibetan sources he was so called because the whole country was illuminated at the time of his birth (Rockhill, p. </data>
<data>16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;39 E.g., in Dvy. 369, for a king of Magadha and again in the Kathásaritságara i.268, 298.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anágatavamsa (J.P.T.S. 1886, p. 37), Pasenadi is a Bodhisatta. He will be the fourth future Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;The Sutta Vibhanga (Vin.iv.298) mentions a Cittágára (?

The four others were children of four of the other brahmins. They had been advised by their fathers to watch Gotama's career and to join him should he renounce the world. This they did, and all five joined in the austerities of Gotama at  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvelaa')"&gt;Uruvelá&lt;/a&gt;. When he abandoned his austerities and started to follow the Middle Way, they left him in disappointment. But after the Enlightenment, the Buddha visited them and preached to them. At first they refused to pay heed to him, but gradually his powers of persuasion won their hearts and they became his first disciples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that, although warned by their fathers of the great destiny awaiting Gotama, they were yet reluctant to accept the Buddha's claim to Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.i.57, 67, 81, 82; DhA.i.87, etc. For details of the members of the group, see under their several names; see also article by Mrs. Rhys Davids in J.R.A.S. for 1927 on them as the &quot;Unknown co founders of </data>

He was a devoted follower of the Buddha and loved discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bahuvedaniya Sutta (M.i.396ff.; see also S.iv.223f) is based on a discussion between him and Mahá Udáyi, which discussion Ananda overheard and repeated to the Buddha. On another occasion, Pañcakanga related to the Buddha the conversation he had had with the Paribbájaka Uggáhamána Samanamandikáputta, and the Buddha preached to him the Samanamandiká Sutta (M.ii.23ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anuruddha Sutta (M.iii.144ff) contains a discussion between Anuruddha and Abhiya Kaccána, which took place at Pañcakanga's house, whither he had invited them. The discussion was started by a question asked by Pañcakanga. Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.629; SA.iii.86) that Pañcakanga was the Thapati's personal name, and that he was so called (&quot;Five tools&quot;) because he carried the five tools of a carpenter: vásípharasu (adze), nikhádana (chisel), danda (measuring stick), muggara (gavel), and kálasutta (blackened thread).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Patipújiká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman of Sávatthi, who once had belonged to the retinue of the god Málábhárí, and passed out of her deva existence while sitting on the branch of a tree picking flowers for him. She remembered her former existence, and yearned to rejoin Málábhárí even after she was married, hence her name. With this object in view she did many good deeds, and is said to have developed simultaneously the fifty six qualities of goodness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gave birth to four sons, and dying one day of a sudden illness, was reborn into the retinue of Málábhári.She was greatly agitated on hearing her story and realizing how short is the span of human life.

Two Pacceka Brahmás, Subrahmá and Suddhávása, came to see the Buddha, but finding him engaged in meditation, decided to visit a certain infatuated (pamatta) Brahmá in a certain Brahma world. On their suggesting to him that he should visit the Buddha, he reproduced himself one thousand times and said he had greater iddhi power than the Buddha. But Subrahmá reproduced himself two thousand times, and pointed out that the Buddha's iddhi power exceeded theirs. It is said that the infatuated Brahmá visited the Buddha later. S.i.146f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Another name for the Appaka Sutta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He belonged to the family of Párásara, hence his name. He was a teacher of many brahmins up to the time of his witnessing the miracles attending the Buddha's visit to Rájagaha. Thereupon he joined the Order and shortly after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Piyadasí Buddha he was a hunter, and while hunting in the forest, he saw the Buddha in meditation, and erected a hut over him, covering it with lilies. For seven days he renewed the supply of flowers. On the seventh day a large concourse of humans and devas assembled to hear the Buddha preach. The hunter listened to the sermon, and was born after death in the deva world (Thag.vs.116; ThagA.i.229 ff). He is probably identical with Padumakútágárlya of the Apadána (Ap.i.326ff). v.l. Párápariya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Párásariya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin teacher mentioned in the Indriyabhávaná Sutta.

He is perhaps identical with Párápariya Thera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Párásariya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin teacher of Takkasilá, mentioned in the Cúlánandiya Játaka.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pandara Játaka (No. 518)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ship was once wrecked in mid ocean and only a man called Karambiya survived. He was cast upon an island, where he wandered about naked and destitute. The people thought he was an ascetic and built him a hermitage. Among his followers were a Garuda king, and also a Nága king named Pandara (or Pandaraka). One day, at the instigation of the Garuda, the ascetic wheedled out of Pandara the secret of how the Nágas prevented themselves from being carried off by the Garudas. They swallowed large stones, thus making themselves very heavy. If the Garudas seized them by their tails, they would have to disgorge the stones and could easily be carried off. Karambiya betrayed this secret to the Garuda king who, thereupon, seized Pandara in the right way and carried him away. Pandara begged for mercy, and the Garuda set him free, warning him never again to tell his secret. Thereafter the Garuda and Pandara lived as friends. Pandara cursed Karambiya and his head split in seven pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the wickedness of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;, who is identified with Karambiya.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandara was Sáriputta and the Garuda the Bodhisatta.

She was once a householder's daughter in a village near Benares; one day, while guarding her father's field, she saw a Pacceka Buddha, and gave him a lotus with five hundred grains of fried rice (lájá), making a wish to have five hundred sons. At that moment, five hundred hunters who stood by gave honey and flesh to the Pacceka Buddha and expressed their wish to be her sons. Later, she was born in a lotus pond, within a lotus. An ascetic, seeing her, brought her up. Wherever she went, lotuses sprang up at her every footstep. The King of Benares, hearing of her made her his chief consort. She gave birth to five hundred sons, the eldest being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapaduma')"&gt;Mahápaduma&lt;/a&gt;. All of them became Pacceka Buddhas (MA.ii.889).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikáya Commentary mentions that Padumavatí was a previous birth of the Therí Uppalavanná, and gives her story with much greater detail (i.188ff.; see s.v. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uppalavanna')"&gt;Uppalavanná&lt;/a&gt;, also ThigA.185ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

But being fond both of the man and the woman concerned, he asked advice of his counselor, the Bodhisatta, in a riddle   that a pretty lake at the foot of a hill was being used by a jackal, while the lion lay quiet through it all. The counsellor's answer was that all creatures drink at will of a mighty river, yet the river is a river for all that. The king understood the answer and advised both those concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to the king of Koala who had detected a similar happening in his court.

One day, having earned some money in a fete in the city, he sat down on the bank of the river, eating and drinking with his wife. He became drunk, and fastening his lute round his neck, he went with his wife down to the river. The water filled his lute and he began to sink. His wife thereupon let go of his hand and came out of the river. Seeing him about to drown, the wife begged of him one song wherewith to earn her living. He sang her a stanza to the effect that the water of the Ganges, which was the salvation of many, proved to be his bane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was among those related by the Bodhisatta in the Padakusalamánava Játaka (J.iii.507f). The Párupanas made the use of this story in poking fun at the Ekamsikas, because the texts chosen by the Ekamsikas to prove their case proved just the contrary (see Bode, op cit., 76, n. 3.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pandukambalasilásana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The throne of Sakka, which stands under the Páricchattaka Kovilára tree and is sixty leagues long, fifty broad and fifteen deep. Sakka, sitting on it, sinks as far as the middle of his body. It is the colour of the jayasumana flower (DA.ii.482). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha occupied the seat when he visited Távatimsa to preach to his mother. It is said that Sakka feared the seat might prove too high for the Buddha, but the Buddha, perceiving his thoughts, sat on it, covering the whole with a fold of his robe (DhA.iii.217; iv.80). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is also made (J.ii.193) of the Buddha occupying the seat on a subsequent visit to Távatimsa. Distinguished guests of Sakka, such as Sádhína (J.iv.357), were allowed to sit on the throne by Sakka's side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sakka's span of life draws near its end, or his merit is exhausted, or a righteous being is in danger and needs his help, the Pandukambalasilásana becomes heated, thus attracting his attention. (E.g., J.iv.8 f., 238, 323; iii.53; v.92, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is so called because it resembled a red blanket (rattakambala). MNidA.313.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was a great debater who wandered from place to place, carrying a jambu branch, which he set up where he stopped, challenging anyone, who wished to engage him in disputation, to dislodge it.

Pasúra, followed by a large crowd, went to Sáriputta's lodgings and had a discussion with him, in which he suffered defeat (cf. &lt;a href="patacara')"&gt;Patácárá&lt;/a&gt;). Later, he joined the Order under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laludayi_th')"&gt;Lá&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laludayi_th')"&gt;ludáyí&lt;/a&gt;, whom he defeated in discussion, and having returned in his monk's robes to the dwelling of the heretics, he started off in these same robes to visit the Buddha and hold a discussion with him. But as he entered &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, the deity presiding over the gate made him dumb, and he had to sit before the Buddha, unable to utter a single word in answer to his questions. The Buddha thereupon preached the Pasúra Sutta (see below) before the assembled people. SNA.ii.538ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pasúra Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eighth sutta of the Atthaka Vagga of the Sutta Nipáta. Preached to Pasúra at Jetavana. Disputants quarrel with each other and call each other fools; they wish for praise and, failing to get it, become discontented. No one is purified by dispute (SN.vs.824, 834). This sutta is commented on in the Mahá Niddesa (pp. 161ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Before agreeing to give her in marriage, her father wished to test her virtue, lest she should bring disgrace on his name. He took her into the forest and whispered to her words of love. When she expressed her horror, he was convinced of her innocence and agreed to the marriage. The Bodhisatta was a Treesprite and witnessed the incident. The story was related to a greengrocer in Sávatthi who treated his daughter in a similar way. He later visited the Buddha and told him the story. The characters were identical in both cases.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Páricchattaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tree in Távatimsa, which grew in the Nandanavana as the result of the Kovilára tree planted by Magha outside the Sudhammásálá. It is one hundred leagues in circumference and at its foot is the Pandukambalasilásana (DhA.i.273). The Cittapátali in the Asura world corresponds to the Páricchattaka in Távatimsa, but the flowers are different (Ibid., 280; SNA.485). The colour of the flowers is visible fifty leagues away, while their perfume travels one hundred leagues. The devas eagerly watch each stage of development of leaf and flower, and each stage is marked by great rejoicings (A.iv.117f). When the flowers are fully open they shine like the morning sun. They are never plucked; a wind arises and sweeps away the faded flowers and scatters fresh ones on the seats of Sakka and the other gods of Távatimsa. The bodies of the devas are completely covered with the sweetly scented pollen, making them resemble golden caskets. The ceremony of playing with the flowers lasts four months (AA.ii.730f). The Páricchattaka is one of the seven trees which last throughout the kappa (AA.i.264).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Páricchattaka is generally described as a Kovilára (E.g., VvA. 174). It is also called the Párijáta, the Sanskrit name being Páriyátra. E.g., Dvy.184, 195, 219.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

She served Vessavana for three years and was given leave to eat people within a certain range. One day she caught a rich and handsome brahmin, and, falling in love with him, made him her husband. When she went out she shut him up, lest he should escape. The Bodhisatta was born as their son, and, on learning his father's story, discovered from the yakkha how far her power extended, and then escaped with his father. The yakkha followed, but they were outside her territory and would not be persuaded to return. She gave her son a charm enabling him to trace the footsteps of any person, even after the lapse of twelve years. On the strength of his charm, the lad entered the service of the king of Benares. One day, the king and his chaplain, wishing to test him, stole some treasure, took it away by devious paths, and hid it in a tank. The youth recovered it quite easily, tracing their footsteps even in the air. The king wished the names of the thieves to be divulged, but this the boy would not do. But he related to the king various stories, showing that he knew the real culprits. The king, however, insisted on the thieves being denounced, and when the boy revealed their names, the assembled populace murdered the king and his chaplain and crowned the Bodhisatta as king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a seven year old boy of Sávatthi who could recognize footsteps. His father put him through a severe test, and then went to the Buddha, where the boy found him. When the Buddha heard the story he revealed that of the past. The father of the story of the past is identified with Mahá Kassapa. J.iii.501 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He is also possessed of unwavering faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and sees the Ariyan truth of the Causal Law. He thus begets confidence regarding his ultimate destiny.

The boy called at Páthika's hermitage on the way, and the ascetic tried to dissuade him from going. Failing to do so, he told him not to tell the Buddha where to find the house, hoping that thus they would be able to eat themselves all the food prepared for the Buddha. The boy did as he was told, and the next day he and Páthika hid in a room at the back of the house. The Buddha came, and, after the meal, thanked the woman.

He came to understand the speech of animals, and thus learned from a she jackal whom he had offended that a hostile king with whom he would have to fight would march on to the city. His father bore him no love, and sent him to fight this king when he arrived. But all the citizens followed the prince, and his father, very alarmed, retired into the forest with his queen, his chaplain, and a servant, named &lt;a href="parantapa')"&gt;Parantapa&lt;/a&gt;, and lived in a hut. When the king and the chaplain went for fruit, the queen, though with child by the king, sinned with Parantapa and instigated him to kill the king while on his way to bathe in the river. The chaplain watched this deed but said nothing, and on his return feigned to have been suddenly blinded by a snake's breath. The queen bore a son, and when he was sixteen, the chaplain told him of what had happened and taught him the use of a sword. Soon after, the boy killed Parantapa and returned with his mother and the chaplain to Benares, where the Bodhisatta made him his viceroy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta's&lt;/a&gt; attempts to kill the Buddha.

He was the son of Brahmadatta, and was named Pañcávudha-kumára because eight hundred brahmins prophesied that he would win glory through prowess in arms. He studied in Takkasilá, and, at the end of his course, his teacher gave him a set of five weapons. On the way home he had a conflict with an ogre named Silesaloma, against whom his weapons were of no avail, as they could not penetrate the ogre's hair. But he fought on, and the ogre, marvelling at his courage and his fearlessness, set him free. He thereupon preached to the ogre and converted him. Pañcávudha later became king of Benares. J.i.272ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ogre is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angulimaala')"&gt;Angulimála&lt;/a&gt;.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Paribbájaká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to the ascetics and recluses (not otherwise classified) of the Buddha's time. They were not exclusively brahmin. Their presence seems to have been recognized and respected from earlier times. Generally speaking, their creed is formulated as a belief in perfect bliss after death for the self purged from evil, and as a conviction that this bliss can be won by brahmacariyá, by freedom from all evil in acts, words, aims, and mode of livelihood (See, e.g., M.ii.24). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these four standards of conduct were bodily incorporated in the Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path, and the last of the four gave to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aajiivakaa')"&gt;Ajívakas&lt;/a&gt; their specific name as a separate sect. The Paribbájakas claimed to be identical with the followers of the Buddha in their tenets and teaching (E.g., M.i.64f, 84f), but the Buddha maintained that the two teachings were quite distinct. This is clearly indicated (E.g.,Vin.i.39.) in connection with the conversion of Sáriputta and Moggallána, who were Paribbájakas under&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjaya')"&gt;Sañjaya&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the Paribbájakas was deathlessness (amata) which, to them, probably meant birth in the world of Brahmá. Their conversion to the Buddha's Doctrine followed the recognition that Gotama dealt, not with effects but with causes, and that he went to the root of the matter by teaching how casual states of consciousness arose and how they could be banished for ever. (Chalmers: Further Dialogues i. Introd. xxi. For discussions on the views of the Paribbájakas as compared with those of the Buddha, see also A.iv.35ff., 378; i.215).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Paribbájakas were not ascetics except in so far as they were celibates; some of them were women. They were teachers or sophists who </data>
<data>spent eight or nine months of every year wandering from place to place for the purpose of engaging in friendly, conversational discussions on matters of ethics and philosophy, nature lore and mysticism. They differed very much in intelligence, earnestness, and even in honesty. Some of the views discussed in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmajala_s')"&gt;Brahmajála Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, and described as those of &quot;Eel wrigglers&quot; and &quot;Hair splitters&quot;, were undoubtedly truly thus described. The books mention halls erected for the accommodation of the Paribbájakas, such as those in Malliká's park at Sávatthi (D.i.178), and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa')"&gt;Kútágárasálá&lt;/a&gt; at Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes special places were set apart for them in the groves near the settlements, as &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaa')"&gt;Campá&lt;/a&gt; on the bank of the   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gaggaraa')"&gt;Gaggará lake&lt;/a&gt; (Ibid., 111),  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/moranivapa')"&gt;Moranivápa&lt;/a&gt; in   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; (A.v.326), and   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;on the banks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sappini')"&gt;Sappiniká&lt;/a&gt; (Ibid., i.185; ii.175).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in such places that the Paribbájakas met each other, and in the course of their journeys they would visit each other in order to exchange greetings of courtesy and to engage in profitable discussion. The utmost cordiality seems to have prevailed on these occasions, intercourse and discussions were free, there were no restrictions of creed, caste or pride.

The names of a considerable number of Paribbájakas, besides those already mentioned, who were well known in the time of the Buddha, are given in the texts (e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/annabhaara')"&gt;Annabhára&lt;/a&gt;, Varadhara, etc., A.ii.175), also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samandaka')"&gt;Sámandaka&lt;/a&gt; (S.iv.26) and the Paribbájiká &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sucimukhii')"&gt;Sucimukhí&lt;/a&gt; (S.iii.238f).

They reported that Gotama was taking his meal under the shadow of the Pandavapabbata. There Bimbisára visited him and requested him to share his kingdom. Gotama told Bimbisára of his antecedents, that he was a Sákyan of Kosala and had renounced all pleasures, seeing ill in them (SN.vs.405 24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (SNA.ii.381) that the Sutta was preached by Ananda at Jetavana, because he desired to give an account of the renunciation of the Buddha, similar to that of Sáriputta and others. The Commentary adds (p.386) that at the end of the talk with the Buddha, Bimbisára asked him to visit Rájagaha as soon as he had attained Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the son of the eldest of the three brothers, Mánábharana, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha, who ruled over Dakkhinadesa and Rohana. He was born at Punkhagáma in the Dakkhinadesa, where Mánábharana was ruler. His birth was accompanied by various miracles. Vikkamabáhu II., the then reigning king at Pulatthipura, hearing of this, wished to bring the boy up at his own court and make him his heir in place of his own son. But Mánábharana refused to consent to this, and soon after died. Thereupon his brother Kittisirimegha took over Dakkhinadesa and left Rohana to Sirivallabha, who brought Mánábharana's widow Ratnávalí with her two daughters Mittá and Pabhávatí and her son Parakkama, to his capital of Mahánágakula. Meanwhile Vikkamabáhu dies and is succeeded by his son Gajabáhu, who maintains his position in spite of the attacks of Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha. Parakkama, finding no scope for his talents in Rohana, seeks his uncle Kittisirimegha, who receives him joyfully and takes him to live in his capital at Sankhatthalí. There Parakkama finishes his education, and his coming of age is celebrated under the direction of the Senápati Sankha of Badalatthalí. Sirivallabha dies in Rohana and is succeeded by his son, the younger Mánábharana. Parakkama's ambitious spirit makes him restless, and he is discontented at the prospect of serving a petty principality. He wishes to seek royal dignity in Rájarattha, and refuses to listen to his uncle's dissuasion, who assures him that he is only influenced by his love for him and fears for his safety. But Parakkama leaves Sankhatthalí secretly and goes to Badalatthalí, where the general Sankha is slain because he informed the king of Parakkama's flight. </data>
<data>Parakkama then goes to Buddhagáma 'near the frontiers of the Rájarattha. The inhabitants make repeated attempts to check his advance, but he repels these by his valour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Kittisirimegha, after consultation with his ministers, sends a stronger force to try and overcome him, but the force is ambushed by the prince and completely routed after a night assault in Khíravápi. Parakkama then goes to Rájarattha, where messengers with gifts from Gajabáhu meet him, the latter following to greet him in person and bring him to the capital. Parakkama lives at the court in Pulatthipura, but spends his time in spying out the country and intriguing with his host's subjects. In order to lull the suspicions of Gajabáhu, he gives him his sister Bhaddavatí in marriage, keeping her dowry in his own hands. Later, feeling his position insecure, he returns to Dakkhinadesa, meeting on the way with all kinds of adventures which put his courage to the test. Kittisirimegha, delighted to hear of his return, sends messengers to Saraggáma to meet him. But Parakkama hesitates to enter the capital until persuaded by his mother to do so. Shortly after, Kittisirimegha dies and Parakkama succeeds to the throne. He consolidates his position by various captures, including that of Gajabáhu, which follows on the storming of Pulatthipura. But Mánábharana comes to the rescue, defeats Parakkama's army, and sets Gajabáhu free; but the latter, finding him unbearable, appeals to Parakkama for help. War ensues, and Gajabáhu, again at liberty, flees, while his officers fight with Parakkama. Utimately he abdicates in favour of the latter, and dies at Gangátata. His ministers, however, send for Mánábharana, while Parakkama hastens to Pulatthipura, where he is crowned. A campaign of varying fortunes ensues ending in the defeat of Mánábharana, who flees to his own country, where </data>
<data>he dies. Parakkama is then crowned a second time. Parakkama is now sole monarch, but his rule is not universally acceptable. In the fourth year of his reign, Sugalá, mother of Mánábharana, raises the standard of revolt in Rohana. The campaign against her is a protracted one and is conducted by the general Rakkha. In the early part of the campaign the Tooth and Bowl Relies are recovered and brought with great ceremony to Pulatthipura. The rebels are gradually cornered and defeated. Sugalá is captured, and the revolt collapses. Rohana is quiet for a time, but rises again after some years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the twelfth year of his reign, Parakkama goes to war with the king of Rámañña, disputes having arisen about the elephant trade and the treatment of the Sinhalese ambassadors, the crowning offence being the seizing of a princess who was being sent from Ceylon to Kamboja. A fleet is collected at Pallavavanka, and the soldiers are landed at the port of Kusumí, with the Nagaragiri Kitti at their head, a further attack being made by the Damiládhikarin Ádicca at Papphálama. After five months the Rámañña king is slain and peace again restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the Pandu king Parakkama being besieged by the Cola king Kulasekhara, appeals for help from Ceylon. Parakkamabáhu sends an army under his general Lankápura, but, in the meantime, the Pandu king has been slain and his capital Madhurá taken. The Sinhalese army, however, landed on the opposite coast and carried on a war against the Colas, and built a fortress called Parakkamapura. As a result of this campaign, Kulasekhara was defeated and the Pandu king's son, Vírapandu, was crowned in the ancient capital. The Cola prisoners were sent to Ceylon and employed in repairing the Ratanaváluka cetiya. The village of Panduvijaya was founded by Parakkama to commemorate the victory. The ultimate outcome of this expedition is </data>
<data>not certain. The Cola records claim that Lankápura was defeated, and that his head was nailed to the gates of Madhurá together with those of his generals. The war of the Pandyan succession did not end there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parakkamabáhu now engaged in more peaceful pursuits and, after some trouble, he succeeded in reconciling the three sects of monks   the Mahávihára, the Abhayagiri and the Jetavana   and held a convocation under a thera called Mahá Kassapa. The Vaitulya heresy now finally disappeared from Ceylon. The king built for the use of the monks the Jetavanáráma, including a round Temple of the Tooth, in the vicinity of the royal palace, and, further to the north, he constructed the Áláhana Parivena, the Lankátilaka vihára and the Baddhasímápásáda. He also built the Pacchimáráma, the Uttáráráma and the Mahá Thúpa (or Damila Thúpa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the three suburbs he built the Isipatana, the Kusináráráma and the Veluvana viháras, and, in addition, the Kapila vihára, while he restored the shrines at Anurádhapura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parakkamabáhu   also enlarged and fortified Pulatthipura and adorned the city with numerous palaces and pleasure gardens. He paid great attention to irrigation, opening the Ákásagangá and forming or improving a system of irrigation, its centre being in the Parakkama samudda, and building numerous tanks throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internal peace of the latter half of his reign was disturbed only by a rebellion near Mahátittha, this being easily quelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parakkamabáhu I. was succeeded by his sister's son, Vijayabahu II. According to the Nikáyasangraha, Parakkama was born after death as the god Naradeva in the Himálaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaps. 62 79 of the Cv. are devoted to a description of Parakkamabáhu and his reign. The above is a very concise account of the contents </data>
<data>of these chapters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Parakkamabáhu&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Vijayabáhu III. and brother of Bhuvanekabáhu. He was born at Sirivaddhana, and, in his youth, was entrusted to the care of the monks under Sangharakkhita. On the death of his father he ascended the throne, and reigned for thirty three years (1236 68), at Jambuddoni, as Parakkamabáhu II. On account of his profound erudition, he received the sobriquet of Kalikála Sáhicca sabbaññupandita (&quot;the scholar entirely familiar with literature in the Dark Age&quot;). The first act of his reign was the bringing of the Tooth Relic from the Billa mountain to the capital, amidst the exhibition of various miracles. He then set about regaining Pulatthipura from the Tamils, with Mághinda and Jayabáhu at their head, and this was accomplished by 1244. In the eleventh year of his reign Ceylon was invaded by a Jávaka (Javanese) named Candabhánu, probably a sea robber with a large force. The attack was repulsed by Vírabáhu, the king's nephew, but Candabhánu appeared again later. The rest of Parakkama's life was devoted to pious works. He invited Cola monks over to Ceylon and held a convocation, with the object of reforming the priesthood, and showed special honour to Dhammakitti, a monk of Tambarattha. Among buildings erected by him were the Bhuvenakabáhu parivena at Billasela and the Mahámahindabáhu parivena at Hatthiselapura. He also restored the viháras at Kalyáni and at Hatthavangalla. He added to the Sirivijayasundaravihára built by his father and inaugurated a yearly festival in Devanagara. He made a pilgrimage to Samantakúta and erected a bridge, so that pilgrims might reach it more easily. In all these works he was assisted by his minister Devappatirája. Parakkama had five sons: Vijayabáhu, Bhuvanekabáhu, Tibhuvanamalla, Parakkamabáhu and Jayabáhu. In his old age he </data>
<data>abdicated in favour of his son Vijayabáhu, who, because of his piety, was called Bodhisatta. Cv., chaps. 81 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Parakkamabáhu&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the five sons of Parakkamabáhu II. Nothing further is known of him. Cv.lxxxvii.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Parakkamabáhu&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Vijayabáhu IV. and grandson of Parakkamabáhu II. He became king about 1302 A.C., but the length of his reign is not known: He paid a visit to the Pándyan king and recovered the Tooth and Bowl Relies which had been carried away by Ariyacakkavatti. They were restored to Pulatthipura (Cv.xc.48ff). It may be conjectured that Parakkama secured the Relies at the price of vassalage to the Pándyan court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Parakkamabáhu&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Bhuvanekabáhu II. He became king in Hatthiselapura as Parakkamabáhu IV. in about 1325 A.C. The length of his reign is unknown. He paid great honour to the Tooth Relic and is said to have written, in Sinhalese, a work called the Ceremonial of the Tooth Relic (Dáthádhátucáritta). Cv. xc.64f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Parakkamabáhu V. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (Cv.xc.1; see Codrington, op. cit., 83, 89, and Cv. Trs. ii. 212, n. 1). He was, perhaps, the brother of Bhuvanekabáhu IV., and, probably, had his capital at Gangásiripura. The period of his reign is not definitely known, but it was somewhere between 1348 and 1360 A.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;7. Parakkamabáhu VI. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (Cv.xci.16ff.; see also Cv. Trs., ii.215, n. 1; and Codrington, op. cit., 90f). He ruled at Jayavaddhanapura. The Cúlavamsa tells us nothing of importance except that his mother was Sunettá. We gather from other sources that his father was Vijayabáhu, but the authenticity of this information is doubtful. The date of his accession is also uncertain. </data>
<data>Some place it at 1412 A.C., others at 1415 A.C. At the beginning of his reign he lived for three years at Rájagáma, moving later to Jayavaddhanapura. Among his religious works were the restoration of the monasteries at Gandáladoni and Lankátilaka, and the building of a temple of the Tooth in his capital, Also the founding of the Sunettá parivena in honour of his mother. He abdicated in favour of his sister's son, Vira Parakkamabáhu, and died after a reign of fifty five years. His reign is noted for a great output of Sinhalese literature, particularly of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;8. Parakkamabáhu VII. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called Pandita Parakkamabáhu, son of Bhuvanekabáhu VI. (Cv.xcii.3). He reigned for four years (circa 1480 84 A.C.), and was slain by his uncle who became king as Víra Parakkamabáhu. Codrington, op. cit., 94f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;9. Parakkamabáhu VIII. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called Víra Parakkamabáhu, uncle of Parakkamabáhu VII. (Cv.xcii.3). He seems to have ruled from about 1484-1509 A.C. He had constant trouble with his relations. His successor's name is uncertain. Codrington, op. cit., 94f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;10. Parakkamabáhu IX. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called Dhamma Parakkamabáhu. He is not mentioned in the Cúlavamsa, but probably ruled somewhere about 1509 28 A.C. Codrington, op. cit., 95f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Pañcálacanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A devaputta who visited the Buddha at Jetavana and uttered a verse to the effect that the man who understands jhána finds room even among crowding obstacles. The Buddha corrects him, saying that those who are mindful and self possessed know the way to Nibbána (S.i.48). This discussion forms the basis for the Pañcála Sutta (above.) It is probably this same deva who is mentioned as a Maháyakkha in the Atánátiya Sutta (D.iii.205) who is to be invoked by the Buddha's followers in time of need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pañcálacanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handsome brahmin youth with whom the queen of a Kosala king misconducted herself on various occasions.

J.v.425, 430f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Pañcálacanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former birth of kunála. He was the chaplain of Kandari, king of Benares, and helped the king in discovering the love intrigues of his queen, Kinnará, with a misshapen cripple. When Kandari wished to have the queen beheaded, Pañcálacanda interceded on her behalf and convinced the king, by recalling to his mind several experiences they had lived through together, that the queen's sin was due to her nature as woman. J.v.437ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Pañcálacanda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Cúlaní Brahmadatta. He was sent by Mahosadha to be kept as hostage to King Videha, when Cúlaní threatened to harm the latter; but Videha treated him like a younger brother. Pañcálacandí was sister to Pañcálacanda.

When Cullapála, brother of Cakkhupála, heard of the latter's blindness, he sent Pálita to fetch him, and, in order to protect him from danger on the way, had him ordained before he set forth. While returning with Cakkhupála, Pálita heard the song of a woman collecting firewood, and, making some excuse, left Cakkhupála and had intimacy with her.

He was a Sákyan of Devadaha and was called Sammoda, but in his boyhood he suffered from rheumatism (vátaroga) and was crippled for some time; hence he came to be called Pakkha (cripple) even after his recovery. When the Buddha visited his kinsfolk he entered the Order and lived in the forest. One day he saw a kite flying up into the sky with some flesh, from which first one kite and then another grabbed a piece. Reflecting that worldly desires were like the flesh taken by the kite, he developed insight and attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he had been a Yakkha senápati with a retinue of eighty four thousand and had given the Buddha a divine robe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen kappas ago he was sixteen times cakkavatti under the name of Suváhana (Váham).

The word &quot;paritta&quot; means protection. The Milinda-Pañha (p.150f) gives a list of the chief Parittas: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/ratana_sutta')"&gt;Ratana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khandha_paritta_v_sam')"&gt;Khandha-paritta,  &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/m5_mu')"&gt;Mora paritta, &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhajagga_s')"&gt;Dhajagga paritta, &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aataanaatiya_s')"&gt;Atánátiya paritta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angulimaala')"&gt;Angulimála&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(for particulars of these see s.v.; also   Dial.iii.185). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To these are generally added, in the extant collection of Parittas, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mangala_s')"&gt;Mangala Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metta_sutta')"&gt;Metta Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word paritta first occurs in the Culla Vagga (Vin.ii.110) in connection with the Khandha-paritta, which was allowed by the Buddha as a watch, a guard, a protection for oneself, for the use of the Order. The occasion of the delivery of this general injunction was the death of a monk from snake bite. The Milinda-Pañha states (see above) that the recital of the Paritta had the Buddha's express sanction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection of Parittas is, to this day, more widely known by the laity of Burma and Ceylon than any other Páli book, and is </data>
<data>generally used in times of danger or of sickness, both individual and national. Thus, Sena II., king of Ceylon, made the community of monks recite the Paritta, and by sprinkling the water charmed with Paritta he made the people free from illness, and so removed the danger of plague from the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also decreed that this practice should continue every year (Cv.li.80).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa V. is said to have had a Paritta ceremony performed by the three fraternities of monks to protect his people from danger and plague and bad harvest (Ibid., lii.80).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent (1935) epidemic of malaria in Ceylon, monks were taken in carts through the badly affected areas reciting the Paritta and sprinkling water. The ceremony is held on most diverse occasions such as the inauguration of a new house, the starting of a journey, of a new business, etc. For a discussion on the Paritta see Dial.iii.180 ff.; also P.L.C.75f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bode says (Op. cit., 4) that in the days of King Anorata of Burma corrupt and cynical monks used the recital of the Paritta as an easy means of clearing man's guilty conscience from all wrong doing, even from matricide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa is mentioned (Cv.xxxvii.226) as having once attempted to compile a Parittatthakathá. Geiger (Cv. Trs.i.24, 3) calls this a commentary on the Paritta, but it is more probable that paritta is here used as an adjective, meaning short, concise, and that what is meant is a short or concise commentary on the Pitakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Pandukábhaya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (377-307 B.C.). He was the son of Dighagámaní and Ummáda Cittá and was protected from death in infancy by Citta and Kálavela, who afterwards became Yakkhas. He was brought up by a man in Dváramandalaka, but several times his uncles, discovering his whereabouts, tried to kill him, for it had been foretold that he would slay his uncles in order to obtain possession of the kingdom. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to the brahmin &lt;a href="p2_ap')"&gt;Pandula&lt;/a&gt;, who taught him various arts and provided him later with the necessary money for an army. Pandula's son, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/canda')"&gt;Canda&lt;/a&gt;, was given as friend and counsellor to Pandukábhaya. Pandukábhaya married, by force, a maiden named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannapaalii')"&gt;Suvannapálí&lt;/a&gt;, and declared war upon his uncles, all of whom, except the eldest, Abhaya, had determined to slay him. With the help of the Yakkhiní Cetiyá, who dwelt in Dhúmarakkhapabbata, Pandukábhaya made all preparations for a final campaign against his uncles. For four years he lived in Dhúmarakkha, and then for seven in Aritthapabbata. Following the counsel of Cetiyá, he enticed his uncles into a trap, and slew them and their followers at Lábugámaka. He then proceeded to Anurádhagáma, where he set up his capital, which, thenceforward, came to be called Anurádhapura. His uncle, Abhaya, was made Nagaraguttika, and to him was given over the government of the city by night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After establishing peace in the land, Pandukábhaya proceeded to lay out his capital as a city, and among the buildings which he erected were hermitages for the Niganthas Jotiya, Giri and Kumbhanda, and dwellings for the Ájívakas, the brahmins, etc. He also marked out the boundaries </data>

He was born in Hamsavatí, of the khattiya Ananda and his wife Sujátá. At the moments of his birth and his Enlightenment, a shower of lotuses fell in the ten thousand worlds, hence his name. He lived as a householder for ten thousand years in three palaces: Naraváhana, Yassa (or Yasavatí) and Vasavatti. His wife was Vasudattá, by whom he had a son, Uttara (according to SNA.i.341, his son was Uparevata). He left home in his palace (Vasavatti), and practised austerities only for seven days. A maiden of Ujjeni, called Rucinandá, gave him milk rice, and the Ájívaka Sumitta gave him grass for his seat. His bodhi tree was a salala, under which he spent a week, and when he touched the ground with his foot, huge lotus flowers sprang out of the earth, covering his body completely with their pollen. (The Samyuttabhánakas give this as the reason for his name.) His first sermon was preached to his cousins Devala and Sujáta, who later became his chief disciples. The spot where the sermon was preached was Mithiluyyána. Sumana was Padumuttara's personal attendant, Amitá and Asamá his chief women disciples, Vitinna and Tissa his chief patrons among men, and Hatthá and Vicittá among women. His body was fifty eight cubits high, and his aura spread for twelve yojanas. He died in Nandáráma at the age of one hundred thousand, and a thúpa twelve leagues in height was erected over his relics. In his time, the Bodhisatta was governor of a province (ratthika) called Jatika (Jatila). Bu.xi.1ff.; BuA.157ff.; J.i.37, 44; DhA.i.99, 417; iii.146, etc.; also Ap.i.57, 63, 101, 107; Mtu.ii.58.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (E.g., MT.59) that in the time of Padumuttara there did not exist a single heretic.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Many of the eminent disciples of Gotama Buddha are said to have first conceived their desire for their respective positions in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, after seeing similar rank conferred on Padumuttara's various disciples in acknowledgment of their special attainments -  e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Aññákondañña, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahá Kassapa, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pindola Bháradvája, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Punna Mantáníputta, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahá Kaccána, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Culla Panthaka, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Subhúti, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Khadiravaniya Revata, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Kankhá Revata, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sona-Kolivisa, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sona Kutikanna, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sívalí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vakkalí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ráhula, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ratthapála, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Kundadhána, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vangísa, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Upasena, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vangantaputta, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Dabba Mallaputta, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pilinda Vaccha, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Báhiya Dárucíriya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Kumára Kassapa, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahá Kotthita, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ánanda, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Uruvela-Kassapa, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Káludáyí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sobhita, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Upáli, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Nanda, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahá Kappina, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ságata, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Rádha, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mogharájá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vappa, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Upavána, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahápajápatí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Gotamí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Khemá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Uppalavanná, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Patácárá, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Dhammadinná, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sundari Nandá, &lt;/li&gt;</data>

It was preached in reference to the divergence of views held by various teachers in Sávatthi.The king, on hearing of their constant disputes, gave orders that a company of blind men be collected and an elephant placed before them. They were then asked to touch the elephant, and each one described what it appeared like to him. Each described that part which he had touched. The king told the heretics that their divergent views were as unreliable as the blind men's descriptions of the elephant. The Buddha, hearing of this, preached the sutta in order to confirm the king's judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One should not give oneself up to philosophical speculations which lead nowhere and promote wrangles (SN.vs.796 803; SNA.ii.1529ff).

His father was the Khattiya Asama (but see J.i.36, where he is called Paduma ) and his mother Asamá. For ten thousand years he lived as a householder in three palaces: Nandá, Suyasá and Uttará (BuA. calls them Uttará, Vasuttará and Yasuttará). His wife was Uttará and his son Ramma. He left home in a chariot and practiced austerities for eight months. Dhaññavatí gave him milk rice, and an Ajívaka, named Titthaka, spread grass for his seat under his bodhi tree, which was a Mahásona. He preached his first sermon in Dhanañjuyyána. His chief disciples were his younger brothers Sála and Upasála and his attendant was Varuna. Rádhá and Surádhá were his chief women disciples, and his chief patrons were Bhiyya and Asama among men and Rucí and Nandarámá among women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His body was fifty eight cubits high, and he lived for one hundred thousand years. He died in Dhammáráma and his relics were scattered. The Buddhavamsa Commentary states that his full name was Mahápaduma, that he was so called because on the day of his birth a shower of lotuses fell over Jambudípa, and that, at that time, the Bodhisatta was a lion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bu ix.; BuA.146ff.; J.i.36; Mhv.i.7; DhA.i.84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

The Apadána Commentary explains that the building was, in fact, a gandhakuti, which was called a cetiya as a mark of respect (pújaníyabhávena), and that it was called Paduma because it was shaped like a lotus and was covered with lotuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;9. Paduma Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He once threw a lotus to Padumuttara Buddha as he was traveling through the air, and the Buddha accepted it.

He could find no one to contradict him until he came to Sávatthi, where was the Buddha. Forthwith he set off for Jetavana; but on seeing the gate towers, he fled (J.ii.216ff).

He belonged to a noble family of Rohí (Rohiní) and succeeded to his father's estate. Once, when he was holding a ceremonial oblation, a great number of people assembled, and the Buddha, arriving among them, preached from the sky, seated in a jewelled pavilion made for him by Vessavana. Paccaya heard the preaching and renounced the world, attaining arahantship in a few days, and not leaving his cell till he had developed insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that in the time of Kassapa Buddha, Paccaya was a monk who refused to leave the vihára till he gained insight, but he died before his purpose was fulfilled. Earlier, ninety one kappas ago, he had come across the Buddha Vipassí, on the banks of the Vinatá, and had offered him a fig (udumbara) (Thag. vss. 222 4; ThagA.i.341f). He is probably identical with Udumbaraphaladáyaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.295.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Párápariya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He was the son of a very eminent brahmin of Sávatthi, and was so called because the name of his family was Párápara. One day he went to Jetavana to hear the Buddha preach, and the Buddha, seeing him, preached the Indriyabhávaná Sutta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This probably refers to M.iii.298ff., which deals with the views of the brahmin teacher Párásariya, and then gives the method of developing the indriyas as taught in the Ariyan Vinaya. The sutta, however, was preached at Kajañgalá and not at Sávatthi, the questioners being Uttara, a pupil of Párásariya, and Ananda. See Brethren 295, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After learning the sutta, Párápariya pondered on its meaning and won arahantship (Thag.vs.726ff.; ThagA.ii.17f). The Theragáthá contains a number of verses (Vs.920 49; ThagA.ii.74ff) spoken by Párápariya after the Buddha's parinibbána and immediately before his own death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It adds that, according to some authorities, their desires are fulfilled by a mere look, a smile, an embrace, but this statement is rejected by the ancient Commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He and Lohitaka were leaders of a special group called the Pandukalohitaká, who are mentioned as having been guilty of various offences against Vinaya rules (Vin.ii.1, 5, 6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panduka and Lohitaka lived at Jetavana and encouraged heretics by upholding their views. The Satapatta Játaka was preached in reference to these two (MA.ii.668; J.ii.387). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were the least evil of the Chabbaggiyí. Sp.iii.614.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.

He thereupon visited him and instructed him in the various ways of overcoming somnolence.

It consisted of two divisions: &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarapancaala')"&gt;Uttara Pañcála&lt;/a&gt; and Dakkhina Pañcála. The river &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaagiirathii')"&gt;Bhagírathi&lt;/a&gt; formed the boundary between the divisions. According to the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumbhakaara_jat_408')"&gt;Kumbhakára Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Uttara Pañcála was Kampillanagara, where a king named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dummukha')"&gt;Dummukha&lt;/a&gt; once reigned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.iii.379; also Mtu.iii.26; but the Dvy. (435) calls the capital Hastinápura. According to the Mahábhárata (i.138, 73-4), the capital was Ahicchatra or Chatravatí, while the capital of Daksina-Pañcála was Kámpilya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pañcála was to the east of the Kuru country, and, in ancient times, there seems to have been a constant struggle between the Kurus and the Pañcálas for the possession of Uttara-Pañcála. Thus, sometimes, Uttara Pañcála was included in the Kuru kingdom (E.g., J.v.444; also Mahábhárata i.138), but at other times it formed a part of Kampillarattha (E.g., J.iii.79; v. 21, 289) Kampilla probably being the capital of Dakkhina Pañcála. So it happened that sometimes the kings of Kampillarattha had their capital in Uttara Pañcála nagara, while at others the kings of Uttara Pañcála-nagara had their capital in Kampilla nagara. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuulani_brahmadatta')"&gt;Cúlaní Brahmadatta&lt;/a&gt; is described in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546')"&gt;Mahá Ummagga Játaka&lt;/a&gt; as king of Pañcála, with his capital in Kampilla. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.vi.329, 396, etc.; also PvA. 161; see also </data>

Sometimes the king of Pañcála is merely spoken of as Pañcála   e.g., J.iv.430, v. 98. See also Jayaddisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been a chieftain (rájá) of Pañcála even in the Buddha's day, for we are told (ThagA.i.331) that Visákha Pañcáliputta (q.v.) was the son of the daughter of the &quot;Pañcála rájá.&quot; Pañcála is generally identified (Law: Geog. of Early Buddhism, p. 19.) with the country to the north and west of Delhi, from the foot of the Himálaya to the river Chambal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pañcála Vagga&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth section of the Navaka Nipáta of the Anguttara Nikáya.

Udáyi says that the five sensuous pleasures are the sambádha, and that okásadhigama consists in the attainment of the jhánas. A.iv.449f.; AA.ii.815.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When Cúla Sumana (q.v.) went to the lake to fetch water for his teacher, Pannaka refused to let him take it. There ensued a great struggle of iddhi power between them, in view of the many hosts of deities invoked by Sumana. In the end, Sumana trod with his heel on the head of the Nága, water squirted forth from the folds of the Nága's hood and he was overcome. Ashamed of his defeat, Pannaka complained to Sumana's teacher that the novice had stolen the water. But, on the teacher's advice, Pannaka begged forgiveness of Sumana and promised to fetch water from Anotatta whenever he should need it. Sumana visited him again at the Buddha's instigation, in order that his power might be manifest to others. DhA.iv.129ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On one occasion he came to Benares where the king, pleased with his demeanour, invited him to the palace and persuaded him to live in the royal park. Sixteen years passed, and the king, leaving the city to quell a border rising, left his wife in the care of the ascetic. The next day the ascetic visited the palace, and having seen the queen, fell instantly in love with her, losing all his iddhi powers. When the king returned he found the ascetic disconsolate, and, on learning the reason, agreed to give him the queen. But he secretly asked the queen, whose name was Mudulakkhaná, to think of some device by which she might save the ascetic's holiness. Together the ascetic and the queen left the palace and went to a house which the king had given them and which was generally used as a jakes. The queen made the ascetic clean the house and fetch water and do one hundred other things. The ascetic then realized his folly and hastened back to the king, surrendering the queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a young man of rich family belonging to Sávatthi, who became a monk and practiced meditation. One day, while going for alms, he saw a beautiful woman and was seized with desire. He thereupon gave up his practices, and was brought before the Buddha, who told him this story, at the conclusion of which he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the king and Uppalavanná the queen.

Candádeví, wife of the king of Kási, had, to her great grief, no son. Sakka's throne was heated by her piety, and he persuaded the Bodhisatta, then in Távatimsa, to be born as her son. The Bodhisatta reluctantly agreed. Great were the rejoicings over his birth. He was called Temiya because on the day of his birth there was a great shower throughout the kingdom and he was born wet. When he was one month old, he was brought to the king, and, as he lay in his lap, he heard grievous sentences passed on some robbers brought before the king. Later, as he lay in bed, Temiya recollected his past births and remembered how he had once reigned for twenty years as king of Benares, and, as a result, had suffered in Ussada niraya for twenty thousand years. Anguish seized him at the thought of having to be king once more, but the goddess of his parasol, who had once been his mother, consoled him by advising him to pretend to be dumb and incapable of any action. He took this advice, and for sixteen years the king and queen, in consultation with the ministers and others, tried every conceivable means of breaking his resolve, knowing him to be normal in body. But all their attempts failed, and at last he was put in a chariot and sent with the royal charioteer, Sunanda, to the charnel ground, where he was to be clubbed to death and buried. At the queen's urgent request, however, Temiya was appointed to rule over Kási for one week before being put to death, but the enjoyment of royal power did not weaken his resolve. The charioteer, under the influence of Sakka, took Temiya to what he considered to be the charnel-ground and there, while Sunanda was digging the grave, Temiya stole up behind him and confided to him his purpose and his </data>
<data>resolve to lead the ascetic life. Sunanda was so impressed by Temiya's words that he immediately wished to become an ascetic himself, but Temiya desired him to inform his parents of what had happened. When the king and queen heard Sunanda's news, they went with all their retinue to Temiya's hermitage and there, after hearing Temiya preach, they all became ascetics. The inhabitants of the three kingdoms adjacent to Benares followed their example, and great was the number of ascetics. Sakka and Vissakamma provided shelter for them. The crowds who thus flocked together were called the Múgapakkha samágama. With the death of Malayamahádeva Thera (q.v.) came the end of those who participated in this great collection of ascetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temiya's parents are identified with the parents of the Buddha, Sunanda with Sáriputta and the goddess of the parasol with Uppalavanná. The story was told in reference to the Buddha's Renunciation (J.vi.1-30; the story of Temiya is also given in Temiyacariyá in Cyp.iii.6). It is often referred to (E.g., BuA.51) as giving an example of the Bodhisattva’s great determination. The Dhammika Sutta (q.v.) mentions Múgapakkha in a list of teachers of old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He sent a companion to offer marriage to a young girl of good family and the question was asked whether he had any friends. The answer being in the negative, he was asked to make some. This advice was taken, and he struck up a friendship with the four gate keepers and, through them, with the town warders, astrologers, nobles, commander in chief, viceroy, king, various monks and, finally, the Buddha himself. He therefore came to be known as Mittagandhaka (&quot;man of many friends&quot;). The king showed him great favor and arranged for the celebration of his marriage. He received numerous presents from people in the highest circles, and on the seventh day the young married pair invited the Buddha and five hundred monks to a meal at their house.

Moggallána.&lt;/b&gt; Thera of Ceylon, author of the Abhidhánappadípiká. P.L.C. 187ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Moggallána.&lt;/b&gt; Younger son of Dhátusena. When his brother, Kassapa, took Dhátusena captive, Moggallána fled to Jambudípa. He collected troops, and, in the eighteenth year of Kassapa's reign, landed in Ceylon with twelve friends, counting on the support of the Niganthas. He lived for a time at Kuthárí vihára in Ambatthakola making preparations. Kassapa came out of Síhagiri to meet him, and, being defeated in battle, committed suicide. Moggallána thereupon became king as Moggallána I., making Anurádhapura once more the capital. At first he showed great cruelty to his father's enemies, earning the title of &quot;Rakkhasa,&quot; but later he became gentle and engaged himself in good works. He patronized the Dhammaruci and Ságalika schools and gave them the Dalha  and Dáthakondañña viháras at Síhagiri. To Mahánáma, incumbent of Díghásana (? Díghásanda) vihára he gave the Pabbata-vihára, and the Rájñí nunnery to the Ságalika nuns. In Moggallána's reign, Silákála (Amba Sámanera) brought the Buddha's Hair relic to Ceylon. Moggallána instituted celebrations in its honour and gave them into the charge of Silákála, who left the Order and became his sword bearer (asiggáhaka). Migára and Uttara were two of his generals. He reigned for eighteen years (496 513 A.C.). (Cv.xxxviii.80, 86ff., 96, 108; xxxix.20ff). Moggallána's sister married Upatissa III. Cv.xli.6.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Moggallána.&lt;/b&gt; Eldest son of Ambasámanera Silákála. He was made Ádipáda and put in charge of the Eastern Province. He had two brothers, Dáthápabhuti and Upatissa. On the death of Silákála the former seized the throne and murdered Upatissa. Moggallána marched against him with an army and challenged him to single combat. The challenge was accepted, and the brothers fought, each on an elephant. Dátápabhuti was defeated and killed himself, and Moggallána became king as Moggallána II., also known as Culla Moggallána. He was a great poet and a very good man. He held recitals of the Pitakas and the Commentaries in various parts of the Island and encouraged the study of the Dhamma. He once composed a poem in praise of the Dhamma and recited it while seated on the back of his elephant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By means of damming up the Kadamba River, he constructed three tanks -  Pattapásána, Dhanavápi and Garítara. He ruled for twenty years (537 56), and was succeeded by his son Kittisirimegha. Cv.xli.33f., 43 63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Moggallána.&lt;/b&gt; A general of Aggabodhi II. He revolted against Sanghatissa, and, after some reverses, defeated him, with the help of the treacherous senápati, at Pácínatissapabbata. He then became king as Moggallána III. and was known as Dabba Moggallána (Cv.xliv.63). He did many good deeds, among them being the construction of the Moggallána , Pitthigáma  and Vatagáma viháras. He made Sanghatissa's senápati ruler of Malaya, but later quarrelled with him and had his hands and feet cut off. The senápati's son rose in revolt and killed the king near Síhagiri. Moggallána ruled for six years (511-17 A.C.). Cv.xliv.3-62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Moggallána.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Lokítá and Kassapa. Loka was his brother. Moggallána was known by the title of Mahásámi (see Cv. Trs.i.195, </data>
<data>n. 5) and lived in Rohana. He married Lokitá, daughter of Buddhá, and had four sons: Kitti (afterwards Vijayabáhu I.), Mitta, Mahinda and Rakkhita. Cv.lvii.29f., 41f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Moggallána&lt;/b&gt;. An eminent Thera who was associated with Mahá Kassapa in the Council held at Pulatthipura under the patronage of Parakkamabáhu I. for the purification of the Order. Cv.lxxviii.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Moggallána.&lt;/b&gt; See Sikha Moggallána. Also Ganaka Moggallána and Gopaka Moggallána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha explains to him that suffering arises from various causes -  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;bile, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;phlegm, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;wind, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;bodily humour, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;change of season, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;stress of untoward happenings, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;sudden attacks from without and also from one's kamma    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and to say that these are all predestined is to go too far. Sívaka expresses his approval and declares himself the Buddha's follower (S.iv.230f.; this Sutta is quoted at Mil. 137). Another conversation he had with the Buddha is recorded in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.iii.356). There he asks the Buddha if the claims made with regard to the Dhamma are justified. The Buddha proves to him, by illustration, that they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (SA.iii.87) that the Paribbájaka's name was Sívaka, his sobriquet being due to his having worn his hair in a topknot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mettiyabhummajaká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of monks, followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka forming part of the Chabbaggiyá (q.v.). They lived near Rájagaha. Sp.iii.614; J.ii.387; Sp.iii.579 says they were the chief leaders of the Chabbaggiyá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twice they brought an unfounded charge of breach of morality against &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabba_mallaputta_th')"&gt;Dabba Mallaputta&lt;/a&gt;, who seems to have earned their special dislike. Dabba was in charge of the distribution of alms at the áráma where they stayed, and one day it was their turn to receive alms from a certain householder who had a reputation for providing good food. When, however, the man heard from Dabba that it was the turn of the Mettiyabhummajaká to receive his hospitality, he was much displeased, and ordered his female slave to look after them. The monks were greatly annoyed, and accused Dabba of having slandered them to the householder. They, therefore, persuaded a nun named Mettiyá to go to the Buddha and accuse Dabba of having violated her chastity. The charge was investigated and proved false and the nun expelled from the Order (Vin.ii.76ff.; iii.160ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, these monks persuaded a Licchavi, named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaddha')"&gt;Vaddha&lt;/a&gt;, who was their patron and friend, to go to the Buddha and charge Dabba with having had relations with his wife. This, too, was proved false, and other monks refused to accept alms from Vaddha until he had confessed his guilt (Vin.ii.124ff). One day, while descending from Gijjhakúta, the Mettiyabhummajaká monks saw a heifer with a she goat and the idea occurred to them of calling the heifer Dabba and the she goat Mettiyá and then of spreading the story that they had seen Dabba mating with Mettiyá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vin.iii.166ff.; see also iv. 37f., </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala')"&gt;Dhammapála&lt;/a&gt; mentions a tradition, but contradicts it, that the persecution of Dabba by the Mettiyabhummajaká was so persistent that in the end he committed suicide to escape from it (UdA.431). In any case, they managed to bring him into disfavour with the laity, and the Buddha had to take special steps to reinstate him in their esteem (UdA.434). The incident regarding the charge brought by Mettiyá seems to have given much trouble to later commentators. Sp.iii.582 says that there was a great dispute about this between the monks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavihara')"&gt;Mahávihára&lt;/a&gt; and those of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhayagiri')"&gt;Abhayagiri&lt;/a&gt;.

Metta Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;One should be diligent and upright, gentle and not vain glorious, free from deceit. Let none, out of anger, or through resentment, wish misery to another. A person should cherish boundless goodwill towards all beings, like a mother fostering her only son. SN.vss.143-52; also Khp.p.8f.; where it is called Karaniyametta Sutta, by which name it is more popularly known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta was preached by the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; to five hundred monks who had obtained from him a formula for meditation and dwelt in a region in the Himálaya. The gods there were alarmed by the goodness of the monks and tried to frighten them away. The monks, constantly harassed, sought the Buddha at Sávatthi. He preached this sutta to them and admonished them on the practice of goodwill. They followed his advice, and the gods, understanding, left them in peace (KhpA.232ff.; cp. DhA.i.313ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is included in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paritta')"&gt;Parittas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Metta Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;Once when the Buddha was at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/haliddavasana')"&gt;Haliddavasana&lt;/a&gt;, a discussion arose between some monks and some &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paribbajaka')"&gt;Paribbájakas&lt;/a&gt; as to whether there was any difference between their respective doctrines since they both inculcated the practice of goodwill, compassion, sympathy, and equanimity. The monks consulted the Buddha, who told them that the Paribbájakas were ignorant of how to cultivate these qualities, of what was their goal and their excellence, their fruit and their ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then proceeded to explain to them that these are cultivated through the seven bojjhanga; goodwill has the &quot;beautiful&quot; for its </data>

The Buddha tells him how lure arises from various objects of the senses and how the destruction of this lure means the destruction of dukkha.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mutiyangana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cetiya in Ceylon, erected, according to tradition, by Devánampiyatissa (Codrington, op. cit., 28), on a spot consecrated by the Buddha on his third visit to Ceylon (Sp.i.89). It was restored by Jetthatissa. It is, perhaps, the monastery attached to this cetiya that is mentioned in the Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.1024) as Mutingana. Maliyadeva Thera preached there the Cha Cakka Sutta and sixty monks became arahants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Migára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Migára. &lt;/b&gt;A setthi of Sávatthi. His son, Punnavaddhana, married Visákhá. He was evidently not as rich as Visákhá’s father, Dhanañjaya, for he drove back, on the plea that he could not afford to feed them, the large retinue who wished to follow Visákhá, to her new home. Migára was a follower of the Niganthas, and was angry when Visákhá refused to wait on them and pay homage to them when they visited his house. One day, while Migára was eating and Visákhá was standing by his side fanning him, a monk stopped at their door, and Visákhá stepped aside that Migára might see him. But Migára refused to notice the monk, whom, therefore, Visákhá asked to go away, saying that Migára ate &quot;stale food&quot; (puránam). This greatly annoyed Migára, and he ordered her to be cast out of the house. But the servants refused to carry out his orders, and he was obliged to agree to Visákhá's suggestion that the matter should be submitted for arbitration to the eight householders who had accompanied her to enquire into disputes of such a nature. To them, therefore, Migára recited a list of all his grievances against Visákhá, but she was adjudged quite innocent and threatened to return at once to her father. Migára begged her to stay, and she agreed on condition that he invited the Buddha and his monks for a meal. He did so, but the Niganthas would not allow him to wait upon the Buddha. At the conclusion of the meal, however, out of politeness, he insisted on listening to the Buddha's sermon, if only from behind a screen. At the conclusion of the sermon Migára became a sotápanna, and, realizing the error of his ways, adopted Visákhá as his mother by sucking her breast. Henceforth Visákhá was called Migáramátá. The next day, again, the Buddha was invited, and </data>
<data>Migára's wife became a sotápanna. From that day onwards they kept open house for the Buddha and his monks. As a token of his gratitude, Migára held a great festival in honour of Visákhá, to which the Buddha and his monks were invited. She was bathed in sixteen pots of perfumed water and presented with a jeweled ornament called Ghanamatthakapasádhana (DhA.i.387ff.; AA.i.220; MA.i.471f). It is probably this same Migára whose grandson was called Sálha (q.v.) Migáranattá; but see Migára (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Migára. &lt;/b&gt;Son of Visákhá and Punnavaddhana. DhA.i.407; AA.i.313 says he was their eldest son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Migára Rohaneyya. &lt;/b&gt;A very rich setthi of Sávatthi. Ugga, Pasenadi's minister, mentions him during a visit to the Buddha and remarks on his immense wealth. But the Buddha reminds him that Migára's treasure is not real treasure in that it is subject to various dangers   fire, water, kings, robbers, enemies and heirs. A.iv.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says (AA.ii.697) that Migára was called Rohaneyya because he was the grandson of Rohanasetthi. He is probably to be distinguished from Visákhá's son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Migára. &lt;/b&gt;A general of Kassapa I. He built a parivena called after himself and a house for an image of Abhiseka Buddha, for which he also instituted a festival. Cv.xxxix.6, 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mogharája Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family and studied under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari')"&gt;Bávarí&lt;/a&gt; as an ascetic. He was one of the sixteen pupils sent by Bávarí to the Buddha. When Mogharája had asked his question of the Buddha and had received the answer, he attained arahantship. He then attained distinction by wearing rough cloth which had been thrown away by caravaners, tailors, and dyers, and the Buddha declared him foremost among wearers of rough clothing (See also A.i.25). Later, through want of care and former kamma, pimples and the like broke out over his body. Judging that his lodging was infected, he spread a couch of straw in the Magadha field and lived there even during the winter. When the Buddha asked him how he fared in the cold, he replied that he was extremely happy (Thag.207f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Mogharája first resolved to win the eminence which was his. In the time of Atthadassí Buddha he was a brahmin teacher, and one day, while teaching his students, he saw the Buddha, and having worshipped him with great solemnity, he uttered six verses in his praise and offered him a gift of honey. Later, after sojourn in the deva worlds, he became a minister of King Katthaváhana, and was sent by him, with one thousand others, to visit Kassapa Buddha. He heard the Buddha preach, entered the order, and lived the life of a monk for twenty thousand years (ThagA.i.181ff.; SN. vs. 1006). The Samyutta Nikáya contains a stanza spoken by Mogharája and the Buddha's answer thereto (S.i.23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (SA.i.49f) that Mogharája was present during the discussion of Pasuraparibbájaka (q.v.) with Sáriputta. At the end of Sáriputta's explanation, Mogharája wished to settle the matter and uttered this </data>
<data>stanza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mogharája is given as an example of one who attained arahantship by the development of investigation (vimámsam dhuram katvá) (SA.iii.201).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána contains two sets of verses in reference to Mogharája. They seem to be parts of the same Apadána which have become separated. The first set (Ap.i.87f ) gives an account of the meeting of Mogharája with Atthadassí Buddha (see above) and includes the verses uttered by Mogharája in praise of the Buddha. The second set (Ap.ii.486f) contains an account of his meeting with Padumuttara Buddha and the resolves he made before him. It further mentions that, for one thousand years, in a later birth, Mogharája suffered in hell, and that for five hundred births he suffered from skin diseases. This was because he had lighted a fire in the Buddha's cloister and had made the floor black. In his last birth, too, he suffered from a kuttharoga and could not sleep at night, hence his name (mogharajjasukham yasmá Mogharájá tato aham). These verses also include the Mogharájamánava pucchá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Milinda-Pañha (p. 412) appears a stanza attributed to Mogharája, but not found in the stanzas mentioned in connection with him either in the Sutta Nipáta or in the Theragáthá. See also&lt;a href="mogharaja-manava')"&gt;Moghará&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="mogharaja-manava')"&gt;-jamánava-pucchá&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mejjha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A king and his country. The sixteen thousand brahmins who had enjoyed the patronage of Mandavya (q.v.), after they had lost caste through having eaten the leavings of Mátanga, went to live in Meghiyarattha, and Mátanga himself proceeded thither that he might humble their pride. The brahmins saw him and reported to the king that Mátanga was a juggler and a mountebank. The king, therefore, sent messengers to seize him. They found him sitting on a bench eating, and, approaching him from behind, struck him dead with their swords. The gods were enraged, and pouring down hot ashes on the kingdom utterly destroyed it (J.iv.388f; MA.ii.613ff). The country became a wilderness known as Mejjhárañña (E.g., M.i.378; J.v.114, 267; Mil.130).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scene of the Vighása Játaka is said to have been in Mejjhárañña (J.iii.310). The wilderness was also known as Mátangárañña, being connected with Mátanga. MA.ii.615.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The ram was beaten by the elephant keepers because he took the grass from the stalls, while the dog had suffered at the hands of the cook for stealing meat from the kitchen. They met and agreed that the dog should go to the stalls and the ram to the kitchen, in order to avoid suspicion. The king saw this and set the question to his ministers. Only Mahosadha knew the solution and he told it to the others. The king was pleased and gave to each a chariot, a she mule and various other gifts. J.vi.349ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Múlapariyáya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first sutta of the Majjhima Nikáya. It was preached in the Subhagavana in Ukkatthá, and is claimed as striking the keynote of the entire doctrine of the Buddha (sabbadhamma-múlapariyáya). In the sutta the Buddha explains various contemporary systems of philosophy and points out the differences between these and his own system. It also deals with the theory of the soul and of Nibbána (M.i.1-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Commentary* states that the five hundred monks to   whom the sutta was addressed found no pleasure in listening to it. The Buddha,   realizing this, preached to them the Múlapariyáya Játaka** (q.v.). Their pride   was thereby vanquished, and they begged the Buddha for a subject of   meditation. Later, when the Buddha was away journeying, staying at the   Gotamaka cetiya in Vesáli, he preached to them the Gotamaka Sutta and they   became arahants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* MA.ii.46ff.; see also AA.i.457 and J.ii.269, where it   is stated that at the end of the Gotamaka Sutta the earth trembled.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;** But in the introduction to the Játaka itself, it is   stated that the Játaka was related, not to them, but in reference to them,   after they had become Arahants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

For his story see the Losaka Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mittavindaka. &lt;/b&gt;The son of a very rich merchant of Benares in the days of Kassapa Buddha. His parents were sotápannas, but he himself was an unbeliever. When his father died, Mittavindaka stopped all alms. His mother bribed him one full moon day to keep the fast by promising him one thousand. He agreed to do this, and went to the monastery where he slept all night, and then, on his return to the house, refused to eat until he was given the money. Later, he wished to go on a trading voyage, and, when his mother tried to restrain him, he knocked her down. In mid ocean the ship refused to move, and when lots were cast, the lot fell three times on Mittavindaka. He was, therefore, fastened to a raft and cast adrift. The raft was cast up on an island where lived four female spirits of the dead. They passed seven days in bliss and then seven in woe. He lived with them for the seven days of bliss, and when they departed to do their penance, he left them and came to several islands, one after the other, each one greater than the last in prosperity and in its number of women. He then went on the Ussada niraya, which appeared to him as a most beautiful city. There he saw a man supporting on his head a wheel as sharp as a razor, but to Mittavindaka it appeared as a lotus bloom. He asked the man for it, and insisted on getting it in spite of the man's warning. No sooner had he taken the wheel on his head than he started suffering the torments of hell. At that time the Bodhisatta, born as a deva, was going round Ussada with his retinue. He saw Mittavindaka, who asked him the reason for his torture, and the </data>
<data>Bodhisatta told him that it was the result of his greed and his wickedness to his mother. There would be no salvation for him till his sins were expiated. J.iv.1ff.; see also Losaka and the three Mittavinda Játakas (Nos. 82, 104, 369); cp. VibhA.471; Avadánas iii.6 (36) and Dvy.603f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is given in the Catudvára Rtaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mittavindaka is an example of a person who behaved wrongly towards his mother.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mora Játaka (No. 159)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as a golden peacock and lived on a golden hill in Dandaka. He used to recite one spell in honour of the sun and another in praise of the Buddhas, and thus he was protected from all harm. Khemá, queen of Benares, saw in a dream a golden peacock preaching. She longed for the dream to come true and told it to the king. He made enquiries, and sent hunters to catch the golden peacock, but they failed. Khemá died of grief, and the king, in his anger, inscribed on a golden plate that anyone eating the flesh of the golden peacock would be immortal. His successors, seeing the inscription, sent out hunters, but they, too, failed to catch the Bodhisatta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six kings in succession failed in this quest. The seventh engaged a hunter who, having watched the Bodhisatta, trained a peahen to cry at the snap of his finger. The hunter laid his snare, went with the peahen and made her cry. Instantly, the golden peacock forgot his spell and was caught in the snare. When he was led before the king and told the reason for his capture, he agreed with the king that his golden colour was owing to good deeds done in the past as king of that very city, and that he was a peacock owing to some sin he had committed. The eating of his flesh could not make anyone young or immortal, seeing that he himself was not immortal. Being asked to prove his words, he had the lake near the city dredged, when the golden chariot in which he used to ride was discovered. The king thereupon paid him great honour and led him back to Dandaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a backsliding monk who was upset by the sight of a woman magnificently attired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with the king of Benares (J.ii.33 8; the story is alluded to at J.iv.414).

At their meeting they begged each other's forgiveness, and, with the king's help, Meghavannábhaya restored the Mahávihára (Mhv.xxxvii.17ff). According to the Smantapásádiká (Sp.i.102; also SadS.43), one of the parivenas built by Meghavannábhaya seems to have borne his name.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Migáramátupásáda&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to the monastery erected by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa')"&gt;Visákhá&lt;/a&gt; Migáramátá in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pubbarama')"&gt;Pubbáráma&lt;/a&gt;, to the east of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;. It is said (DhA.i.410ff.; SNA.ii.502; UdA.158; DA.iii.860; SA.i.116, etc.) that, one day, when Visákhá had gone to the monastery to hear the Dhamma and afterwards attend on the sick monks and novices, she left in the preaching hall her &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahalata_pasadhana')"&gt;Mahálatápasádhana&lt;/a&gt; and her servant girl forgot to remove it (this incident is referred to at Vin.iv.161f., as the cause of the institution of a Vinaya rule).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, on going to fetch it, she found that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; had put it away, and Visákhá, being told of this, decided not to wear it again. She had it valued by goldsmiths, who declared that it was worth nine crores and one hundred thousand. She had the ornament put in a cart and sent round for sale. But there was none in Sávatthi rich enough to buy it, and Visákhá herself bought it back. With the money thus obtained she built the Migáramátupásáda at the Buddha's suggestion. The site for the pásáda on the Pubbáráma cost nine crores, the buildings costing another nine. While the building was being erected, the Buddha went on one of his journeys and, at Visákhá's request; &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; was left to supervise the work with five hundred other monks. Moggallána made use of his iddhi powers in order to expedite and facilitate the work. The building had two floors with five hundred rooms in each, the whole structure being surmounted by a pinnacle of solid gold, capable of holding sixty water pots. The work was </data>
<data>completed in nine months, and the celebration of its dedication was held on the Buddha's return. These celebrations lasted for four months and cost a further nine crores. On the last day, Visákhá gave gifts of cloth to the monks, each novice receiving robes worth one thousand. The building was so richly equipped that one of Visákhá's friends, wishing to spread a small carpet, worth one hundred thousand, wandered all over the building, but could find no place of which it was worthy. Ananda found her weeping in disappointment, and suggested that it should be spread between the foot of the stairs and the spot where the monks washed their feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the last twenty years of his life, when the Buddha was living at Sávatthi, he divided his time between the Anáthapíndikáráma at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; and the Migáramátupásáda, spending the day in one place and the night in the other and vice versa (SNA.i.336).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, therefore, to be expected that numerous suttas were preached there; chief among these were the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/agganna_sutta')"&gt;Aggañña&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/utthaana_s')"&gt;Utthána&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/ariyapariyesanaa_sutta')"&gt;Ariyapariyesana&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasadakampana')"&gt;Pásádakampana&lt;/a&gt;. See also S.i.77, 190 (= Ud.vi.2); iii.100; v. 216, 222f.; A.i.193f.; ii.183f.; iii.344f.; (cp Thag.vss.689 704); iv. 204f., 255, 265, 269; Ud.ii.9; DhA.iv.142f.; iv.176.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at Migáramátupásáda that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vighaasa_jat_393')"&gt;Vighása Játaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached, and the Buddha gave permission for the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patimokkha')"&gt;Pátimokkha&lt;/a&gt; to be recited in his absence.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Medatalumpa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Sákyan village three leagues from Nangaraka (M.ii.119). Pasenadi when staying there with Dígha Káráyana, heard that the Buddha was there and visited him. On this occasion was preached the Dhammacetiya Sutta (q.v.). This was the last time that Pasenadi saw the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary, however, in its record (DhA.i.356) of the king's visit, calls the place Ulumpa. On the other hand, the Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.753) confirms the reading Medatalumpa, and says that it was so called because medavanna stones were visible there on the surface of the earth (medavanná pásáná kir'ettha ussanná ahesum, tasmá Medatalumpan ti sankham gatam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Migálopa used to fly much higher than the others in spite of his father's warning, and he was, one day, dashed to pieces by the Verambha winds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to an unruly monk who is identified with Migálopa. J.iii.255f.; cp. Gijjha Játaka (No. 427).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was born in the family of a burgher of Sáketa and was so called because his head resembled that of a ram. When the Buddha was staying in Añjanavana in Sáketa, Mendasira heard him preach and entered the Order, attaining arahantship in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha, he lived near Mount Gotama in Himavá with a large following of ascetics. There they met the Buddha and offered him lotus flowers. Fifty one kappas ago he was a king named Januttama (Jaluttama) (Thag.78; ThagA.i.171f). He is evidently to be identified with Padumapújaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.102f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Mitacintí (the Bodhisatta) saw the danger and warned the others, but they would not listen and were caught in a net. Then Mitacintí splashed about and deceived the fishermen into thinking that the other two had escaped. They thereupon raised the net by one single corner and the other two escaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to two aged monks who spent the rainy season in the forest, wishing to go to the Buddha. But they constantly postponed their visit and it was not till three months after the end of the rains that they finally arrived at Jetavana. The two monks are identified with the thoughtless fish. J.i.426-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When Mahájanaka renounced the world he was followed by a great crowd, and there was danger that he might be turned from his noble purpose. Mígájina, who had just risen from an ecstatic trance, saw this and, appearing before him, exhorted him to be earnest and determined. (J.vi.58ff) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migájina is identified with Moggallána. J.vi.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mudupáni Játaka (No. 262)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares and had a daughter whom he was anxious to marry to his nephew; later, however, he changed his mind. But the young people loved each other, and the prince bribed the princess's nurse to help her to escape. The nurse, while combing the girl's hair, indicated, by scratching her head with the comb that the prince was in love with her. The princess then taught her a stanza to be repeated to the prince: &quot;A soft hand, a well trained elephant and a black rain cloud will give you what you want.&quot; The prince understood, and, one night in the dark fortnight, when his preparations were complete, a heavy shower of rain fell as he waited outside the princess's window, accompanied by a page boy seated on the king's elephant. The princess slept in the same room as the king, and realizing that the prince was there, she told the king that she wished to bathe in the rain. The king led her to the window and bade her step outside on to the balcony while he held her hand. As she bathed she held out the other hand to the prince, who removed the bangles from it and placed them on the page's arm. Then, lifting the boy, he placed him beside her. The princess took his hand and placed it in her father's, who thereupon let go of her other arm. This process was repeated, and, in the darkness, the king took the page inside thinking it was his daughter and put him to sleep while the lovers escaped. When the king discovered the plot, he was convinced of the futility of trying to guard women and forgave the lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a monk who became a backslider owing to a woman's wiles. The monk became a sotápanna. J.ii.323 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Migalandika&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An undesirable monk (samanakuttaka). When the Buddha had once been preaching to the monks in Mahávana in Vesáli regarding the defilement and filth of the body, and had retired into solitude, many of the monks, in disgust with their bodies, put an end to their lives. Some of them sought out Migalandika and asked him to cut off their heads. This he did with a sword, but on his way to the River Vaggamudá, to wash his sword, he was seized with remorse. A Márakáyika devatá, however, appeared before him in the river and assured him he was doing a service to the monks by helping them to commit suicide. This encouraged him, and he put to death many more monks, until the Buddha, discovering the facts, intervened. v.l. Migaladdhika. Vin.iii.68ff.; Sp.ii.399ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha answers that he who is enamored of objects of sense is a sadutiyavihári, while the lone dweller is he who has cast off craving. S.iv.35f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Moravápi&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tank in Ceylon, built by Mahásena and repaired by Parakkamabáhu I. (Mhv.xxxvii.47. MT.680; Cv.lxviii.44). The district round it was called by the same name (Cv.lxix.8). In Parakkamabáhu's campaign against Gajabáhu, the officers in charge of the district were Nílagallaka (Cv.lxx.67) and, later, the Nagaragiri Mahinda. Cv.lxx.200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place seems to have had some strategic importance (e.g., Cv.lxii.177, 201) and to have been situated to the south of Anurádhapura and the west of Kálavápi (Cv.Trs.i.336, n.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moravápi was the residence of the Elder Mahádatta, who was called Moravápivásí.

The Bodhisatta was once the leader of a band of ascetics, and one of these, disregarding the advice of the Bodhisatta, adopted a young elephant whose dam was dead. The elephant grew up and slew its master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who took a piece of cloth belonging to his teacher and made with it a shoe bag, feeling sure that his teacher would not mind. The latter, however, flew into a rage and struck him. J.ii.130ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mittámitta Játaka &lt;/b&gt;(No. 473). The Bodhisatta was once the minister of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. At that time the other ministers were slandering a certain courtier who was upright. The king consulted the Bodhisatta, who pointed out to him the marks of a friend as opposed to those of a foe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to the king of Kosala, who consulted the Buddha on a similar matter.

The Buddha spent there the third week after the Enlightenment. There was a great shower of rain, and the Nága king, Mucalinda, of the tree, sheltered the Buddha by winding his coils seven times round the Buddha's body and holding his hood over the Buddha's head (Vin.i.3; J.i.80; BuA.8, 241; Ud.ii.1; Mtn.iii.300, 302; DhSA.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Udána Commentary (100f.; see also MA.i.385) adds that the space provided by the Nága's coils was as large as the floor space of the Lohapásáda and that the Nága king lived in a pond near the tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mucalinda. &lt;/b&gt;A king of long ago. He is mentioned (J.vi.99) in a list of those who, in spite of having given great gifts, could not penetrate beyond the realms of sense. He is, perhaps, identical with Mucalinda (1), and probably also with Mujalinda (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mucalinda.&lt;/b&gt; A lake in Himavá, north of Nálicapabbata. Vessantara and his family passed it on their way to Vankagiri, which was near by (J.vi.518, 519, there is a description of it at J.vi.534 and again at 539).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems also to have been called Sumucalinda (E.g., J.vi.582). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucalinda is one of the great lakes of Himavá.

The Udumbariká Síhanáda, the Mahá Sakuladáyi and the Culla Sakúladáyi Suttas were preached there (D.iii.36ff.; M.ii.1, 29).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place was so called because peacocks were protected there and food was provided for them (DA.iii.835; MA.ii.694).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moranivápa was on the bank of the Sumágadhá and the Buddha is mentioned (D.iii.39) as walking there.

A story is told of a monk (according to some MSS., his name was Revata) who lived in the vihára near by (MA.i.536). He was an Arahant, and was one day invited to a meal at the house of one of the king's ministers. At the end of the meal the minister's daughter sat near him talking to him. Another monk, seeing them, thought they were on the same seat, and when the Elder returned to the vihára, the monk showed his displeasure in various ways. Realizing the reason of the monk's strange behaviour, the Elder convinced him that, as an Arahant, he was incapable of such conduct as was attributed to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Moggaliputta Tissa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;President of the Third Council. In his penultimate birth he was a Brahmá, called Tissa, and consented to be born in the world of men at the urgent request of the arahants who held the Second Council, in order to prevent the downfall of the Buddha's religion. He was born in the home of the brahmin Moggali of Pátaliputta. Siggava and Candavajji had been entrusted with the task of converting him. From the time of Tissa's birth, therefore, for seven years, Siggava went daily to the house of Moggali, but not even one word of welcome did he receive. In the eighth year someone said to him, &quot;Go further on.&quot; As he went out he met Moggali, and, on being asked whether he had received anything at his house, he said he had. Moggali inquired at home and the next day charged Siggava with lying. But hearing Siggava's explanation, he was greatly pleased and thereafter constantly offered Siggava hospitality at his house. One day, young Tissa, who was thoroughly proficient in the Vedas, was much annoyed at finding Siggava occupying his seat and spoke to him harshly. But Siggava started to talk to him and asked him a question from the Cittayamaka. Tissa could not answer it, and, in order to learn the Buddha's teachings, he entered the Order under Siggava, becoming a sotápanna soon after. Siggava instructed him in the Vinaya and Candavajji in the Sutta and Abhidhamma Pitakas. In due course he attained arahantship and became the acknowledged leader of the monks at Pátaliputta (Mhv.v.95ff., 131ff.; Dpv.v.55ff.; Sp.i.35 41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the festival of dedication of the Asokáráma and the other viháras built by Asoka, Moggaliputta Tissa informed Asoka, in answer to a question, that one becomes a kinsman of the Buddha's religion only by letting one's son or daughter enter the Order. Acting on this suggestion, Asoka had both </data>
<data>his children ordained. Moggaliputta acted as Mahinda's upajjháya (Mhv.v.191ff.; Sp.i.50f). Later, because of the great gains which accrued to the monks through Asoka's patronage of the Buddha's religion, the Order became corrupt, and Moggaliputta committed the monks to the charge of Mahinda, and, for seven years, lived in solitary retreat on the Ahogangá pabbata. From there Asoka sent for him to solve his doubts as to what measure of sin belonged to him owing to the murder of the monks by his minister. But Moggaliputta would not come until persuaded that his services were needed to befriend the religion. He traveled by boat to Pátaliputta, and was met at the landing place by the king who helped him out by supporting him on his arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Sp.i.58, the king had a dream on the preceding night which the soothsayers interpreted to mean that a great ascetic (samananága) would touch his right hand. As the Thera touched the king's hand the attendants were about to kill him, for to do this was a crime punishable by death. The king, however, restrained them. The Thera took the king's hand as a sign that he accepted him as pupil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king, having led him to Rativaddhana Park, begged him to perform a miracle. This the Thera consented to do and made the earth quake in a single region. To convince the king that the murder of the monks involved no guilt for himself, the Thera preached to him the Tittira Játaka. Within a week, with the aid of two yakkhas, the king had all the monks gathered together and held an assembly at the Asokáráma. In the presence of Moggaliputta, Asoka questioned the monks on their various doctrines, and all those holding heretical views were expelled from the Order, Moggaliputta decreeing that the Vibhajjaváda alone contained the teaching of the Buddha. Later, in association with one thousand arahants, Moggaliputta held the Third Council at Asokáráma, with </data>
<data>himself as President, and compiled the Kathávatthuppakarana, in refutation of false views. This was in the seventeenth year of Asoka's reign and Moggaliputta was seventy two years old (Mhv.v.231 81; Dpv.vii.16ff., 39ff.; Sp.i.57ff). At the conclusion of the Council in nine months, Moggaliputta made arrangements, in the month of Kattika, for monks to go to the countries adjacent to India for the propagation of the religion (For a list of these, see Mhv.xii.1ff.; Dpv.viii.1ff.; Sp.i.63ff). Later, when the request came from Ceylon for a branch of the Bodhi tree, Asoka consulted the Elder as to how this could be carried out, and Moggaliputta told him of the five resolves made by the Buddha on his death bed (Mhv.xviii.21ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dípavamsa says (Dpv. 68ff., 82, 94, 96, 100f. 107f.; also vii.23ff ) that Moggaliputta Tissa's ordination was in the second year of Candagutta's reign, when Siggava was sixty four years old. Candagutta reigned for twenty four years, and was followed by Bindusára, who reigned for thirty seven years, and he was succeeded by Asoka. In the sixth year of Asoka's reign, Moggaliputta was sixty-six years old, and it was then that he ordained Mahinda. He was eighty years old at the time of his death and had been leader of the Order for sixty eight years. He died in the twenty sixth year of Asoka's reign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Migasira Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a brahmin family of Kosala, and was so called because he was born under the constellation of Migasira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acquired brahmin culture and practiced the skull spell (chavasísamanta), by which he could tap with his nail on the skull and declare the destiny of the dead person. Later, he became a Paribbájaká and visited the Buddha at Sávatthi. The Buddha, having been told of his claims to knowledge, gave to him the skull of an arahant. Migasira tried his art, but had to confess himself beaten. The Buddha thereupon offered to teach him if he would join the Order. Migasira agreed and soon became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a brahmin, and, seeing the Buddha, offered him eight handfuls of kusa grass (? kusattha) (Thag.vss.181&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;f.; ThagA.i.305ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Kusatthakadáyaka Thera of the Apadána. v.l.

Padumuttara Buddha preached his first sermon to his cousins, Devala and Sujáta, in the park of Mithilá, (Bu.xi.23; BuA.159) and later to King Ananda and his retinue in the same spot (BuA.160).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mithilá is generally identified with Janakapura, a small town within the Nepal border, north of which the Mazaffarpur and Darbhanga districts meet (CAGI., p. 718).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Indian Epics (E.g., Ramayana i. 48) Mithilá, is chiefly famous as the residence of King Janaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was the son of Pandukábhaya and Suvannapálí, and reigned for sixty years (307&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-247 B.C.). Among his works was the laying out of the Mahámeghavana. He had ten sons and two daughters, and was succeeded by his second son, Devánampiyatissa (Mhv.xi.1ff.; xiii.2). For their names see Dpv.xi.5 and xvii.25f., also MT. 425: Abhaya, Tissa (Devánampiyatissa), Nága (Mahánága), Uttiya, Mattábhayá, Mitta, Síva (Mahá-Síva), Asela, Tissa, (Súratissa), Kíra, Anulá and Sívalí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dípavamsa (v. 82; but see xi.13) says that the sixth year of Asoka's reign corresponded with the forty eighth of Mutasíva's. Mutasíva, was crowned in the fourteenth year of Candagutta's reign and was still alive when the Third Council was held, when Mahinda was entrusted with the conversion of Ceylon; but Mahinda waited for the death of Mutasíva before carrying out his mission.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Moriyá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A khattiya clan of India. Among those claiming a share of the Buddha's relics were the Moriyas of Pipphalivana. They came rather late and had to be satisfied with a share of the ashes (D.ii.166; Bu.xxviii.4). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candagutta, grandfather of Asoka, was also a Moriyan (Mhv.v.16; Dpv.vi.19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávamsa Tíká (MT. 180) contains an account of the origin of the name. According to one theory they were so called because they rejoiced in the prosperity of their city (attánam nagarasiriyá modápíti, ettha sañjátá ti, dakárassa rakáram katvá Moriyá ti laddhavohárá). They lived in a delightful land. Another theory connects the name with mora (peacock). The city which they founded had buildings of blue stone, like the neck of the peacock, and the place always resounded with the cries of peacocks. It is said that the Moriyans were originally Sákyan princes of Kapilavatthu, who escaped to the Himálaya regions to save themselves from the attacks of Vidúdabha, and established a city there. Thus Asoka was a kinsman of the Buddha, for Candagutta was the son of the chief queen of the Moriyan king. The king was killed by a neighbouring ruler and the city pillaged. MT.183; but according to the Mudráráksasa (Act iii.) Candragupta, was a Vrsala, a person of low birth, an illegitimate son of the last Nanda, king by a Súdra woman, Murá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asoka's mother, Dhammá, was also a Moriyan princess (MT.189). Mention is also made of the Moriyans as a Singhalese clan (Cv.xxxviii.13; xli.69; see also Cv.Trs.i.29, n. 2). Whether these had any connection with the Moriyans of India is not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Mendaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very rich householder of Bhaddiyanagara in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga')"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt;. He was the father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhananjaya')"&gt;Dhanañjaya&lt;/a&gt; and, therefore, the grandfather of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa')"&gt;Visákhá&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the five Treasurers of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt;. When the Buddha visited&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya')"&gt;Bhaddiya&lt;/a&gt;, Mendaka, with the help of Visákhá, entertained him and the monks, and, after listening to the Buddha, he became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. DhA.i.384ff.; he had been earlier a follower of the heretics. The heretics tried in vain to stop him from visiting the Buddha; AA.i.219f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Vin.i.240f.; also PSA.509; DhA.iii.372f.; Vsm.383; the accounts differ slightly ) that when he went to his granaries after his ceremonial bath, as he stood at the door, showers of grain would fall from heaven and fill the stores. His wife, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candapadumaa')"&gt;Candapadumá&lt;/a&gt;, would cook one measure of rice and one curry and serve the food, ladle in hand. As long as there were people coming to receive the food, so long would the food cooked be un-exhausted. Mendaka's son, Dhanañjaya, would put one thousand pieces into a purse and give money from this purse to all who needed it, and at the end of the day the purse would remain full. His daughter in law, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumanadevi')"&gt;Sumanadeví&lt;/a&gt;, would sit by a basket containing four donas of seed paddy and distribute from this supply among the servants, enough to last for six months, but the supply of paddy would remain unexhausted. Mendaka's slave, Punnaka, ploughed his fields with a golden plough. With every furrow so ploughed, six other furrows would appear, three on either </data>
<data>side, each one ammana wide. These five people came to be known as the five very lucky ones (Pañcamahápuññá). When Bimbisára heard of this, he sent his minister to Bhaddiya with a fourfold army and discovered that it was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha left Bhaddiya for Anguttarápa, Mendaka gave orders to his servants and followed the Buddha with abundant provisions of all sorts, entertaining the Buddha and his monks with luxurious food and fresh milk. At the end of the meal, Mendaka provided the monks with ghee and butter for their journey. At first the monks were unwilling to accept the gifts, but the Buddha, at Mendaka's request, allowed them to do so (Viii.i.243ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendaka was so called (&quot;Ram&quot;) because, behind his house, in a yard eight karísas in extent, some golden rams pranced up and down, as big as elephants, horses or bulls, hoofing the earth, smiting each other back to back. Whenever Mendaka needed food or garments or money, he would place balls of colored thread in the mouths of the rams, and when he pulled these out, there would follow them all that he needed (PSA.504; BuA.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this was because of good deeds done in the past by Mendaka. In the time of Vipassí Buddha, he was a householder named Avaroja. He had an uncle of the same name, and when the latter proposed building a Gandhakuti for the Buddha, his nephew wished to help with it. But the uncle refused his help. He therefore built an Elephant Hall (kuñjarasálá) opposite the Gandhakuti. In the middle of the hall was a jeweled pavilion with a seat for preaching, which contained a foot rest, all this supported by golden rams. At the festival of dedication, he gave alms for four mouths to sixty eight hundred thousand monks and presented them with sets of three robes each, the robes given to the novices being worth one hundred thousand. After many births, he was born </data>
<data>in this age as setthi of Benares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, when on his way to the palace, he met the purohita, who told him that there would be a famine in three months. Profiting by this warning, the Treasurer exerted himself to collect all possible grain and store it in every available place. The famine came, and for many months the Treasurer and his retinue lived on the stored grain, but, in the end, the supplies were exhausted, and most of them, acting on his advice, went to the mountains in search of food. He, his wife, his son and daughter in law and a slave remained behind. One day, his wife cooked a náli of rice which she had hidden away and divided it into five portions. As the family were about to eat, a Pacceka Buddha came to the door for alms; they all gave him their portions of food and made various wishes. As a result of these earnest wishes, Mendaka and the members of his family and his slave possessed the supernatural powers above mentioned. During the afternoon, after the Pacceka Buddha had had the food, the Treasurer felt very hungry and asked his wife if there were any lumps of rice sticking to the bottom of the pot. She went into the kitchen to the pot and found it full of fragrant food. From that time their supply of food never failed. DhA.iii.363ff.; but according to DhA.iv.203, Mendaka's name in the time of Vipassí Buddha was Aparájita. He was a nephew of that Aparájita who, in this life, became Jotiya sethi. (See also Divyávadána, pp.123ff., 131ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendaka's grandson was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uggaha_menda')"&gt;Uggaha&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Their pride was quelled, and from that time they honored their teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to some monks: to whom the Múla-pariyáya Sutta was preached.

He has overcome all obstacles and knows all things. He is as different from a householder as a peacock from a fast flying swan. According to the Commentary (SNA.i.254 t ) the sutta is a composite one made up of stanzas preached on various occasions; thus, the first four verses had reference to a mother and a son who joined the Order, met frequently, and, owing to their affection for each other, fell into sin (Cp. Mátuputtika Sutta). The fifth was in reference to Upaka's attainment of anágámiphala; the sixth to Khadiravaniya Revata; the seventh was preached to Suddhodana to explain why the Buddha had renounced his luxuries. The ninth was in reference to Ciñcá's attempt to malign the Buddha; the tenth was preached to the daughter of a Sávatthi setthi. Seeing a weaver's spindle and reflecting on it, she realized the crookedness of beings and was disgusted with the worldly life. The Buddha, reading her thoughts, appeared before her in a ray of light and preached to her. The eleventh was preached to the seven year old daughter of a weaver of Alavi, who became a sotápanna and died soon after (See DhA.iii.170ff). The twelfth was preached to the brahmin Pañcaggadáyaka; and the thirteenth was in reference to a treasurer of Sávatthi who joined the Order and left it three times, on the fourth time of joining he became an arahant. The fourteenth was in reference to the Buddha's cousin Nanda, who was being teased by the monks even after he had attained arahantship. The last was in defence of a monk for whom a hunter conceived a friendship, providing him with alms; the monk was a forest dweller, </data>

This was reported to the Buddha, who sent for him and preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kakacuupama_s')"&gt;Kakacúpama Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.122ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.ii.12f) is recorded a discussion between Moliya Phagguna and the Buddha, regarding the consciousness sustenance (viññánáhára). Moliya asks a question as to who feeds on consciousness. The Buddha rejects the question as being wrongly put and similar questions follow, which the Buddha puts in a different form and to which he provides the answers. In another context (S.ii.50), in the same collection, Kalárakhattiya is reported as saying to Sáriputta that Moliya Phagguna had reverted to the lay life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; (SA.ii.22; MA.i.315) explains that the man's name was Phagguna and that he was given the title of Moli because he wore a large knot of hair on the top of his head while he was a layman, and that the name persisted after he joined the Order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/phagguna')"&gt;Phagguna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once, when the Buddha was staying with him at Cáliká (this was in the thirteenth year after the Enlightenment, BuA.3), Meghiya went to Jantugáma for alms, and, on his return, was much attracted by a mango grove on the banks of the river Kimikálá. He asked the Buddha's permission to dwell there in meditation. Twice the Buddha refused, but, on his third request, let him go. There, however, Meghiya was consumed by evil thoughts and returned to the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him on the five things which make the heart ripe for emancipation   good friends, virtuous life, profitable talks, zealous exertion, insight   and admonished him. Meghiya thereupon attained arahantship. A.iv.354ff.; Ud.iv.1; Thag.66; AA.ii.794; DhA.i.289 says, however, that at the end of the Buddha's sermon Meghiya became a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety one kappas ago, on the death of Vipassí Buddha, there was a great earthquake. The people were very frightened, but Vessavana explained to them the reason for it and dispelled their fears. Meghiya was then a householder, and having thus heard of the Buddha's qualities, was filled with joy. Fourteen kappas ago he was a king named Samita (UdA.217ff.; ThagA.i.149f). He is evidently to be identified with Buddhasaññaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.151f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meghiya Vagga&lt;/b&gt;.

<data>&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;1. Metteyya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future Buddha, the fifth of this kappa (Bu.xxvii.21).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavattisihanaada_s')"&gt;Cakkavatti Síhanáda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, he will be born, when human beings will live to an age of eighty thousand years, in the city of Ketumatí (present Benares), whose king will be the Cakkavattí Sankha. Sankha will live in the fairy palace where once dwelt King Mahápanadá, but later he will give the palace away and will himself become a follower of Metteyya Buddha (D.iii.75ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anágatavamsa (J.P.T.S.1886, pp.42, 46ff., 52; DhSA.415 gives the names of his parents) gives further particulars. Metteyya will be born in a very eminent brahmin family and his personal name will be Ajita. Metteyya is evidently the name of his gotta. For eight thousand years he will live the household life in four palaces   Sirivaddha, Vaddhamána, Siddhattha and Candaka -  his chief wife being Candamukhí and his son Brahmavaddhana. Having seen the four signs while on his way to the park, he will be dissatisfied with household life and will spend one week in practicing austerities. Then he will leave home, travelling in his palace and accompanied by a fourfold army, at the head of which will be eighty-four thousand brahmins and eighty four thousand Khattiya maidens. Among his followers will be Isidatta and Púrana, two brothers, Játimitta, Vijaya, Suddhika and Suddhaná, Sangha and Sanghá, Saddhara, Sudatta, Yasavatí and Visákhá, each with eighty four thousand companions. Together they will leave the household and arrive on the same day at the Bodhi tree. After the Enlightenment the Buddha will preach in Nágavana and King Sankha will, later, ordain himself under him. Metteyya's father will be Subrahmá, chaplain to King Sankha, and his mother </data>
<data>Brahmavatí. His chief disciples will be Asoka and Brahmadeva among monks, and Padumá and Sumaná among nuns. Síha will be his personal attendant and his chief patrons Sumana, Sangha, Yasavatí and Sanghá. His Bodhi will be the Nága tree. After the Buddha's death, his teachings will continue for one hundred and eighty thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahávamsa (Mhv.xxxii.81f.; see Mil.159), Kákavannatissa and Viháramahádeví, father and mother of Dutthagámani, will be Metteyya's parents, Dutthagámani himself will be his chief disciple and Saddhátissa his second disciple, while Prince Sáli will be his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the present time the future Buddha is living in the Tusita deva-world (Mhv.xxxii.73). There is a tradition that Nátha is the name of the future Buddha in the deva world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worship of the Bodhisatta Metteyya seems to have been popular in ancient Ceylon, and Dhátusena adorned an image of him with all the equipment of a king and ordained a guard for it within the radius of seven yojanas (Cv.xxxviii.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dappula I. made a statue in honour of the future Buddha fifteen cubits high (Cv.xlv.62). It is believed that Metteyya spends his time in the deva-world, preaching the Dhamma to the assembled gods, and, in emulation of his example, King Kassapa V. used to recite the Abhidhamma in the assemblies of the monks (Cv.lii.47). Parakkamabáhu I. had three statues built in honour of Metteyya (Cv.lxxix.75), while Kittisirirájasíha erected one in the Rajata-vihára and another in the cave above it (Cv.c.248,259). It is the wish of all Buddhists that they meet Metteyya Buddha, listen to his preaching and attain to Nibbána under him. See, e.g., J.vi.594; MT. 687; DhSA.430.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Among his pupils was Yava, son of the king of Benares. He was a good student, and when he was about to leave, the Bodhisatta, foreseeing danger for him, taught him three verses (the verses are in the nature of conundrums, with double meaning). The first two were based on incidents seen by the Bodhisatta – a horse killing the mouse that worried the sore place in his foot and throwing him into the well; and the same horse, later, trying to eat barley by putting its head through the fence; the third was made of his own accord. Later, Yava became king, and his son, when sixteen years old, made three attempts on his life. But they all failed because Yava repeated the stanzas taught him by the Bodhisatta. On each occasion the uttering of the stanzas made the boy feel that he was discovered, and he confessed his guilt, whereupon he was cast into chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Ajátasattu (J.iii.215 9). For details see the Thusa Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Medakathaliká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pupil of a &quot;bamboo acrobat&quot; (candálavamsika) (See KS.v.148, n.3) of long ago. His master called to him one day and asked him to climb the bamboo and to stand on his shoulder. Then the master suggested that they should watch and look after each other during their performances. But Medakathaliká said that each should look after himself, which would be the better way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.iii.182) adds that, in this performance, the end of the pole rests on the forehead or throat. The man who thus holds it must watch the balance closely and not attend to the man at the end of the pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha related this story at Desaká, in the Sumbha country, to the monks, and said that, in the same way, each monk should look after himself; by guarding oneself, one guards another; this is done by the cultivation of the four satipatthánas (S.v.168f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Medakathaliká, though feminine in inflection, is used for a male (SA.iii.181).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Milakkha Tissa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a hunter who lived near Gámendavála vihára in Rohana. One day he caught an animal, which he killed and cooked, and then was filled with a great thirst. Looking for water, he came to the vihára. There he drank ten pots of water, but his thirst was still unquenched, and while he complained bitterly about the absence of water, Cúlapindapátika Tissa Thera heard him and, looking about, saw plenty of water. He then knew that the man's evil kamma was asserting itself. The Elder poured water on to the man's hands, but it all dried up. The man, realizing his wickedness, was greatly alarmed, and went and set all the captive animals free and destroyed his traps. He then returned to the monastery and asked to be ordained. His request was granted, and the Elder gave him a formula for meditation. One day, while learning the Devadúta Sutta, Tissa wished to know how fierce were the fires of hell, and his teacher showed him how one spark of the fire could reduce to ashes a whole heap of wood. This induced Tissa to put forth even greater effort, and he spent all his time in meditation living sometimes in Cittalapabbata vihára and sometimes in Gámendavála vihára with a wet blanket round his head and his feet in water. Then, one day, he heard a novice recite the Arunavatí Sutta and he became an anágámin, attaining arahantship in due course (AA.i.21f.; SA.ii.199f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is quoted as an example of one who strove hard to rid himself of sloth and torpor.

It is like a cauldron filled up to the brim with molten metal (SNA.ii.480).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mhv.iv.38) that when Kálásoka attempted to extend his patronage to the Vajjiputtaka monks, the devas frightened him with a dream that be had been cast into Lohakumbhí.

In it was the Supatittha cetiya, where the Buddha stayed during his first visit to Rájagaha from Gayásísa, after the Enlightenment. There Bimbisára visited him with twelve nahutas of followers, and Uruvela Kassapa dispelled their doubts by declaring his acceptance of the Buddha as his teacher. It was during this visit that Bimbisára gifted Veluvana to the Buddha and his Order (Vin.i.35ff.; DhA.i.88; AA.i.166; BuA.18, etc.). Eleven nahutas, with Bimbisára at their head, became sotápannas at the end of the Buddha's sermon, which included the Mahánárada Kassapa Játaka. The remaining nahuta was established in the Refuges (J.i.84; AA.i.57; also J.vi.219). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grove evidently received its name from its green liquorice creepers, hence its description as Latthimadhukavana (E.g., J.i.68). Hiouen Thsang calls it Yastivana and describes it as a grove of bamboos, giving accounts of its origin and various stories connected with it.

The king of Benares, having heard at night four sounds &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-  du, sa, na, so &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-  uttered by four beings who dwelt in hell, was greatly frightened. When he consulted his purohita, the latter ordained a fourfold sacrifice. The Bodhisatta, seeing the fate that lay in wait for numerous creatures, went to the king's park and there, with the help of the purohita's chief disciple &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-  not himself in favour of the sacrifice - explained to the king the meaning of the sounds and had the sacrificial animals released. The purohita's disciple is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;, who one night heard four syllables uttered by four inhabitants of hell. These had once been nobles of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, guilty of adultery. After death they were born in four iron cauldrons. After sixty thousand years they had gradually come to the top of these cauldrons and had uttered these syllables in their attempt to proclaim their misery. The king, very frightened, consulted his priests, who ordered a sacrifice. But &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa')"&gt;Malliká&lt;/a&gt; intervened and sent the king to see the Buddha, who explained the matter and allayed the king's fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.iii.43 8; the stories, both of the past and present, appear also at DhA.ii.5ff. and PvA.279ff.

In the Commentaries (AA.ii.653f.; M.A.i.546f.; DA.ii.534f ) we find two stories about a monk named Tissa, who lived there. Once, five hundred monks, on their way to Nágadípa, reached Khíragáma and went into the village for alms, but returned with empty bowls. When Tissa. discovered this, he went into the village, whence he shortly returned with his bowl full of milk rice, which he served to the five hundred monks, keeping some for himself. When asked whether he possessed supernormal power, Tissa replied that he practised Sáráníyadhammá, as a result of which his bowl was never empty even after he had served as many as one thousand monks from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other story relates how, when Tissa was still a novice, he went to the Giribhanda festival. There, having heard that the costliest offering was a pair of robes, he openly wished that he should get them. The king heard of this and tried to prevent Tissa from having the robes, but this effort was unsuccessful. The king was amazed, and, on questioning Tissa, the reply was to the same effect as that of the first story. v.l. Lenagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>

When the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; heard of this he related the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somadatta_jat_211_410')"&gt;Somadatta Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, showing that in past births, too, Láludayí had possessed the same propensity. He is identified with the foolish father (Agnidatta) of the story (J.ii.167; DhA.iii.125). We also read of his jealousy of the praises bestowed on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; for their knowledge and exposition of the Law, and he claimed that he possessed knowledge equal to theirs. But one day when asked to preach, he sat on a seat holding a painted fan, but found nothing to say. He thereupon agreed to preach in the evening; but the same thing happened, and he barely escaped with his life, so furious was his audience. The Buddha, on hearing of this, related the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suukara_jat_153')"&gt;Súkara Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (in which Láludáyí was the pig), showing that in the past, too, he had covered himself with disgrace because of his boastfulness. J.ii.344ff.; but according to the introductory story of the Játaka itself (in J.ii.9ff.), Láludáyí's name is not mentioned, and the incident described differs somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, he had a dispute with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabba_mallaputta_th')"&gt;Dabba Mallaputta&lt;/a&gt; regarding the allotment of the rice tickets, and the monks, in order to teach him a lesson, handed him the tickets to distribute.

<data>find out what was happening. When Amanda returned with this story, the Buddha related the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tandulanaali_jat_5')"&gt;Tandulanáli Játaka&lt;/a&gt; to show that in the past Láludáyí had been a foolish appraiser (J.i.123ff). The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nangalisa_jat_123')"&gt;Nangalísa Játaka&lt;/a&gt; gives another example of his folly and ineptitude (J.i.446ff); so does also the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padanjali_jat_247')"&gt;Padañjali Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.263f), where he is identified with Padañjali, an idle, lazy loafer. In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546')"&gt;Maháummagga Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.478) he is identified with the somewhat foolish king, Vedeha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Láludáyí once had a discussion with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasura')"&gt;Pasúra&lt;/a&gt;, who, at first, thought him to be clever and wise, and accepted him as teacher, being ordained by him. But, later, Pásura easily defeated him in discussion (SNA.ii.540). Others, too, visiting &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, and seeing him in the Preacher's seat, mistook him for an eminent Elder, but soon discovered their mistake (E.g., DhA.ii.31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one occasion (A.iii.192f.; AA.ii.628) Láludáyí even dared to contradict &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; regarding birth among the manomayadevá ??. Three times Sáriputta repeated his statement and three times Láludáyí contradicted him, and, there being no monk in the assembly who supported Sáriputta, he took Láludáyí to the Buddha, where he three times repeated the same statement, being three times contradicted. Then the Buddha called Láludáyí &quot;a witless fool&quot; and silenced him. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; was witness to the dispute, but took no part in it, thereby winning the Buddha's censure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere (A.iv.414f.; AA.ii.810), however, we find </data>
<data>Láludáyí listening in all humility to a discourse by Sáriputta on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/n_r/nibbaana')"&gt;Nibbána&lt;/a&gt;, as the happiness which is not sensed (avedayitasukha). Though Udáyí's knowledge of the Dhamma was not profound, he did not hesitate to take part in a discussion, even with the Buddha himself, when occasion arose. We find him twice censured by the Buddha for this exhibition of his ignorance, once in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kammavibhanga_s')"&gt;Mahákamma vibhanga Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.208) and once again in a discussion on&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/a/anussati')"&gt;anussati&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.322f). In both instances Ananda is present, and, in the discussion on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/a/anussati')"&gt;anussati&lt;/a&gt;, he earns the Buddha's praise for his knowledge compared with Udáyí's ignorance. This annoyed Udáyí, for we find him confronting Ananda with the fact that though he had been in the constant society of the Buddha he had not profited by it, a remark which earned the censure of the Buddha and his assurance that Ananda would certainly reach perfection in that very life (A.i.228; AA.i.441).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.ii.7; some of the MSS. read nátakácariyaputta ) calls Láludáyí Kovariyaputta. It is not clear whether this means that his father was called Kovariya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vinaya (Vin.iii.110) mentions a monk called Udáyí who was a colleague of Seyyasaka. He persuaded Seyyasaka to commit the first Sanghádisesa offence, saying that he himself acted likewise. For this the Mánatta penalty was imposed on him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentaries, (Sp.iii.517; DhA.iii.5) this Udáyí is to be identified with Láludáyí, and if this be correct, it was perhaps the same monk who was guilty of several Vinaya offences attributed to Udáyi - see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udaayii')"&gt;Udáyi (2)&lt;/a&gt; - though the Vinaya </data>
<data>Commentary does not elsewhere (E.g., Sp.iii.541, 549, 552, where he is simply called Udáyi) definitely so identify him, except once (Sp.iv.804), where he is mentioned as having made an embroidered robe for a nun, which he persuaded her to wear in the assembly of the nuns! Was this because the Commentator regarded the two Udáyis as distinct persons? (E.g., MA.i.348).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Láludáyí is given as an example of a person who did no good either to himself or to others (neva attahitáya patipanno no parahitáya). Buddhaghosa elsewhere (Sp.iii.517) describes him as “bhantamigasappatibhágo niddárámatádim anuyuttánam aññataro lolabhikkhu.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.

Beings are born there as a result of heinous crimes, &quot;like those of Coranága, or Corábhaya, both of Tambannidípa.&quot; Their bodies are three gávutas in height and with their long nails they cling to the cakkaválapabbata. Sometimes they fall into the world bearing water (lokasandhárakaudaka) and are dried up because of its great salinity (AA.ii.532). Elsewhere (NidA.8; SNA.i.59) they are said to suffer from extreme cold. Those holding wrong views are also born there (J.vi.247). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA., p. 26), Lokantara is the hell of the Asurakáyá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The twelfth sutta of the Dígha Nikáya, containing the discussion between the Buddha and Lohicca of Sálávatiká. The underlying argument of the sutta is that everyone should be allowed to learn; that everyone possessing certain attainments should be allowed to teach; but that if he does teach, he should teach all and to all, keeping nothing back, shutting no one out. But no man should take upon himself to teach unless he has first taught himself, and has acquired the faculty of imparting to others the truth he has gained himself.

Udáyí recalls the rules made by the Buddha regarding the hours for meals, how such rules were added to, until, in the end, any meal out of hours was forbidden; and he mentions how, though at first these rules involved hardship, in the end they were very helpful in dispelling unhappy states of consciousness and in implanting happy ones. The Buddha agrees, but adds that many people are foolish, and consider such sacrifices insignificant, growing discontented when asked to make them. But this insignificant thing develops into a bond strong enough to hold them fast. Some people are like quails caught in traps, unable to escape from their bonds, others like mighty elephants, bursting their bonds and going where they wish. Thus there are four types of individuals, differing according as to whether they are attached to their bonds or detached from them. M.i.447-56; MA.ii.656-60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Bodhisatta discovered this, and one day brought dice smeared with dried poison. The sharper played his usual tricks, and suffered great pain from the poison.

When Sáriputta reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha declared that he had tested the efficacy of asceticism ninety kappas ago and had found it wanting.

In his village lived one thousand families, and on the day of his conception they all had to starve and various misfortunes gradually befell them. By a process of exclusion, they discovered that their misfortunes were due to Losaka's family, and therefore drove them out. As soon as Losaka could walk, his mother put a potsherd into his hand and sent him to beg. He wandered about uncared for, picking up lumps of rice like a crow. One day, when he was seven years old, Sáriputta saw him and, feeling pity for him, ordained him. But he was always unlucky; wherever he went, begging for alms, he received but little and never had a real meal. In due course he became an arahant, and when the time came for him to die Sáriputta determined that he should have a proper meal. He went with Losaka to Sávatthi, but no one would even notice them. He then took Losaka back to the monastery and, having collected food himself, sent it to Losaka, but the messengers entrusted with it ate it all themselves. It was afternoon when Sáriputta discovered this; he therefore went to the king's palace and, having obtained a bowl filled with catumadhura (honey, ghee, butter and sugar), took it to Losaka and asked him to eat out of the bowl as he (Sáriputta) held it, in case the food should disappear. That night Losaka died, and a shrine was erected over his ashes (J.i.234f). When the Buddha was asked why Losaka was so unlucky, he related the Losaka Játaka (q.v.). Losaka is identified with Mittavindaka of that story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Lanká, Lankádípa, Lankátala&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Páli names for Ceylon, found in the Chronicles -  e.g., Dipavamsa, Mahávamsa and the Commentaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ancient tradition recorded in the Mahávamsa (Mhv.xv. 57ff), and in the Samantapásádiká (Sp.i.86ff), gives the names of the Island in the times of the three previous Buddhas, the names of the capital cities, the different names of Mahámeghavana, and of the kings contemporary with these Buddhas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Thus, in the time of Kakusandha, the Island was called   Ojadípa, the king was Abhaya, the capital Abhayapura and Mahámeghavana,   Mahátittha. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the time of Konágamana, the Island was Varadípa, the   capital Vaddhamána, the king Samiddha and the park Mahánoma. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the time of Kassapa, the Island was Mandadípa, the   king Jayanta, the capital Visálá and the park Maháságara. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Mahámeghavana, the other physical feature of Ceylon, mentioned in these accounts, is the mountain known in the present age as Sumanakúta, whereon the Buddha Gotama placed his footprint. During the ages of the three previous Buddhas, it was known, respectively, as Devakúta, Sumanakútaka and Subhakúta. Gotama paid three visits to Ceylon, while the other three Buddhas came only once. During their visits they consecrated various spots by spending there a short time wrapt in meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lanká was once inhabited by Yakkhas. Gotama Buddha obliged them to leave the Island and seek shelter in the neighboring Giridípa. Lankádípa was later colonized by Vijaya and his three hundred companions. Two cities of the Yakkhas are mentioned: Sirísavatthu and Lankápura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Latukika Játaka (No. 357)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quail once laid her eggs in the feeding ground of the elephants. When the young ones were hatched, the Bodhisatta, the leader of the elephants, passed along that way with the herd, and, at the request of the mother quail, carefully avoided the young ones. But a rogue elephant, who came after, though warned in the same way, trod on the nest and fouled it. The quail swore revenge, and got a crow to put out the elephant's eyes and a fly to put maggots in them, and when the elephant, in great pain, looked for water, she persuaded a frog to croak on the mountain top and thus to lead the elephant into a precipice down which he fell and was killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta who was identified with the rogue elephant (J.iii.174 77). In the accounts (see Rohiní ) of the quarrel between the Sákyans and the Koliyans, this Játaka is said to have been one of those preached by the Buddha on that occasion, showing that even such a weak animal as a quail could sometimes cause the death of an elephant. Perhaps the story was related on more than one occasion. See also below, Latukikopama sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See DhA.i.46, where it is related to the Kosambí monks to show the danger of quarrelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One of the eight brahmins who recognized the   auspicious signs at the birth of the Buddha (J.i.56). The Milinda (Mil. 236)   speaks of him as one of the Buddha's first teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;a name="2. Lakkhana"&gt;Lakkhana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt; Thera&lt;/b&gt;. Mentioned as having stayed with Mahá Moggallána on Gijjhakúta. Once, when they were going down to Rájagaha for alms, Lakkhana noticed that at a certain spot Moggallána smiled; on asking him why, he was told to wait till they saw the Buddha. When the question was repeated in the Buddha's presence, Moggallána said that he had smiled on seeing various Petas with gruesome forms flying through the air. From the text it would appear that these visions were seen again on several occasions. S.ii.254; Vin.iii.104ff.; the stories of some of the Petas seen and of their past lives are given in detail in DhA.ii.68ff.; iii.60ff.; 410ff., 479.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.ii.159) explains that Lakkhana was one of the thousand Jatilas ordained by the Buddha (when he converted the Tebhátika Jatilas). He attained arahantship at the conclusion of the preaching of the Ádittapariyáyadesaná. He was called Lakkhana because of his marvellous personality, &quot;like unto Brahmá's&quot; (brahmasamena). It adds further that Lakkhana's failure to see the Petas was not because he lacked the divine eye but because he was not giving attention (anávajjento), as a clairvoyant must. It is </data>
<data>said (Vin.iii.105) that when Moggallána related his vision, some of the monks blamed him for claiming superhuman powers (uttarimanussadhamma), but the Buddha declared him free from blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Licchaví&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A powerful tribe of India in the time of the Buddha. They were certainly khattiyas, for on that ground they claimed a share of the Buddha's relics. D.ii.165; according to the Mtu.i.283, etc., they belonged to the Vásistha gotta; cp. the Mallas (q.v.), who are called Vásetthas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their capital was Vesáli, and they formed a part of the Vajjian confederacy, being often referred to as the Vajjís (q.v.). Their strength lay in their great unity; if one Licchavi fell ill, all the others would visit him. The whole tribe would join in any ceremony performed in the house of Licchavi, and they would all unite in honouring any distinguished visitors to their city (DA.ii.519). They were beautiful to look at and wore brilliantly coloured garments, riding in brightly painted carriages (D.ii.96; A.iii.219: cp. Mtu.i.259). The Buddha once compared them to the gods of Távatimsa (D.ii.96; also DhA.iii.280).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though this would seem to indicate that they were very prosperous and rich, they do not appear to have lived in luxury and idleness. They are, on the contrary, spoken of (S.ii.267f) as sleeping on straw couches, being strenuous and diligent and zealous in their service (as skilful hardy archers, says the Commentary). They also practised seven conditions of welfare (apariháníyadhammá), which the Buddha claimed to have taught them at the Sárandada cetiya: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) They held frequent public meetings of their tribe   which they all attended; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) they met together to make their decisions and   carried out their undertakings in concord; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) they upheld tradition and honoured their pledges;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) they respected and supported their elders;   &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;(5) no women or girls were allowed to be taken by force   or abduction; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(6) they maintained and paid due respect to their   places of worship; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(7) they supported and fully protected the holy men   (arahants) among them (D.ii.73f.; A.iv.15f).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young men among the Licchavis were evidently fond of archery, for mention is made (A.iii.76) of large numbers of them roving about in the Mahávana, with bows and arrows, the strings set, and surrounded by hounds. They were a martial people and fond of &quot;sport,&quot; but we find one of their Elders, Mahánáma complaining (A.iii.76, the Lalitavistara is even more condemnatory) of them to the Buddha: &quot;The Licchavi youths are quick tempered, rough and greedy fellows; such presents as are sent by the members of their tribe   sugar cane, jujubes, sweet cakes, sweetmeats, etc.   they loot and eat; they slap the women and girls of their tribe on the back.&quot; Violation of chastity was considered a serious offence among the Licchavis, and the assembly would even give its consent to a husband's request that his unfaithful wife should be murdered (Vin.iv.225).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Buddhist books, the Licchavis were devout followers of the Buddha and held him in the highest esteem. Five hundred Licchavis once gave a garment each to Pingiyáni, because he recited a verse in praise of the Buddha (A.iii.239). Even careless boys, referred to above as wandering about with hounds and bows and arrows, would lay aside their arms when they saw the Buddha seated under a tree and would surround him with clasped hands, eager to hear him (A.iii.76). There were numerous shrines in Vesáli itself, several of which are mentioned by name: Cápála, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, Gotama, Sárandada and Udena. Buddhaghosa says (E.g., UdA.322f ) that these </data>
<data>shrines were originally Yakkha cetiyas, where various Yakkhas were worshipped, but that they were later converted into monasteries for the Buddha and his Order. It is, however, apparent from the Buddhist books themselves (E.g., in the story of the general Síha), that Vesáli was also a stronghold of the Jains. The Buddha visited Vesáli at least three times, and is frequently mentioned as staying in Kútágárasálá (q.v.) in Mahávana. The first visit was in order to destroy the threefold panic of drought, sickness and non human foes. It was probably this act which earned for the Buddha the gratitude of the Licchavis. There the Licchavis visited him in large numbers, sometimes (E.g., A.v.133f ) disturbing the calm of the spot and obliging resident monks to seek peace in Gosingasálávana near by. Once, five hundred Licchavis invited the Buddha to a discussion held by them at the Sárandada-cetiya regarding the five kinds of treasures. The Buddha went and gave his opinion (A.iii.167f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all the Licchavis were followers of the Buddha. When Saccaka the Nigantha visited the Buddha at Mahávana, he was accompanied by five hundred Licchavis, who did not all salute the Buddha as their teacher, but showed him only such respect as was due to an honoured stranger (M.i.229; MA.i.454 gives their reasons). Several eminent Licchavis are specially mentioned by name as having visited and consulted the Buddha; among whom are Mahánáma, Síha, Bhaddiya, Sálha, Abhaya, Panditakumára, Nandaka, Maháli and Ugga. Several Licchavis, both men and women, joined the Order - e.g., the famous courtesan Ambapálí, Jentí, Síhá and Vásitthí, and, among monks, Añjanavaniya, Vajjiputta and Sambhúta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Licchavis were greatly admired for their system of government. It was a republic (gana, sangha), all the leading members of which were called rájá. According to Mtu.i.271, there were 68,000 rájás in Vesáli; the </data>
<data>Játakas (i.504; iii.1) speak of 7707; DhA.iii.436.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They held full and frequent assemblies at which problems affecting either the whole republic or individual members were fully discussed. When the assembly drum was heard, all left other duties and assembled immediately in the Santhágárasálá (DA.ii.517f). Sometimes, as appears from the story of the conversion of Síha, religion was also discussed at these meetings. The rules of procedure adopted evidently resembled those followed in the upasatitpáda ordination of a monk. See D.ii.76f., where the Buddha enjoins on the monks the observance of the same habits as practised by the Licchavis. These are given at Vin.i.56 (VT.i.169f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the rájás there were also numerous uparájás, senápatis, and bhandágárikas (J.iii.1). There was an elaborate judicial procedure by which any person charged with an offence was handed over, in turn, to the Vinicchayamahámattas (inquirers), the Vohárikas (experts in law), Suttadharas (experts in tradition), the Atthakulakas (probably a judicial committee), the Senápati, the Uparájá, and finally to the Rájá, who would inflict the proper sentence according to the pavenipotthaka (DA.ii.519).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their political relationships with their neighbours, the Licchavis seem to have been on friendly terms with Bimbisára (q.v.), king of Magadha, and with Pasenadi, king of Kosala (See, e.g., M.ii.101, where Pasenadi says this). Generally speaking, they were friendly also with the Mallas, though the story of Bandhula (q.v.) shows that a certain amount of rivalry existed between the two tribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the death of Bimbisára, Ajátasattu, in his desire for the expansion of Magadha, resolved to destroy the Licchavis. He was probably partly influenced by his fear of his foster brother Abhayarájakumára (q.v.), who had in him Licchavi blood. Buddhaghosa gives another story. (DA.ii.516f.; </data>
<data>AA.ii.703; was the port Pátaligáma? see UdA.408). There was a port on the Ganges, extending over one yojana, half of which territory belonged to Ajátasattu, and the other half to the Licchavis. Near by was a mountain, from which much fragrant material (? gandhabhanda) flowed into the river. While Ajátasattu was making preparations to claim his portion of this material, the Licchavis would go before him and remove it all. This happened on several occasions, and Ajátasattu vowed vengeance. In order to discover what the Buddha thought of his chances of success, he sent to him his minister Vassakára. The Buddha predicted (D.ii.72ff ) that as long as the Licchavis remained united they were proof against any foe. Ajátasattu then decided to bring about disunion among them. He was successful in this, with the aid of Vassakára. (For details see Vassakára). When Ajátasattu arrived at the gates of Vesáli, the Licchavis, owing to their disunion, were unable to put up any opposition, and Ajátasattu captured the city without further trouble (DA.ii.524). The degeneration may have set in earlier among the Licchavis, for we find reference to their giving up their earlier austere habits and to their fondness for soft pillows, long sleep and other luxuries. (S.ii.268; see also DhA.iii.280, where they quarrel over a woman; cp. Sp.i.284). Their power and prosperity were probably also weakened by the plague and drought which had ravaged Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries contain a mythical account of the origin of the Licchavis. (MA.i.258; KhpA. etc.; for a very comprehensive account of the Licchavis, see Law, Ksatriya Clans in Buddhist India, pp.1ff). The queen of Benares gave birth to a lump of flesh, and, wishing to avoid disgrace, her ladies in waiting put it in a sealed casket and threw it into the Ganges. A deva wrote the king's name on the casket, which was picked up by an ascetic, who </data>
<data>tended the embryo until two children, a boy and a girl, emerged from it. The ascetic fed them with milk. Whatever entered the stomachs of the children could be seen as though the stomach were transparent, so that they appeared skinless (nicchavi); some said the skin was so thin (línachaví) that the stomach and whatever entered it appeared as though sewn together. From this the children came to be called Licchavi, and, as they grew, were brought up by the villagers living near the hermitage. The other children disliked them, saying they were to be avoided (vajjitabbá) because of their quarrelsome disposition. When they were sixteen years old the villagers obtained land for them from the king, founded a town, and married them together. Their country came to be called Vajjí. They had sixteen pairs of twins, and their city had to be greatly enlarged -  hence its name, Visálá or Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Lohapásáda&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A building at Anurádhapura, forming the uposatha hall of the Mahávihára. It was originally built by Devánampiyatissa (see Mhv.xv.205), but it was then a small building erected only to round off the form of Mahá vihára (viháraparipunnamattasádhakam) (MT. 364). Later, Dutthagámani pulled it down and erected on its site a nine storey building, one hundred cubits square and high, with one hundred rooms on each storey. The building was planned according to a sketch of the Ambalatthikapásáda (the actual Ambalatthiká (q.v.) of the Lohapásáda was to the east of the building, DA.ii.635) in Bíraní's palace which eight arahants obtained from the deva world. The building was roofed with copper plates, hence its name. The nine storeys were occupied by monks, according to their various attainments, the last four storeys being reserved for arahants. In the centre of the hall was a seat made in the shape of Vessavana’s Náríváhana chariot (for details see Mhv.xxvii.1ff). The building was visible out at sea to a distance of one league (MT. 505). Once Dutthagámani attempted to preach in the assembly hall of the Lohapásáda, but he was too nervous to proceed. Realizing then how difficult was the task of preachers, he endowed largesse for them in every vihára (Mhv.xxxii.42ff). Dutthagámani had always a great fondness for the Lohapásáda, and as he lay dying he managed to have a last view of it (Mhv.xxxii.9). Thirty crores were spent on its construction; in Saddhátissa's day it caught fire from a lamp, and he rebuilt it in seven storeys at a cost of nine millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khallátanága built thirty two other pásádas round the Lohapásáda for its ornamentation (Mhv.xxxiii.6), while Bhátikábhaya carried out various repairs to the building (Mhv.xxxiv.39), and Amandagámaní added an inner </data>
<data>courtyard and a verandah (ájira) (Mhv.xxxv.3). Sirinága I. rebuilt it in five storeys (Mhv.xxxvi.25,52), Abhayanága built a pavilion in the courtyard and Gothábhaya had the pillars renewed (Mhv.xxxvi.102).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He evidently started to rebuild the structure, because we are told (Mhv.xxxvi.124) that, after his death, his son Jetthatissa completecd up to seven storeys the Lohapásáda which had been left unfinished (vippakata) by his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building was worth one crore, and Jetthatissa offered to it a jewel worth sixty thousand, after which he renamed it Manipásáda. Afterwards Sona, a minister of his brother, the renegade king Mahánáma, acting on the advice of heretical monks led by Sanghamitta, destroyed the pásáda and carried away its wealth to enrich Abhayagiri vihára (Mhv.xxxvii.10f,59).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahánáma's son, Sirimeghavanna, had the pásáda restored to its original form (Mhv.xxxvii.62), and, later, Dhátusena renovated it (Mhv.xxxviii.54), as did Aggabodhi I., who distributed the three garments to thirty six thousand monks at the festival of dedication and assigned a village to provide for its protection (Mhv.xlii.20). His successor, Aggabodhi II., deposited in the pásáda the Buddha's right collar bone, which relic was later transferred to the Thúpáráma (Mhv.xlii.53,59). In the reign of Aggabodhi IV., the ruler of Malaya repaired the central pinnacle (Mhv.xlvi.30), while Mánavamma provided a new roof (Mhv.xlvii.65). Sena II. completely restored the pásáda and placed in it an image of the Buddha in gold mosaic. The building was evidently not in use at the time, but he provided for its upkeep and assigned villages for its protection, and decreed that thirty two monks should be in constant residence (Mhv.li.69f). Sena IV. was in the habit of preaching in the Lohapásáda periodical sermons to the monks (Mhv.liv.4) which were based on the suttas, but, </data>
<data>after his death, the place again fell into disrepair and was destroyed by the Colas. Parakkamabáhu I. restored it once again (Mhv.lxxviii.102), but it was soon after pillaged again and fell into ruin, in which state it remains to this day. There are now sixteen hundred monolithic stone columns (the same number as in the time of Parakkamabáhu I.), which evidently formed the framework of the lowest storey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent mention is made in the books of sermons preached in the lowest storey of the Lohapásáda, at which very large numbers were present. Once, when Ambapásánavásí Cittagutta preached the Rathaviníta Sutta, there were twelve thousand monks and one thousand nuns (MT.552f). On another occasion, Bhátikábhaya described the contents of the Relic chamber of the Mahá Thúpa to all the monks of the Mahávihára assembled in the Lohapásáda (MT.555).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.581) that, up to his day, it was customary for all the monks of Ceylon, who lived to the north of the Maháválukanadí, to assemble in the Lohapásáda twice a year, on the first and last days of the vassa, while those to the south of the river assembled at the Tissamahávihára. When disputes arose as to the interpretation of various rules or teachings, the decision was often announced by a teacher of repute from the lowest storey of the Lohapásáda (DA.ii.442, 514).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hood of the Nága king Mucalinda was of the same size as the storehouse (bhandágáragabbha) of the Lohapásáda (UdA.101). A mass of rock, as big as the seventh storey of the Lohapásáda, if dropped from the Brahmaworld, would take four months to reach the earth. DA.ii.678.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once when Mahá Kaccána was living there in a forest hut, a number of Lohicca’s pupils came there and began abusing the monks, calling them shavelings, menials, etc. Kaccána talked to them, telling them how degenerate were the brahmins, differing from brahmins of old, the present ones being backsliders, mere reciters, doing things for trifling gains. The pupils went back to Lohicca and told him this. Lohicca visited Kaccána and discussed with him these statements, and, at the end of the talk, declared himself Kaccána's follower. S.iv.117ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Lohicca. &lt;/b&gt; A brahmin of Sálávatiká. He once conceived the idea that a samana or recluse who had reached a good state of mind should tell no one else of it, lest he should entangle himself in new bonds. When the Buddha went to Sálávatiká Lohicca sent the barber, Bhesiká, to invite the Buddha and the monks in his name. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and, at the end of the meal, questioned Lohicca regarding his views. At the end of the discussion Lohicca became the Buddha’s follower.

The title was a higher one than that of   Jayamahálekhaka, which was conferred on Sumitta. See Mbv., p. 164f., for a   description of the ceremony of investiture.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Lomasakassapa Játaka (No. 433)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Kassapa, son of the chaplain to the king of Benares. He and the king's son shared a teacher and became friends. When the prince became king, Kassapa, having no desire for power, left him and became an ascetic. Because of the thick hair on his body, men called him Lomasakassapa. Sakka grew frightened of Kassapa's power and, wishing to destroy it, appeared before the king at midnight and suggested to him that if he could persuade Kassapa to offer a sacrifice of slain beasts, he should be king over all India. The king, therefore, sent his minister Sayha, to fetch Kassapa to him. When Kassapa heard of the proposal he refused to go, but Sakka appeared again before the king and said that if the king's daughter, Candavadí, were offered as reward, Kassapa would come. This proposal was agreed to, and Kassapa, tempted by the princess's beauty, agreed to come. The people gathered at the place of sacrifice and tried to dissuade Kassapa from slaying the animals, but he refused to listen. Many beasts were slain, and as he raised his sword to cut off the head of the royal elephant the latter raised a cry in which all the animals joined. Roused by this uproar, Kassapa remembered his asceticism and was filled with remorse. He admonished the king, and, sitting cross-legged in the air, developed transcendental power, which enabled him to fly through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a passion tossed monk. Sayha ifs identified with Sáriputta. J.iii.514ff.; the story forms one of the dilemmas of the Milinda-Pañha, p. 219. There Kassapa is stated to have performed the Vájapeyya sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One pupil asked him how people could obtain gain in this world. His teacher answered that in a world full of fools the man who slanders, possesses the tricks of an actor and carries evil talk, gains prosperity. The pupil expressed his disappointment and continued his religious life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a colleague who asked Sáriputta the same question and received the above answer.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Lakuntaka Bhaddiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in a wealthy family of Sávatthi and was given the title of Lakuntaka (Dwarf) owing to his very small stature. He was, nevertheless, beautiful in body, says the ApA.; but see below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and became learned and eloquent, teaching others in a sweet voice. Once, on a festival day, a woman of the town, driving with a brahmin in a chariot, saw the Elder and laughed, showing her teeth. The Elder, taking the teeth as his object, developed jhána and became an anágámí. Later, after being admonished by Sáriputta, he developed mindfulness regarding the body and became an arahant. The Udána (vii.1, 2) makes reference to the admonitions of Sáriputta and to the Buddha's joy when these had the desired effect. The Commentary (UdA.360f.) gives details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a very rich householder of Hamsavatí, and, having beard the Buddha describe one of his monks as the sweetest voiced among them all, he wished for a similar distinction for himself under a future Buddha. In the time of Phussa Buddha he was a cittapattakokila, named Nanda, (the Ap.loc.infra says he was the king’s general) who, seeing the Buddha in the royal park, placed in his bowl a ripe mango. In Kassapa Buddhas day he was the chief architect entrusted with the building of the thúpa over the Buddha's relics, and, when a dispute arose as to how big the thúpa should be, he decided in favour of a small one; hence his small stature in his last life. ThagA.i.469ff.; Ap.ii.489f; the account in AA.i.110f. is slightly different; the Kelisíla Játaka (q.v.) gives a different reason for his shortness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the assembly of monks the Buddha ranked him as foremost among sweet voiced monks (A.i.25) (mañjussaránam). Several stories connected </data>
<data>with Bhaddiya are recorded in the books. Because of his shortness and his youthful appearance he was sometimes mistaken for a novice (DhA.iii.387). Elsewhere (S.ii.279; cp. Ud.vii.5) it is said that, because he was ugly and hunch backed, he was despised by his companions, and the Buddha had to proclaim to them his greatness and hold him up as an example of a man who, though small, was of great power. Another account relates how novices used to pull his hair and tweak his ears and nose saying, &quot;Uncle, you tire not of religion? You take delight in it?&quot; But he showed no resentment and took no offence. DhA.ii.148; the introduction to the Kelisíla Játaka, (J.ii.142) speaks of thirty monks from the country who, seeing Bhaddiya at Jetavana, pulled him about until they were told by the Buddha who he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in reference to Bhaddiya that the Buddha preached two famous riddle stanzas in the Dhammapada (294, 295; for the explanation of the riddle see DhA.iii.454), where he describes the arahant as one who has killed father and mother and two kings and destroyed a kingdom, but who yet goes scathe less   the words having a metaphorical meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several stanzas uttered by Bhaddiya in the Ambátakavana, as he sat there enjoying the bliss of arahantship, are included in the Theragáthá (Thag.vss.466 72). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Avadánasataka he is called Lakuñcika. See Avs.ii.152 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He ruled for six years over Rohana, his seat of government being in Kájaragáma.   A chieftain named Buddharája quarrelled with him and fled to Cunnasálá, where   he was joined by Kitti (afterwards Vijayabáhu I.).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Lambakanná&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gotta, mentioned in the Chronicles as being among the inhabitants of Ceylon. The Lambakannas had, probably, certain duties to perform in connection with the consecration of a king. This was perhaps the reason why Parakkamabáhu I. gave them a prominent place in the ceremonies held in honour of the Tooth Relic (Cv.lxxiv.213); see also below, in the text. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find that Ilanága, when be went to take his ceremonial bath in Tissavápi, was enraged on finding that the Lambakanná were not there. As a punishment, he ordered them to work at the remaking of a road along the bank of the tank, leading to the Mahá Thúpa, and set candalas to supervise them. Full of anger, the Lambakannas rose in revolt and seized the throne. Three years later the king returned from exile, and, having defeated the Lambakannas, made them drag his chariot in triumphal procession. When he proposed to behead them his mother intervened, and he contented himself with having their noses and toes cut off (Mhv.xxxv.18ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lambakannas were evidently a powerful clan, and several members of the clan ruled as kings of Ceylon -  e.g., Vasabha, Sanghatissa, Sanghabodhi and Gothábhaya, the last three of whom came from Mahiyangana and seized the throne from Vijayakumára (Mhv.xxxvi.58ff). Between the reign of Kittisirimegha and the Coliyan conquest in 1017 A.C.   i.e., between the third and the eleventh centuries   out of thirty six kings who occupied the throne of Ceylon the majority belonged to either the Moriyá or the Lambakanná. A clan of Lambakannas lived also in South India in the twelfth century. When Lankápura, acting under the orders of Parakkamabáhu I., crowned Vírapandu as king of Pandu, three Lambakanna chiefs were asked to carry out &quot;the duties of the Lambakannas&quot; (Lambakannadhuram) (Cv.lxxvii.27f).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The name may have had a totemistic origin, but according to some Singhalese Chronicles (E.g., the Saddharmaratnákara and the Párakumbá-Sirita) the Lambakannas of Ceylon were a branch of the Moriyas. They claimed descent from Sumitta -  a prince of the Moriyan clan, who formed one of the escort that brought the Bodhi-tree from India -  and Sumaná, a princess of the same race, who was at one time a nun, ordained under Sanghamíttá. According to these Chronicles most of the kings of Ceylon down to the time of Parakkamabáhu VI. were scions of this clan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ceylon, the Lambakannas had settlements in Rohana. See, e.g., AA.i.262.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Mahánáma asks the Elder if the learner's way of life is identical with that of the Tathágata. Vangísa answers that it is not so; learners only abandon the five hindrances; arahants have completely destroyed them from the root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview took place in the Nigrodháráma at Kapilavatthu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Lomasavangísa is, probably, a wrong or variant reading for Lomasakangiya (q.v.).

He was the eldest son of Saddhátissa, but, when his father died, the ministers and monks crowned his younger brother, Thúlatthana, king. Lañjatissa killed Thúlatthana after one month, and ruled for nine years and fifteen days. At first he was very indifferent towards the monks, but later made amends. He built the Arittha and Kuñjarahínaka viháras, the Lañjakásanasálá and a stone mantling for the Kanthakathúpa, in addition to other good works. Mhv.xxxiii.14ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was probably (Cv.lxx.218; Cv.Trs.305, n.5) the son of the Lankádhinátha Kitti. We first hear of him as having parried the attack of Gajabáhu's forces, at the pass of Khandigáma. He was later sent in command of the expedition against Kulasekhara, to help the Pandu king, Parakkama of Madhurá. He landed at the Pandu port of Taladilla and occupied Rámissara. From there he advanced to Kundukála. The prisoners whom he sent to Ceylon were used to help in the restoration of the Ratanaváluka cetiya. At Kundukála, Lankápura built the fortress of Parakkamapura. He defeated Kulasekhara and his numerous allies in several battles, and won over some of his allies, such as Ilankiyaráyara, Málavaráyara and Colagangara, by gifts and honours, and captured, among other places, the fortress of Semponmári. He was assisted by Lankápura Deva and Lankágiri Sora, the general Gokanna, the Kesadhátus Loka and Kitti, and an officer named Jagadvijaya. He then captured Mundikkára and several other fortresses and occupied Rájiná. He subdued the Cola and Pandu countries, and is said to have issued coins bearing the name of Parakkamabáhu I., while he restored the Pandu kingdom to Vírapandu. The village of Pandu vijaya was founded by the king to, commemorate the victory of Lankápura. The account of Lankápura's exploits is found in Cv.lxxvi.76ff.; lxxvii.1ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is curious that no mention is made in the Ceylon Chronicles of Lankápura's return to Ceylon, nor of any honours bestowed on him by the king. South Indian inscriptions relate that Lankápura was defeated, and that his head, with those of his officers, was nailed to the gates of Madhurá. </data>

When the time came for gathering the crops, he told his sons to seek refuge in the mountain tracts with their herds.

The same thing happened on their return four months later, and the Boddhisatta praised Lakkhana's intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta and Sáriputta.

Into the monastery belonging to this rich man there came one day an arahant, and the former, liking his appearance, asked him to stay in the monastery, promising to look after him. The arahant agreed, but the incumbent of the monastery grew jealous and told their patron that the arahant was lazy and good for nothing. Some food sent by the patron for the arahant the incumbent threw into the embers. The arahant, reading his thoughts, left and went elsewhere. The monk was seized with remorse and was reborn in hell. In five hundred successive births he was a Yakkha, with never enough to eat; during a further five hundred births he was a dog. Then he was born, under the name of Mittavindaka, in a poor family in Kási. Because of him, dire misfortune befell the family, and he was driven out. In Benares he became a charity scholar under the Bodhisatta, who was a teacher there, but he was so quarrelsome that he was sent away. He married a poor woman and had two children. For a while he was a teacher, but the village in which he lived earned the king's displeasure seven times, their houses caught fire and the water dried up. Having discovered the cause, the villagers drove out Mittavindaka and his family. In a haunted forest the wife and children were eaten up by demons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his wanderings Mittavindaka came to a coastal village, Gambhíra, where he took service in a ship. On the seventh day of the voyage the ship suddenly stopped sailing. Lots were cast, and seven times the lot fell on Mittavindaka, so they put him on a raft and lowered him overboard. He was cast ashore on an island where lived four vimána petas in palaces of crystal, and he </data>
<data>enjoyed happiness with them for seven days. From there he went to an island where lived eight goddesses in palaces of silver, thence to another where lived sixteen in palaces of jewels, thence to another still where lived thirty two in palaces of gold. In each he stayed seven days. From the last he went to an island of ogres. There he seized an ogress wandering about in the shape of a goat, and, when she kicked him, he was hurled into the dry moat of Benares. There goatherds were keeping watch for thieves, and when Mittavindaka seized a goat, hoping to be kicked back to his original place, he was caught. As he was being led away, the Bodhisatta saw and recognized him and persuaded the goatherds to allow him to have him as a slave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="losaka_th')"&gt;Losaka Tissa&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Mittavindaka is identified.

After Kassapa Buddha had preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddekaratta_s')"&gt;Bhaddekaratta Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, a certain monk had talked about it to Lomasakangiya, who, unable to understand it, said, &quot;May I, in the future, be able to teach thee this sutta!&quot; And the other answered &quot;May I ask thee!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present age, Lomasakangiya was born in a Sákiyan family of Kapilavatthu, while the other monk became the deva &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candana')"&gt;Candana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lomasakangiya (so called because he was delicate and the soles of his feet were covered with hair; MA.ii.961 says he was so called because he had only a little down on his body, káyassa ísakalomasákáratáya) did not go with the Sákiyan young men who joined the Order. Noticing this, Candana appeared before him and questioned him on the Bhaddekaratta Sutta. Lomasakangiya did not know it, and Candana reminded him of his past wish. Lomasakangiya, therefore, went to consult the Buddha, and, later, wished to join the Order. He was sent back to obtain his parents' consent. His mother, fearing for his health, would not agree, but he uttered a verse (Thag.27) which convinced her. After his ordination, he went into a forest, and, when his companions warned him against the cold, he repeated the verse, and, being devoted to meditation, soon won arahantship. ThagA.i.84; the story given in Ap.ii.504f., both of the past and the present, differs in several details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Lomasakangiya Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.199f.; cf. Ap.ii.505, according to which, it was this sutta which led to his becoming an arahant), Candana visited Lomasakangiya in the Nigrodháráma in </data>
<data>Kapilavatthu, where he lived after his ordination, and questioned him on the Bhaddekaratta Sutta. When Lomasakangiya again confessed his ignorance, Candana, taught him the verses, and then the former packed his bedding and went to Sávatthi, where the Buddha, at his request, taught him the Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha, he offered nága flowers to the Buddha.

He asks the Buddha to go about among men and make friends and be happy, satisfied with having discovered the path of immortality for himself without feeling it necessary to teach others. But the Buddha refuses his request, and Mára confesses that he has no longer any power over him; he is like a crab whose claws have been broken one by one. The sutta adds that Mára had been awaiting an opportunity to find a flaw in the Buddha for seven years. The Commentary adds six before the Enlightenment and one after. He retires discomfited and sits not far away from the Buddha, brooding, scratching the earth with a stick. S.i.122ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sangíti Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thirty third sutta of the Dígha Nikáya (D.iii.207ff), preached at Ubbhataka, the new Mote Hall of the Mallas of Pává. They had invited the Buddha to consecrate it by preaching there, and this he did until late into the night. Then, seeing that his audience wished for more, he asked Sáriputta to continue the preaching while he himself rested. Sáriputta therefore preached the Sangíti Sutta, at the end of which the Buddha expressed his great appreciation of Sáriputta's exposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta, like the Dasuttara, is arranged in a new plan-  which is regularly followed in the Anguttara Nikáya   of grouping the points or chief items brought forward, numerically, in arithmetical progression - in this case 1 to 10. This scheme is a kind of thematic index to the doctrines scattered through the Four Nikáyas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sarvástivádins held this Sutta in high esteem, and included it (under the name of Sangítipariyáya) among the seven books constituting their Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Tibetan recensions attribute the Sutta to Mahá Kotthita. See Takákusu's article on the Sarvástivádins (J.P.T.S. 1904 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta treats of the dasadhammá (or ten conditions) in much the same way as the Puggala-Paññatti deals with the dasapuggalá (ten individuals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once, when the Buddha was staying there, he gave to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; the opportunity of asking him to live for an eon, but Ananda, because of his un-mindfulness, failed to take it (D.ii.116).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cave was sometimes used as a residence for monks coming from afar (E.g., Vin.ii.76; iii.159).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentaries and the Chronicle the First Council was held in a hall erected by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt; outside the Sattapanniguhá.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Samitigutta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family of Sávatthi and entered the Order after hearing the Buddha preach. He attained to entire purity of conduct, but, because of some action in his former life, was attacked by leprosy, and his limbs gradually decayed. He therefore lived in the infirmary. One day Sáriputta, while visiting the sick, saw him and gave him an exercise on contemplation of feeling. Practising this, Samitigutta developed insight and became an arahant. Then he remembered his past action and uttered a verse (Thag.vs.81).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he was a householder and offered jasmine flowers to Vipassí Buddha. In another birth he saw a Pacceka Buddha and insulted him, calling him a &quot;leprous starveling&quot; and spitting in his presence. For this he suffered long in hell, and was reborn on earth in the time of Kassapa Buddha. He became a Paribbájaka, and, losing his temper with a follower of the Buddha, cursed him   &quot;May you become a leper.&quot; He also soiled the bath powders placed by people at bathing places; hence his affliction in the present age (ThagA.i.175 f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Játipújaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.154.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sáriputta &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Sáriputta Thera. &lt;/b&gt;The chief disciple (aggasávaka) of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. He is also called Upatissa, which was evidently his personal name (M.i.150). The commentators say that Upatissa was the name of his village and that he was the eldest son of the chief family in the village, but other accounts give his village as Nálaka. His father was the brahmin, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vanganta')"&gt;Vanganta&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.ii.84), and his mother, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rupasari')"&gt;Rúpasári&lt;/a&gt;. It was because of his mother's name that he came to be called Sáriputta. In Sanskrit texts his name occurs as Sáriputra, Sáliputra, Sárisuta, Sáradvatíputra. In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/apadaana')"&gt;Apadána&lt;/a&gt; (ii.480) he is also called Sárisambhava.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Upatissa is hardly ever mentioned in the books. He had three younger brothers -  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda')"&gt;Cunda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upasena')"&gt;Upasena&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata')"&gt;Revata&lt;/a&gt; (afterwards called Khadiravaniya) -  and three sisters -  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caalaa')"&gt;Cálá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upacaalaa')"&gt;Upacálá&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sisupacala_theri')"&gt;Sisúpacálá&lt;/a&gt;; all of whom joined the Order. DhA.ii.188; cf. Mtu.iii.50; for details of them see s.v.; mention is also made of an uncle of Sáriputta and of a nephew, both of whom he took to the Buddha, thereby rescuing them from false views (DhA.ii.230 2); &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uparevata')"&gt;Uparevata&lt;/a&gt; was his nephew (SA.iii.175).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Sáriputta's conversion and the account of his past lives, which prepared him for his eminent position as the Buddha's Chief </data>
<data>Disciple, have been given under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Mahá Moggallána&lt;/a&gt;. Sáriputta had a very quick intuition, and he became a&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt; immediately after hearing the first two lines of the stanza spoken by Assaji. After his attainment of sotápatti, Kolita (Moggallána) wished to go with him to Veluvana to see the Buddha, but Sáriputta, always grateful to his teachers, suggested that they should first seek their teacher, Sañjaya, to give him the good news and go with him to the Buddha. But Sañjaya refused to fall in with this plan. Moggallána attained arahantship on the seventh day after his ordination, but it was not till a fortnight later that Sáriputta became an arahant. He was staying, at the time, with the Buddha, in the Súkarakhatalena in Rájagaha, and he reached his goal as a result of hearing the Buddha preach the Vedánapariggaha Sutta to Díghanakha. This account is summarized from DhA.i.73 ff.; AA.i.88 ff.; ThagA.ii.93 ff. Ap.i.15ff.; the story of their conversion is given at Vin.i.38ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the assembly of monks and nuns, Sáriputta was declared by the Buddha foremost among those who possessed wisdom (etadaggam mahápaññánam, A.i.23). He was considered by the Buddha as inferior only to himself in wisdom. SA.ii.45; his greatest exhibition of wisdom followed the Buddha's descent from Távatimsa to the gates of Sankassa, when the Buddha asked questions of the assembled multitude, which none but Sáriputta could answer. But some questions were outside the range of any but a Buddha (DhA.iii.228 f.; cf. SNA.ii.570f.). Similarly knowledge of the thoughts and inclinations of people were beyond Sáriputta; only a Buddha possesses such knowledge (DhA.iii.426; J.i.182). Further, only a Buddha could find suitable subjects for meditation for everybody </data>
<data>without error (SNA.i.18), and read their past births without limitation (SNA, ii.571).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha would frequently merely suggest a topic, and Sáriputta would preach a sermon on it in detail, and thereby win the Buddha's approval. (See, e.g., M.i.13; iii.46, 55, 249). The Buddha is recorded as speaking high praise of him: &quot;Wise art thou, Sáriputta, comprehensive and manifold thy wisdom, joyous and swift, sharp and fastidious. Even as the eldest son of a Cakkavatti king turns the Wheel as his father hath turned it, so dost thou rightly turn the Wheel Supreme of the Dhamma, even as I have turned it.&quot; (S.i.191; cf. SN.vs.556 f., where the Buddha is asked by Sela, who is his general, and the Buddha replies that it is Sáriputta who turns the Wheel of the Law; also M.iii.29). He thus came to be called Dhammasenápati, just as Ananda was called Dhammabhandágárika. The Anupada Sutta is one long eulogy of Sáriputta by the Buddha. He is there held up as the supreme example of the perfect disciple, risen to mastery and perfection in noble virtue, noble concentration, noble perception, noble deliverance. M.iii.25ff. In the Mahágosinga Sutta Sáriputta expresses his view that that monk is beat who is master of his heart and is not mastered by it. The Buddha explains that Sáriputta was stating his own nature (M.i.215 f.). The Buddha did not, however, hesitate to blame Sáriputta when necessary   e.g., the occasion when some novices, becoming noisy, were sent away by the Buddha, whose motive Sáriputta misunderstood (M.i.459). And again, when Sáriputta did not look after Ráhula properly, making it necessary for Ráhula to spend the whole night in the Buddha's jakes (J.i.161f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Saccavibhanga Sutta (M.iii.248) he is compared to a mother teacher, while Moggallána is like a child's wet nurse; Sáriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallána trains in the highest good. In the </data>
<data>Pindapáta párisuddhi Sutta (M.iii.294f) the Buddha commends Sáriputta for the aloofness of his life and instructs him in the value of reflection. Other instances are given of the Buddha instructing and examining him on various topics   e.g., on bhútam (&quot;what has come to be&quot;) (S.ii.47f), on the five indriyas, (S.v.220f., 225f., 233f ) and on sotápatti. S.v.347; we find the Buddha also instructing him on the cultivation of tranquillity (A.i.65); on the destruction of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; (A.i.133); the reasons for failure and success in enterprises (A.ii.81f.); the four ways of acquiring personality (attabháva) (A.ii.159); the methods of exhortation (A.iii.198); the acquisition of joy that comes through seclusion (A.iii.207); the noble training for the layman (211f.); six things that bring spiritual progress to a monk (424f.); seven similar things (A.iv.30); the seven grounds for praising a monk (35); the things and persons a monk should revere (120f.); the eight attributes of a monk free from the cankers (223 f.); the nine persons who, although they die with an attached remainder for rebirth, are yet free from birth in hell among animals and among petas (379 f.); and the ten powers of a monk who has destroyed the cankers (A.v.174 f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also find instances of Sáriputta questioning his colleagues, or being questioned by them, on various topics. Thus he is questioned by Mahá Kotthita on kamma (S.ii.112 f.); and on yoniso manasikára (progressive discipline, S.iii.176 f.); on avijjá and vijjá (ibid., 172 f.); on the fetters of sense perception (S.iv.162 f.); on certain questions pronounced by the Buddha as indeterminate (ibid., 384 f.); on whether anything is left remaining after the passionless ending of the six spheres of contact (A.ii.161); and on the purpose for which monks lead the brahmacariya under the Buddha </data>
<data>(A.iv.382). The Mahávedalla Sutta (M.i.292 ff.) records a long discourse preached by Sáriputta to Mahá Kotthita. He is mentioned as questioning Mahá Kassapa on the terms átápí and ottápí (S.ii.195f.), and Anuruddha on sekha (S.v.174 f., 298f.). On another occasion, Anuruddha tells Sáriputta of his power of seeing the thousand fold world system, his unshaken energy, and his untroubled mindfulness. Sáriputta tells him that his deva sight is mere conceit, his claims to energy conceit, and his mindfulness just worrying, and exhorts him to abandon thoughts of them all. Anuruddha follows his advice and becomes an arahant. A.i.281f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallána asks Sáriputta regarding the &quot;undefiled&quot; (their conversation forms the Anangana Sutta, M.i.25 ff.), and, at the conclusion of the Gulissáni Sutta, inquires whether the states of consciousness mentioned in that sutta were incumbent only on monks from the wilds or also on those from the villages (M.i.472f.). Sáriputta questions Upavána regarding the bojjhangá (S.v.76), and is questioned by Ananda regarding sotápatti (S.v.346, 362) as regards the reason why some beings are set free in this very life while others are not (A.ii.167), and on the winning of perfect concentration (A.v.8, 320). Ananda also questions Sáriputta (A.iii.201f.) on the speedy knowledge of aptness in things (kusaladhammesu khippanisanti), and, again, on how a monk may learn new doctrines and retain old ones without confusion (A.iii.361). In both these cases Sáriputta asks Ananda to answer the questions himself, and, at the end of his discourse, praises him. The Rathaviníta Sutta (M.i.145 ff.) records a conversation between Sáriputta and Punna Mantáníputta, for whom he had the greatest respect, after hearing the Buddha's eulogy of him. Sáriputta had given instructions that he should be told as soon as Punna came to Sávatthi and took </data>
<data>the first opportunity of seeing him. Among others who held discussions with Sáriputta are mentioned Samiddhi (A.iv.385), Yamaka (S.iii.109f.), Candikáputta (A.iv.403), and Laludáyi (A.iv.414).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among laymen who had discussions with Sáriputta are Atula (DhA.iii.327), Nakulapitá (S.iii.2f.) and Dhánañjáni (M.ii.186); Sívalí (immediately after his birth; J.i.408), also the Paribbájakas, Jambukhádaka (S.iv.251f.), Sámandaka (S.iv.261 f.; A.v.120), and Pasúra (SNA.ii.538), and the female Paribbájakas Saccá, Lolá, Avavádaká and Patácárá (J.iii.1), and Kundalakesí (DhA.ii.223f.). He is also said to have visited the Paribbájakas in order to hold discussion with them (A.iv.378); see also S.iii.238f., where a Paribbájaka consults him on modes of eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The care of the Sangha and the protection of its members' integrity was Sáriputta's especial concern by virtue of his position as the Buddha's Chief Disciple. Thus we find him being sent with Moggallána to bring back the monks who had seceded with Devadatta. His admonitions to the monks sometimes made him unpopular   e.g., in the case of the Assaji Punaabbasuká, the Chabbaggiyá (who singled him out for special venom) and Kokálika (See Channa, who reviled both Sáriputta and Moggallána, DhA.ii.110 f.). When Channa declared his intention of committing suicide, Sáriputta attempted to dissuade him, but without success (S.iv.55ff.; see also the Channováda Sutta). Monks sought his advice in their difficulties. (See, e.g., S.iv.103, where a monk reports to him that a colleague has returned to the household life, and asks what he is to do about it). He was greatly perturbed by the dissensions of the monks of Kosambí, and consulted the Buddha, at length, as to what he could do about it (Vin.i.354).  He was meticulous about rules laid down by the Buddha. Thus a rule had been laid down that one monk could ordain only one </data>
<data>samanera, and when a boy was sent to him for ordination from a family which had been of great service to him, Sáriputta refused the request of the parents till the Buddha had rescinded the rule (Vin.i.83). Another rule forbade monks to eat garlic (lasuna), and when Sáriputta lay ill and knew he could be cured by garlic, even then he refused to eat them till permission was given by the Buddha for him to do so (Vin.ii.140). The Dhammapada Commentary (Vin.ii.140f) describes how, at the monastery in which Sáriputta lived, when the other monks had gone for alms, he made the round of the entire building, sweeping the un-swept places, filling empty vessels with water, arranging furniture, etc., lest heretics, coming to the monastery, should say: &quot;Behold the residences of Gotama's pupils.&quot; But even then he did not escape censure from his critics. A story is told (DhA.iv.184f) of how he was once charged with greed, and the Buddha himself had to explain to the monks that Sáriputta was blameless. While Sáriputta was severe in the case of those who failed to follow the Buddha's discipline, he did not hesitate to rejoice with his fellow monks in their successes. Thus we find him congratulating Moggallána on the joy he obtained from his iddhi powers, and praising his great attainments (praise which evoked equally generous counter praise), (S.ii.275 f ) and eulogising Anuruddha on his perfected discipline won through the practice of the four satipatthánas (S.v.301f). It was the great encouragement given by Sáriputta to Samitigutta (q.v.), when the latter lay ill with leprosy in the infirmary, which helped him to become an arahant. It was evidently the custom of Sáriputta to visit sick monks, as did the Buddha himself (ThagA.i.176). So great was Sáriputta’s desire to encourage and recognize merit in his colleagues that he once went about praising Devadatta's iddhi powers, which made it difficult for him when later he </data>
<data>had to proclaim, at the bidding of the Sangha, Devadatta's evil nature (Vin.ii.189).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several instances are given (E.g., S.ii.274; v.70; A.i.63; ii.160; iii.186, 190, 196, 200, 292, 340; iv.325, 328, 365; v.94, 102, 123, 315, 356f) of Sáriputta instructing the monks and preaching to them of his own accord on various topics -  apart from the preaching of the well known suttas assigned to him. Sometimes these suttas were supplementary to the Buddha's own discourses (E.g., M.i.13, 24, 184, 469). Among the most famous of Sáriputta's discourses are the Dasuttara and the Sangíti Suttas (q.v.). Though Sáriputta was friendly with all the eminent monks surrounding the Buddha, there was very special affection between him and Ananda and also Moggallána. We are told that this was because Amanda was the Buddha's special attendant, a duty which Sáriputta would have been glad to undertake For details of this see Mahá Moggallána, Ananda. Ananda himself had the highest regard and affection for Sáriputta. It is recorded in the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.63) that once, when the Buddha asked Ananda, &quot;Do you also, Ananda, approve of our Sáriputta?&quot; Amanda replied, &quot;Who, Sir, that is not childish or corrupt or stupid or of perverted mind, will not approve of him? Wise is he, his wisdom comprehensive and joyous and swift, sharp and fastidious. Small is he in his desires and contented; loving seclusion and detachment, of rampant energy. A preacher is he, accepting advice, a critic, a scourge of evil.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta was specially attached, also, to Ráhula, the Buddha's son, who was entrusted to Sáriputta for ordination. Mention is made of a special sutta in the Majjhima Nikáya, (the Mahá Ráhulováda Sutta; M.i.421f ) in which he urges Ráhula to practise the study of breathing. The special regard which Sáriputta had for the Buddha and Ráhula extended also to Ráhulamátá, for </data>
<data>we find that when she was suffering from flatulence. Ráhula consulted Sáriputta, who obtained for her some mango juice, a known remedy for the disease. (J.ii.392f) On another occasion (J.ii.433) he obtained from Pasenadi rice mixed with ghee and with red fish for flavouring when Ráhulamátá suffered from some stomach trouble. Among laymen Sáriputta had special regard for Anáthapindika; when the latter lay ill he sent for Sáriputta, who visited him with Ananda and preached to him the Anáthapindikováda Sutta. At the end of the discourse Anáthapindika said he had never before heard such a homily. Sáriputta said they were reserved for monks only, but Anáthapindika asked that they could be given to the laity and to young men of undimmed vision. Anáthapindika died soon after and was reborn in Tusita. M.iii.258 ff.; cf. S.v.380, which probably refers to an earlier illness of Anáthapindika. He recovered immediately after the preaching of Sáriputta's sermon, and served Sáriputta with rice from his own cooking pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta also, evidently, had great esteem for the householder Citta, for we are told (DhA.ii.74) that he once paid a special visit to Macchikásanda to see him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several incidents are related in the books showing the exemplary qualities possessed by Sáriputta   e.g., the stories of Tambadáthika, Punna and his wife, the poor woman in the Kundakakucchisindhava Játaka and Losaka Tissa (q.v.). These show his great compassion for the poor and his eagerness to help them. Reference has already been made to his first teacher, Sañjaya, whom he tried, but failed, to convert to the Buddha's faith. His second teacher was Assaji. It is said that every night on going to bed he would do obeisance to the quarter in which he knew Assaji to be and would sleep with his head in that direction. DhA.iv.150 f.; cf. SNA.i.328. If Assaji were in </data>
<data>the same vihára, Sáriputta would visit him immediately after visiting the Buddha. It was in connection with this that the Dhamma Sutta (q.v.) was preached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stories of the Sámaneras Sukha and Pandita, and of the monk Rádhá, also show his gratitude towards any who had shown him favour (See also Vin.i.55 f). His extreme affection for and gratitude to the Buddha are shown in the Sampasádaníya Sutta (q.v.). That Sáriputta possessed great patience is shown by the story (DhA.iv.146f) of the brahmin who, to test his patience, struck him as he entered the city for alms. But when he was wrongly accused and found it necessary to vindicate his good name, he did not hesitate to proclaim his innocence at great length and to declare his pre eminence in virtue. (See, e.g., his &quot;lion's roar&quot; at A.iv.373ff). Another characteristic of Sáriputta was his readiness to take instruction from others, however modest. Thus one story relates how, in absent mindedness, he let the fold of his robe hang down. A novice said, &quot;Sir, the robe should be draped around you,&quot; and Sáriputta agreed, saying, &quot;Good, you have done well to point it out to me,&quot; and going a little way, he draped the robe round him (ThagA.ii.116). A quaint story is told (Ud.iv.4) of a Yakkha who, going through the air at night, saw Sáriputta wrapt in meditation, his head newly shaved. The sight of the shining head was a great temptation to the Yakkha, and, in spite of his companion's warning, he dealt a blow on the Thera's head. The blow was said to have been hard enough to shatter a mountain, but Sáriputta suffered only a slight headache afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made of two occasions on which Sáriputta fell ill. Once he had fever and was cured by lotus stalks which Moggallána obtained for him from the Mandákiní Lake (Vin.i.214). On the other occasion he had </data>
<data>stomach trouble, which was again cured by Moggallána giving him garlic (lasuna), to eat which the rule regarding the use of garlic had to be rescinded by the Buddha (Vin.ii.140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta was fond of meal cakes (pitthakhajjaka), but finding that they tended to make him greedy he made a vow never to eat them (J.i.310).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta died some months before the Buddha. It is true that the account of the Buddha's death in the Mahá Parinibbána Sutta ignores all reference to Sáriputta, though it does introduce him (D.ii.81 ff ) shortly before as uttering his &quot;lion's roar&quot; (síhanáda), his great confession of faith in the Buddha, which, in the commentarial account, he made when he took leave of the Buddha to die. The Samyutta Nikáya (S.v.161) records that he died at Nálagámaka (the place of his birth), and gives an eulogy of him pronounced by the Buddha after his death (S.v.163f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no need to doubt the authenticity of this account. It merely states that when Sáriputta was at Nálagámaka he was afflicted with a sore disease. His brother, Cunda Samanuddesa, was attending on him when he died. His body was cremated, and Cunda took the relics to Sávatthi with Sáriputta's begging bowl and outer robe. The relics were wrapped in his water-strainer. Cunda first broke the news to Ananda, who confessed that when he heard it his mind was confused and his body felt as though drugged. Cf. Thag.vs.1034; see also the eulogy of Sáriputta by Vangísa during his lifetime (Thag.1231 3). Hiouen Thsang saw the stúpa erected over the relics of Sáriputta in the town of Kálapináka (Beal, op. cit., ii.177). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they sought the Buddha and told him of the event, and the Buddha pointed out to them the impermanence of all things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries give more details. The Buddha returned to </data>
<data>Sávatthi after his last vassa in Beluvagáma. Sáriputta sought him there, and, realizing that his death would come in seven days, he decided to visit his mother, for she, though the mother of seven arahants, had no faith in the Sangha. [This was because all her children joined the Order and left her desolate in spite of the forty crores of wealth which lay in the house. It is said (DhA.iv.164f.) that when Sáriputta had gone home on a previous occasion, she abused both him and his companions roundly. Ráhula was also in the company.] He therefore asked his brother, Cunda, to prepare for the journey to Nálagámaka with five hundred others, and then took leave of the Buddha after performing various miracles and declaring his faith in the Buddha and uttering his &quot;lion's roar.&quot; A large concourse followed him to the gates of Sávatthi, and there he addressed them and bade them stay behind. In seven days he reached Nálaka, where he wais met by his nephew, Uparevata, outside the gates. Him he sent on to warn his mother of his arrival with a large number of people. She, thinking that he had once more returned to the lay life, made all preparations to welcome him and his companions. Sáriputta took up his abode in the room in which he was born (játovaraka). There he was afflicted with dysentery. His mother, unaware of this and sulking because she found he was still a monk, remained in her room. The Four Regent Gods and Sakka and Mahá Brahmá waited upon him. She saw them, and having found out who they were, went to her son's room. There she asked him if he were really greater than all these deities, and, when he replied that it was so, she reflected on the greatness of her son and her whole body was suffused with joy. Sáriputta then preached to her, and she became a sotápanna. Feeling that he had paid his debt to his mother, he sent Cunda to fetch the monks, and, on their </data>
<data>arrival, he sat up with Cunda's help and asked if he had offended them in any way during the forty four years of his life as a monk. On receiving their assurance that he had been entirely blameless, he wiped his lips with his robe and lay down, and, after passing through various trances, died at break of dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother made all arrangements for the funeral, and Vissakamma assisted in the ceremony. When the cremation was over, Anuruddha extinguished the flames with perfumed water, and Cunda gathered together the relics. This account is summarized from SA.iii.172ff.; similar accounts are found at DA.ii.549f, etc. Sáriputta's death is also referred to at J.i.391.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who came to pay honour to the pyre was the goddess Revatí (q.v.). Sáriputta died on the full moon day of Kattika (October to November) preceding the Buddha's death, and Moggallána died a fortnight later. SA.iii.181; J.i.391; both Sáriputta and Moggallána were older than the Buddha because they were born &quot;anuppanne yeva hi Buddhe&quot; (DhA.i.73).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta had many pupils, some of whom have already been mentioned. Among others were Kosiya, Kandhadinna, Cullasárí, Vanavásika Tissa, Sankicca (q.v.), and Sarabhú, who brought to Ceylon the Buddha's collar bone, which he deposited in the Mahiyangana-cetiya (Mhv.i.37f). Sáriputta's brother, Upavána, predeceased him, and Sáriputta was with him when he died of snake bite at Sappasondikapabbára (S.iv.40f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta's special proficiency was in the Abhidhamma. It is said (DhSA.16f., DA.i.15, where it is said that at the end of the First Recital the Abhidhamma was given in charge of five hundred arahants, Sáriputta being already dead) that when preaching the Abhidhamma, to the gods of Távatimsa, the Buddha would visit Anotatta every day, leaving a nimitta Buddha, </data>
<data>on Sakka's throne to continue the preaching. After having bathed in the lake he would take his midday rest. During this time Sáriputta would visit him and learn from the Buddha all that had been preached of the Abhidhamma during the previous day. Having thus learnt the Abhidhamma, Sáriputta taught it to his five hundred pupils. Their acquirement of the seven books of the Abhidhamma coincided with the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon in Távatimsa. Thus the textual order of the Abhidhamma originated with Sáriputta, and the numerical series was determined by him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta is identified with various characters in numerous Játakas. Thus he was &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Canda-kumára in the Devadhamma, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Lakkhana in the Lakkhana, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the knight in the Bhojájáníya, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the monkey in the Tittira, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the snake in the Visavanta and Saccankira, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the tree sprite in the Sílavanága, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the brahmin youth in the Mahásupina, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the chief disciple in the Parosahassa, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Jhánasodhana and the Candábha, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the king of Benares in the Dummedha, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the good ascetic in the Godha (No.138) and the Romaka,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the charioteer of the king of Benares in the Rájováda,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the father-elephant in the Alínacitta, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the teacher in the Susíma, the Cúla Nandiya, the   Sílavímamsana and the Mahádhammapála, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the merchant in the Gijjha (No.164), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;a goose in the Catumatta, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the Nága king in the Jarudapána and the Sílavimamasa,  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the woodpecker in the Kurungamiga, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the thoroughbred in the Kundakakucchisindhava, </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sangárava&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very learned brahmin of Candalakappa. One day he saw Dhánañjání trip up, and heard her exclaim three times, &quot;Glory to the Buddha, the arahant, the all enlightened.&quot; He blamed her for thus extolling a shovelling monk, but when she told him of the Buddha’s marvellous qualities, he felt a desire to see him. Some time after, the Buddha went to Candalakappa and stayed in Todeyya’s Mango grove. When Dhánañjání told Sangárava that he was there, Sangárava visited him and questioned him on his views on brahmins. The Buddha said he had great regard for brahmins who had here and now won the goal, having discovered unaided a doctrine before unknown. He himself was one of these. He then proceeds to describe how he came to leave the household life and how, in due course, he won Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sangárava asks further whether there are any gods. The Buddha answers that of that there is no doubt; the whole world is in agreement on that point. Sangárava is pleased and accepts the Buddha as his teacher (M.ii.209ff). Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.808) that Sangárava was the youngest of the Bháradvájas (q.v.), brothers of Dhánañjání's husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta (S.i.182f) mentions a Sangárava who is perhaps distinct from the above. He lived in Sávatthi and was a &quot;bath ritualist,&quot; believing in purification by water, bathing morning and evening. The Buddha, at Ananda's request, visited his house and preached to him the Doctrine, after which he became the Buddha's follower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.i.207) explains that Ananda and Sangárava had, as laymen, been friends, and Ananda was anxious to prevent &quot;this wretch (varáko) who, for all our friendship has contracted wrong views, from becoming a hell filler; moreover he has a circle of friends, and hundreds may </data>
<data>follow if he is converted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Samyutta passage (S.v.121f.; see Sangárava Sutta, 3) contains a sutta in which the brahmin Sangárava visits the Buddha and asks him why he can remember certain mantras with great case and others not at all. It may be this same brahmin who is mentioned several times also in the Anguttara. A.i.168 f; iii.230f.; v. 232, 252. For details see Sangárava SuttA (4 7). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary states (AA.i.396) that he was an overseer in charge of the repair of the dilapidated buildings in Rájagaha (Rájagahanagare jinnapatisankhara nakárako áyuttakabráhmano).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sáriputta Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The sixteenth sutta of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipáta. Sáriputta asks the Buddha how a monk should conduct himself in order to achieve his goal. The Buddha explains that a monk must avoid the five dangers, endure heat and cold and other discomforts, and must not be guilty of theft, anger, lying or arrogance. He should be guided by wisdom and moderation (SN. 955 75). The Commentary explains (SNA.ii.569f ) that the sutta is also called the Therapañha Sutta, and that it was preached on the occasion of the Buddha's descent from Távatimsa to Sankassa. The Buddha desired that Sáriputta's wisdom should be adequately recognized, for Moggallána’s iddhi, Anuruddha’s clairvoyance and Punna's eloquence were already famous, but Sáriputta's skill remained unknown. The Buddha therefore related the Parosahassa Játaka in order to show Sáriputta's wisdom in a past life. At the end of the story, Sáriputta questioned the Buddha in eight stanzas, and the rest of the sutta was spoken by the Buddha in answer to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sáriputta Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha instructs Sáriputta on how to train oneself in order to get rid of notions of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine.&quot; The sutta contains a quotation from the Udayapañha. A.i.133.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sáriputta Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Sáriputta relates to Ananda how once, when he was in Andhavana, he attained to perfect concentration.

One day the Buddha preached for his special benefit, and, very much moved, he joined the Order. But because of his immaturity of knowledge, he continued some time without application. Later he was impressed by another sermon of the Buddha, and became devoted and intent, attaining arahantship soon afterwards (Thag.vs.90. ThagA.i.189).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Adhichattiya (or Chattádhichattiya) of the Apadána (Ap.i.170). In the past he erected a parasol over the cetiya of Atthadassí Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sáma Játaka (No. 540)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once two hunters, chiefs of villages, made a pact that if their children happened to be of different sexes, they should marry each other. One had a boy called Dukúlaka, because he was born in a wrapping of fine cloth; the other had a daughter called Páriká, because she was born beyond the river. When they grew up the parents married them, but, because they had both come from the Brahma world, they agreed not to consummate the marriage. With their parents' consent they became ascetics, and lived in a hermitage provided for them by Sakka on the banks of the Migasammatá. Sakka waited on them, and perceiving great danger in store for them, persuaded them to have a son. The conception took place by Dukúlaka touching Páriká's navel at the proper time. When the son was born they called him Sáma, and, because he was of golden colour, he came to be called Suvannasáma. He was the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, after Sáma was grown up, his parents, returning from collecting roots and fruits in the forest, took shelter under a tree on an anthill. The water which dripped from their bodies angered a snake living in the anthill, and his venomous breath blinded them both. When it grew late Sáma went in search of them and brought them home. From then onwards he looked after them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piliyakkha, king of Benares, while out hunting one day, leaving his mother in charge of the kingdom, saw Sáma drawing water, and, lest he should escape, shot at him with his arrow. The king took him for some supernatural being, seeing that the deer, quite fearless, drank of the water while Sáma was filling his jar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Piliyakkha heard who Sáma was and of how he was the mainstay of his parents, he was filled with grief. Sáma fell down fainting from </data>
<data>the poisoned arrow, and the king thought him dead. A goddess, Bahusodarí, who had been Sáma's mother seven births earlier, lived in Gandhamádana and kept constant watch over him. This day she had gone to an assembly of the gods and had forgotten him for a while, but she suddenly became aware of the danger into which he had fallen. She stood in the air near Piliyakkha, unseen by him, and ordered him to go and warn Sáma's parents. He did as he was commanded, and, having revealed his identity, gradually informed them of Sáma's fate and his own part in it. But neither Dukúlaka nor Páriká spoke to him one word of resentment. They merely asked to be taken to where Sáma's body lay. Arrived there, Páriká made a solemn Act of Truth (saccakiriyá), and the poison left Sáma's body, making him well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bahusodarí did likewise in Gandhamádana, and Sáma's parents regained their sight. Then Sáma preached to the marvelling king, telling him how even the gods took care of those who cherished their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a young man of Sávatthi. Having heard the Buddha preach, he obtained his parents' leave with great difficulty and joined the Order. Five years he lived in the monastery, and, failing to attain insight, he returned to the forest and strove for twelve years more. His parents grew old, and as there was no one to look after them, their retainers robbed them of their goods. Their son, hearing of this from a monk who visited him in the forest, at once left his hermitage and returned to Sávatthi. There he tended his parents, giving them food and clothing which he acquired by begging, often starving himself that they might eat. Other monks blamed him for supporting lay folk, and the matter was reported to the Buddha. But the Buddha, hearing his story, praised him and preached to him the Mátuposaka Sutta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Dukúlaka is identified with Kassapa, Páriká with Bhaddá Kápilání, Piliyakkha with Ananda, Sakka with Anuruddha, and Bahusodarí with Uppalavanná (J.vi.68 95; the story is referred to at Mil.198f.; J.iv.90, etc.; see also Mtu.ii.212 ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="salikedara_jat484')"&gt;Sálikedára Játaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached in reference to the same monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</data>

Asoka granted the request, and sent Sanghamittá, by sea, with eleven other nuns, carrying a branch of the Bodhi tree. On the way, when Nágas surrounded the Bodhi tree, Sanghamittá frightened them away by assuming the form of a Garuda. She landed at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambukola')"&gt;Jambukola&lt;/a&gt;, and, after her arrival at Anurádhapura, ordained Anulá and her companions.

Later, the king built for her the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthalhaka_vih')"&gt;Hatthálhaka vihára&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She died at the age of fifty nine, in the ninth year of the reign of King Uttiya, and celebrations, lasting one whole week, were held in </data>

The king of Benares went out hunting with his courtiers, who contrived to drive the stag near the king; he shut, the stag rolled over as hit, but soon got up and ran away. The courtiers laughed and the king set off in pursuit of the stag. During the chase he fell into it pit, and the stag, feeling pity for him, drew him out and taught him the Law. On the king's return, he decreed that all his subjects should observe the five virtues. The king told no one of what bad befallen him, but the chaplain, hearing him repeat six stanzas, divined what had happened. He questioned the king, who told him the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many men and women, following the king’s instructions, were reborn in heaven and Sakka, realizing the reason for this, appeared before the king, who was practising shooting, and contrived that he should proclaim the Bodhisatta’s nobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Sáriputta's wisdom. It is said that, when the Buddha descended from Távatimsa after preaching the Abhidhamma, wishing to demonstrate the unique wisdom of Sáriputta, he propounded certain questions before the multitude at Sankassa, which none but Sáriputta could answer. What the Buddha asked in brief Sáriputta answered in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with the king and Sáriputta with the chaplain (J.iv.263 75).

He is addressed as Aggivessana, that being his gotta name (the Agnivesyáyanas).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.450; cf. J.iii.1, where Sivávatiká is called Avavádaká) that both his parents were Niganthas, skilled debaters, who married at the suggestion of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi')"&gt;Licchavis&lt;/a&gt;, because they were unable to defeat each other in argument. The Licchavis provided for their maintenance.

These engaged in a discussion with &lt;a href="saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;, and were defeated by him. Having then entered the Order, they became arahants. Saccaka was their brother and was the youngest of them. He was a teacher of the Licchavis and lived at Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Saccaka was defeated by the Buddha as stated in the Cúla-Saccaka Sutta, one of the Licchavis, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dummukha')"&gt;Dummukha&lt;/a&gt;, compared him to a crab in a pool, its claws being smashed one after the other and unable to return to the pool. Saccaka, owned defeat, and begged the Buddha to take a meal at his house. The Buddha agreed, and Saccaka became his follower (M.i.234f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MA.i.469f) that, in a later birth, long after the Buddha's death, Saccaka was born in Ceylon as the Thera Kála Buddharakkhita and attained arahantship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccaka, is identified with Senaka of the </data>

The Buddha is staying at the Pávárika ambavana in Nálandá. Sáriputta worships him and declares that there has been, is, and will be, no one greater than the Buddha, or wiser, as regards sambodhi. He admits, in answer to the Buddha, that he knows nothing either of past Buddhas or of future ones, and that he is unable to comprehend the Buddha's mind with his own. But he knows the lineage of the Norm (Dhammanvaya), and is able to deduce therefore the qualities of past and future&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhas. He then proceeds to recount the qualities and attainments in which the Buddha is unsurpassed and unsurpassable. The Buddha agrees that Sáriputta’s statement are in agreement with the Dhamma. Mahá Udáyí, who is present, declares his amazement that the Buddha, though possessed of such marvellous qualities, should yet be so serene and resigned. The sutta ends with an exhortation by the Buddha that Sáriputta should often discourse on this topic to men and women that their doubts may be set at rest.

He once visited Nandaka Thera with Pekkhuniya's grandson, Rohana. See the Sálha Sutta (A.i.193 f). He built a vihára for the nuns and Sundaríndá was appointed to supervise the work. As a result, Sálha and Sundarínandá saw each other frequently and fell in love. Wishing to seduce her, Sálha invited a party of nuns to his house and set apart seats for those nuns who were older than Nandá in one part, and for those younger in another, so that Nandá would be alone. But she, guessing the reason for the invitation, did not go, and, instead, sent an attendant nun to Sálha's house for her alms, excusing herself on the plea that she was taken ill. Salha, hearing of this, set a servant to look after the other nuns and ran off to the monastery. Nandá, on her bed, was waiting for him, and he seduced her (Vin.iv.211f). Buddhaghosa explains (Sp.iv.900) that Sálha was called Migáranattá because he was the grandson of Migaramátá, (Visákhá).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sabbaka (Sappaka)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant Thera. He belonged to a brahmin family of Sávatthi, and, after hearing the Buddha preach, entered the Order. He lived in Lonagiri vihára (v.l. Lena vihára), on the banks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajakaranii')"&gt;Ajakaraní&lt;/a&gt;, practising meditation, and, in due course, won arahantship. He visited Sávatthi to worship the Buddha, and stayed there a few days, entertained by his kinsfolk. When he wished to return to his dwelling they begged him to stay and be supported by them, but he refused because he loved retirement. The verses he spoke on this occasion are given in Thag.vs.307 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty one kappas ago he was a Nága king of great power who, having seen the Pacceka Buddha Sambhavaka, wrapt in samádhi, under the open sky, remained beside him holding a lotus over his head (ThagA.i.399f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably to be identified with Padumapújaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.279 f ; cf. Ap.ii.453f. (Padumudháriya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the fields of the brahmin &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosiya')"&gt;Kosiyagotta&lt;/a&gt;, of Sálindiya in Magadha, were ripe, the parrot went there with his flock, and, having fed himself, took some corn for his parents. The watchman of the fields reported this to Kosiyagotta, and, on his instructions, a snare was set and the Bodhisatta caught. When he raised the alarm, the other parrots fled. The Bodhisatta explained to Kosiyagotta why he carried the corn away - to feed his parents, his young ones, and those who were in need, thus, as it were, paying a debt, giving a loan, and setting up a store of merit. The brahmin was very pleased, and gave permission to the Bodhisatta to take the corn of all his thousand acres; but the Bodhisatta accepted only eight (J. iv.276 82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the introductory story see the &lt;a href="sama_jat_540')"&gt;Sáma Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt;, is identified with the watchman and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; with Kosiyagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Samiddhi &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Samiddhi Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a householder's family of Rájagaha. From the time of his birth his family prospered, and he himself was happy and good, hence his name. He was present at the meeting between the Buddha and Bimbisára, and was so impressed thereby that he joined the Order. Once, while he was at the Tapodáráma musing on his good fortune as a monk, Mára tried to terrify him. Samiddhi told the Buddha of this, but the Buddha asked him to stay on where he was. He obeyed, and soon afterwards won arahantship. He then declared his aññá in a verse (Thag.vs.46), and Mára retired discomfited. This episode is also given at S.i.119 f, but the place mentioned is not the Tapodáráma, but Silávati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he met Siddhattha Buddha, to whom he gave some flowers with stalks, which he picked with the help of his bow and arrow. Fifty-one kappas ago he was a king named Jutindhara (ThagA.i.117f). He is probably identical with Salalamáliya of the Apadána (Ap.i.206).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Samiddhi was drying himself after bathing in the Tapodá, a Deva approached and questioned him on the Bhaddekaratta Sutta. Samiddhi confessed ignorance, and the Deva asked him to learn it from the Buddha. This he did from a brief sermon preached to him by the Buddha, which Mahá Kaccána later enlarged into the Mahá Kaccána-Bhaddekaratta Sutta (q.v.) (M.iii.192f). A conversation between Potaliputta and Samiddhi, three years after the latter had joined the Order, led to the preaching of the Mahákammavibhanga Sutta (q.v. ) (M.iii.207). In the sutta the Buddha speaks of Samiddhi as moghapurisa, and Samiddhi is also teased by Potaliputta for pretending to expound the Dhamma after being only three years in the Order. According to the </data>
<data>Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.799), Samiddhi was a pupil (saddhivihárika) of Sáriputta, and the Anguttara (A.iv.385f ) contains a record of a lesson given by Sáriputta to Samiddhi regarding sankappavitakkas.

The Kassapiyá were a branch of the same (Mhv.v.8f; Dpv.v.47). They held that everything is, exists, is constantly existing, because it is, was, or will be, matter and mind, and these continually exist (Kvu.i.6, 7); that penetration of truth is won little by little (Kvu.ii.9). They agreed with the Uttarápathakas that conscious flux may amount to samádhi (Kvu.xi.6), and with the Vajjiputtiyas that an arahant may fall away.

When he had finished his studies, the king offered him a province, but, at the suggestion of his teacher, he preferred to live near his father. There, acting on the Bodhisatta's advice, he won all hearts, and on the death of his father the courtiers made him king. The brothers protested, and Samvara, again following his teacher's advice, divided his father's wealth among them. Then his brothers, led by Uposatha, acknowledged him king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk who had dwelt in the forest and had then given up striving.

He was brought up with the king's son, and they studied together in Takkasilá, becoming great friends. When the prince succeeded to the throne, the Bodhisatta, not desiring to live a householder's life, became an ascetic and lived in the Himálaya. As time passed, the king began to think of him, and sent his minister, Sayha, to fetch the ascetic, that he might become the royal chaplain. But the Bodhisatta refused to come, saying that he had no need of such honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who, loving a woman, was discontented. The king is identified with Ananda, and Sayha with Sáriputta. J.iii.30 33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sakka&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost always spoken of as “devánam indo,&quot; chief (or king) of the devas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.229; DhA.i.264) contains a list of his names:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;he is called Maghavá, because as a human being, in a former birth, he was a brahmin named Magha. (But see Magha; cf. Sanskrit Maghavant as an epithet of Indra).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;As such he bestowed gifts from time to time, hence his name Purindada (Cf. Indra's epithet Purandara, destroyer of cities) (generous giver in former births or giver in towns).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Because he gives generously and thoroughly (sakkaccam) he is known as Sakka. Sakra occurs many times in the Vedas as an adjective, qualifying gods (chiefly Indra), and is explained as meaning “able, capable.&quot; It is, however, not found as a name in pre Buddhist times.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Because he gives away dwelling places (ávasatham) he is called Vásava (But see Vásava).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Because in one moment he can think of one thousand matters, he is called Sahassakkha (also Sahassanetta).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Because he married the Asura maiden Sujá, he is called Sujampati. For the romantic story of Sakka's marriage, see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaa')"&gt;Sujá&lt;/a&gt;. Thus Sujá's father, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vepacitti')"&gt;Vepacitti&lt;/a&gt;, became Sakka's father in law. Several quaint stories are related about father  and son in law. The two sometimes quarrelled and at others lived together in peace </data>
<data>(SA.i.265).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Because he governs the devas of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt; he is called Devánam Indo (See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/inda')"&gt;Inda&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Elsewhere (E.g., D.ii.270; M.i.252) Sakka is addressed as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosiya')"&gt;Kosiya&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;He is also spoken of as Yakkha. M.i.252; cf. S.i.206 (Sakkanámako Yakkho); at S.i.47 Mághadevaputta (Sakka) is called Vatrabhú, slayer of Vrtra (SA.i.83);  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Sakka is also, in the Játakas, called Gandhabbarája (J.vi.260) and Mahinda (J.v.397, 411).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka rules over &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt; devaloka, the lowest heaven but one of the lower plane. His palace is &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vejayanta')"&gt;Vejayanta&lt;/a&gt; and his chariot bears the same name. Though king of the Távatimsa devas, he is no absolute monarch. He is imagined rather in the likeness of a chieftain of a Kosala clan. The devas meet and deliberate in the Sudhammá sabhá and Sakka consults with them rather than issues them commands. On such occasions, the Four Regent Devas are present in the assembly with their followers of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Cátummahárájika&lt;/a&gt; world (See, e.g., D.ii.207f., 220f). Among the Távatimsa devas, Sakka is more or less primus inter pares, yet lie surpasses his companions in ten things: length of life, beauty, happiness, renown, power; and in the degree of his five sense experiences: sight, hearing, smelling, taste and touch. A.iv.242; these are also attributed to the rulers of the other deva worlds.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.228, 229, 231; cf. Mil. 90; for details of these see Magha) the Buddha gives seven rules of conduct, which rules Sakka carried out as a human being, thus attaining to his celestial sovereignty. When the devas fight the Asuras they do so under the banner and orders of Sakka. For details of Sakka's conquest of the Asuras see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura')"&gt;Asura&lt;/a&gt;. The Asuras called him Jara Sakka (J.i.202). Pajápati, Vamna and Isána are also mentioned as having been associated with him in supreme command (S.i.219).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikáya a whole Samyutta - one of the shortest, consisting of twenty five short suttas -  is devoted to Sakka. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the first and second suttas Sakka praises energy   (viriya); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in the third he denounces timidity; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in the fourth he shows forbearance to his enemy; (*16)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in the fifth lie advocates the conquest of anger by   kindness; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in the sixth kindness to animals; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in the seventh he denounces trickery, even towards   enemies; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;and in the ninth he preaches courtesy and honour   towards the wise. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the eleventh are described the seven life long   habits which raised him to his present eminent position;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;twelve and thirteen repeat this and explain his titles.  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the fourteenth Sakka explains how new gods, who   outshine the old ones, do so because they have observed the Buddha's teaching.  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In the fifteenth he describes as the most beautiful   spot that where arahants dwell; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in the sixteenth he praises gifts to the Order (*17);  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;in the seventeenth he praises the Buddha, but is told </data>
<data>  by Sahampati that he has selected the wrong attributes for praise.   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;In eighteen to twenty he says that whereas brahmins and   nobles on earth and the gods of the Cátummahárájika world and of Távatimsa   worship him, he himself worships good men and arahants. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Numbers twenty one, twenty two, twenty four and twenty   five are against anger, and twenty three is against deceit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;    &lt;p&gt;*16 The enemy, in this case, is his father-in law,     Vepacitta. Sakka had a reputation for great forbearance. In sutta 22 a     Yakkha is said to have come and to have sat on his throne, to anger him. But     Sakka showed him great honour and the Yakkha vanished. The Commentary adds     (S.A.i.272) that it was no Yakkha, but a Rúpávacara Brahmá, named     Kodhabhakkha, who had come to test Sakka's patience.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;*17 The story connected with this sutta is that of     Sakka, seeing the people of Anga and Magadha make preparations for a great     sacrifice to Mahá Brahmá, feels pity for them and comes among them in the     guise of Brahmá, advising them to take their offerings to the Buddha and     seek his counsel (SA.i.270).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These and other passages show that Sakka was considered by the early Buddhists as a god of high character, kindly and just, but not perfect, and not very intelligent. His imperfections are numerous: in spite of his very great age, (*18) he is still subject to death and rebirth (A.i.144); as an example of this, it is mentioned that Sunetta had thirty five times been reborn as Sakka (A.iv.105), a statement confirmed by the Buddha (A.iv.89). Sakka is not free from the three deadly evils -  lust, ill will, Stupidity (*22); nor is he free from anxiety. He is timid, given to </data>
<data>panic, to fright, to running away. (*23)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;    &lt;p&gt;*18 At J.ii.312, Sakka's life is given as lasting     thirty million and sixty times one hundred thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;*22 A.i.144. The story of Rohini shows that Sakka was     very susceptible to the charms of beauty. He evidently liked other people to     enjoy life and sent a heavenly dancer to amuse Mahápanáda when nobody on     earth could accomplish that feat (SNA.ii.400). On another occasion, as Sakka     was rejoicing in his triumph over the Asuras, he saw a crane on a hill top     who wished to be able to eat fish without going down into the stream. Sakka     immediately sent the stream in full flood, to the hill top (J.iii.252).&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;*23 He is mentioned in the Játakas as frightened of     ascetics who practised severe penances, lest they should unseat him from his     throne, e.g., J.ii.394; also the stories of Visayha, Lomasakassapa, Kanha,     Akitti, Mahá Kañcana and Isisinga.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sakkapañha Sutta (q.v.), Sakka is said to have visited the Buddha at Vediyagiri in Ambasandá and to have asked him a series of questions. He sends Pañcasikha with his viná to play and sing to the Buddha and to obtain permission for him (Sakka) to visit him and question him. It was Sakka who had given the Beluvapanduvíná to Pañcasikha (SNA.ii.394).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha says to himself that Sakka, for a long time past, has led a pure life, and gives him permission to question him on any subject. It is stated in the course of the sutta (D.ii.270) that it was not the first time that Sakka had approached the Buddha for the same purpose. He had gone to him at the Salaghara in Sávatthi, but found him in meditation, with Bhuñjatí, wife of Vessavana, waiting on him. He therefore left with a request to </data>
<data>Bhuñjatí to greet the Buddha in his name. He also declares (D.ii.286) that he has become a sotápanna and has earned for himself the right to be reborn eventually in the Akanitthá world, whence he will pass entirely away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says that Sakka was constantly seeing the Buddha and was the most zealous of the devas in the discharge of his duties to the sásana. DA.iii.697. In the sutta Sakka admits (D.ii.284) that he visited other brahmins and recluses as well. They were pleased to see him, and boasted that they had nothing to teach him; but he had to teach them what he knew. But this visit to the Buddha at Vediyagiri had a special object. Sakka saw sips that his life was drawing to an end and was frightened by this knowledge. He therefore went to the Buddha to seek his help. It adds (DA.iii.732; cp. DhA.iii.270) that, as Sakka sat listening to the Buddha, he died in his old life and was reborn a new and young Sakka; only Sakka himself and the Buddha was aware of what had happened. The Commentary continues (DA.iii.740) that Sakka became an &quot;uddham sota,&quot; treading the path of Anágámís. As such he will live in Avihá for one thousand kappas, in Atappa for two thousand, in Sudassaná for four thousand, and will end in the Akanittha world, after having enjoyed life in the Brahmaworlds for thirty one thousand kappas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An account of another interview which Sakka had with the Buddha is given in the Cúlatanhásankhaya Sutta (q.v.). There the question arises regarding the extirpation of cravings. Sakka accepts the Buddha's answer and leaves him. Anxious to discover whether Sakka has understood the Buddha's teaching, Moggallána visits Sakka and questions him. Sakka evades the questions and shows Moggallána the glories of his Vejayanta palace. Moggallána then frightens him by a display of iddhi-power, and Sakka repeats to him, word for </data>
<data>word, the Buddha's answer. Moggallána departs satisfied, and Sakka tells his handmaidens that Moggallána is a &quot;fellow of his&quot; in the higher life, meaning, probably, that he himself is a sotápanna and therefore a kinsman of the arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a passage in the Samyutta (S.i.201) Sakka is represented as descending from heaven to make an enquiry about Nibbána, and in another (S.iv.269f.), as listening, in heaven, to Moggallána’s exposition of the simplest duties of a good layman. On another occasion, at Vessavana's suggestion, Sakka visited Uttara Thera on the Sankheyyaka Mountain and listened to a sermon by him (A.iv.163f.). See also Sakka Sutta (2) and (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The later books contain a good deal of additional information regarding Sakka. His city extends for one thousand leagues, and its golden streets are sixty leagues long; his palace Vejayanta is one thousand leagues high; the Sudhammá hall covers five hundred leagues, his throne of yellow marble (Pandukambalasilásana) is sixty leagues in extent, his white umbrella with its golden wreath is five leagues in circumference, and he himself is accompanied by a glorious array of twenty five million nymphs (J.v.386). Other features of his heaven are the Páricchattaka tree, the Nandá pokkharaní and the Cittalatávana (DA.iii.716; See also Távatimsa). His body is three gavutas in height (DhA.iii.269); his chief conveyance is the marvellous elephant Erávana (q.v.), but he goes to war in the Velayanta ratha (q.v.). Reference is often made to his throne, the Pandukambalasilásana (q.v.), composed of yellow stone. It grows hot when Sakka's life draws towards its end; or his merit is exhausted; or when some mighty being prays; or, again, through the efficacy of virtue in recluses or brahmins or other beings, full of potency. J.iv.8; when the Buddha, however, sat on it, he was able to conceal it in his robe </data>
<data>(DhA.iii.218).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka's devotion to the Buddha and his religion is proverbial. When the Bodhisatta cut off his hair and threw it into the sky, Sakka took it and deposited it in the Cúlámani cetiya (J.i.65). He was present near the Bodhi tree, blowing his Vijayuttara sankha (q.v.), when Mára arrived to prevent the Buddha from reaching Enlightenment (J.i.72). When the Buddha accepted Bimbisára's invitation to dine in his palace, Sakka, in the guise of a young man, preceded the Buddha and his monks along the street to the palace, singing the Buddha's praises (Vin.i.38). When the Buddha performed his Yamaka pátiháríya at the foot of the Gandamba, it was Sakka who built for him a pavilion, and gave orders to the gods of the Wind and the Sun to uproot the pavilions of the heretics and cause them great discomfort (DhA.iii.206, 208). When the Buddha returned to Sankassa from Távatimsa, whither he went after performing the Twin Miracle, Sakka created three ladders -  of gold, of silver, and of jewels respectively -  for the Buddha and his retinue (DhA.iii.225).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka was present at Vesáli when the Buddha visited that city in order to rid it of its plagues. His presence drove away the evil spirits, and the Buddha's task was thus made easier (DhA.iii.441). When the Buddha and his monks wished to journey one hundred leagues, to visit Culla Subhaddá at Uggapura, Sakka, with the aid of Vissakamma, provided them with pavilions (kútágára) in which they might travel by air (DhA.iii.470). Once, when the ponds in Jetavana were quite dry, the Buddha wished to bathe and Sakka immediately caused rain to fall and the ponds were filled (J.i.330). In Sakka's aspect as Vajirapáni (q.v.) he protected the Buddha from the insults of those who came to question him. See also the story of Ciñcá mánaviká, when Sakka protected the Buddha from her charges. Sakka also regarded it as his business to </data>
<data>protect the Buddha's followers, as is shown by the manner in which he came to the rescue of the four seven year old novices -  Sankicca, Pandita, Sopáka and Revata -  when they were made to go hungry by a brahmin and his wife (DhA.iv.176f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Buddha's last illness, Sakka ministered to him, performing the most menial tasks, such as carrying the vessel of excrement. DhA.iv.269f. He did the same for other holy men -  e.g., Sáriputta. Sakka also waited on the Buddha when he was in Gayásísa for the conversion of the Tebhátikajatilas (Vin.i.28f.); see also the story of Jambuka (DhA.ii.59). The Udána (iii.7) contains a story of Sakka assuming the guise of a poor weaver and Sujá that of his wife, in order to give alms to Mahá Kassapa who had just risen from a trance. They succeeded in their ruse, to the great joy of Sakka (cp. DhA.i.424f). On other occasions - e.g., in the case of Maháduggata   Sakka helped poor men to gain merit by providing them with the means for giving alms to the Buddha (DhA.ii.135ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was present at the Buddha's death, and uttered, in verse, a simple lament, very different from the studied verses ascribed to Brahmá. (D.ii.157; on the importance of this verse, however, see Dial.ii.176, n.1). At the distribution, by Dona, of the Buddha's relics, Sakka saw Dona hide the Buddha's right tooth in his turban. Realizing that Dona was incapable of rendering adequate honour to the relic, Sakka took the relic and deposited it in the Cúlámanicetiya (DA.ii.609). And when Ajátasattu was making arrangements to deposit his share of the relics, Sakka gave orders to Vissakamma to set up a válasanghátayanta for their protection (DA.ii.613).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka did all in his power to help followers of the Buddha in their strivings for the attainment of the goal, as in the case of Panditasámanera, when he sent the Four Regent Gods to drive away the birds, made </data>
<data>the Moon deity shroud the moon, and himself stood guard at the door of Pandita's cell, lest he should be disturbed. (DhA.ii.143; cf. the story of Sukha DhA.iii.96f.). Often, when a monk achieved his ambition, Sakka was there to express his joy and do him honour. See, e.g., the story of Maháphussa (SNA.i.55f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was ready to help, not only monks and nuns, but also eminent laymen, such as Jotika for whom he built a palace of wondrous splendour, and provided it with every luxury (DhA.iv. 207f). Sakka was always ready to come to the rescue of the good when in distress -  e.g., in the case of Cakkhupála when he became blind; Sakka led him by the hand and took him to Sávatthi. DhA.i.14f. Many instances are found in the Játaka where Sakka rescued the good in distress -  e.g., Dhammaddhaja, Guttila, Kaccáni, the Kinnarí Candá, Sambulá, Kusa, Mahájanaka's mother, Candakumára's mother, Candá, and Mahosadha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He loved to test the goodness of men, as in the case of the leper Suppabuddha, to see if their faith was genuine. DhA.ii.34f.; see also the story of the courtesan in the Kurudhamma Játaka (J.ii.380).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka contains several stories of his helping holy men by providing them with hermitages, etc. -  e.g., Kuddála pandita, Hatthipála, Ayoghara, Jotipála (Sarabhanga), Sutasoma, Dukúlaka, Páriká and Vessantara. Sometimes, when he found that ascetics were not diligently practising their duties, he would frighten them -  e.g., in the Vighása and Somadatta Játakas. The Anguttara Nikáya (iii.370f ) contains a story of Sakka punishing a deva called Supatittha, who lived in a banyan tree, because he failed to keep the rukkhadhamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka appears as the guardian of moral law in the world. When wickedness is rampant among men, or kings become unrighteous, he appears among them to frighten them so that they may do good instead evil. He is on the </data>
<data>side of the good against the wicked, and often helps them to realize their goal. Instances of this are seen in the Ambacora, Ayakúta, Udaya, Kaccáni, Káma, Kámaníta, Kumbha, Kelisíla, Kharaputta, Culladhanuggaha, Dhajavihetha, Bilárikosiya, Manícora, Mahákanha, Vaka, Sarabhanga, Sarabhamiga and Sudhábhojana Játakas. Sakka patronised good men; some of the more eminent he invited to his heaven, sending his charioteer Matali to fetch them, and he showed them all honour -  e.g., Guttila, Mandhátá, Sádhina, and Nimi; others he rewarded suitably -  see, e.g., the Uraga Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesser gods consulted Sakka in their difficulties and problems e.g., in the case of the deity of Anáthapindika’s fourth gateway, who incurred the displeasure of Anáthapindika by advising him to refrain from too much generosity towards the Buddha and his monks (J.i.229). Sakka has also to deal with disputes arising among the devas themselves (DA.iii.705). On several occasions Sakka helped the Bodhisatta in the practice of his Perfections   e.g., as King Sivi, Temiya, Nimi and Vessantara, also in his birth as a hare; in this last story, the Sasa Játaka (q.v.), Sakka paints the picture of a hare in the moon to commemorate the Bodhisatta's sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka sometimes answers the prayers of good and barren women and gives them sons -  e.g., Sumedhá, Sílavatí, Candádeví. Mention is also made of other boons granted by Sakka to various persons. Thus in the Mahásuka Játaka he visited the parrot who clung to the dead stump of a tree through gratitude, and granted him the boon that the tree should once more become fruitful (J.iii.493). He granted four boons to Kanha, that he might be calm, bear no malice or hatred against his neighbour, feel no greed for others' glory, and no lust towards his neighbour (J.iv.10). To Akitti he granted several boons, the last of which was that he should have no </data>
<data>more visits from Sakka! (J.iv.240f). When Sivi became blind, Sakka gave him two eyes; these were not natural eyes, but the eyes of Truth, Absolute and Perfect (saccapáramitá cakkhuní). Sakka confesses that he has not the power of restoring sight; it was the virtue of Sivi himself which had that power (J.iv.410f). When Sílavatí wished for a boon, Sakka, took her to heaven, where he kept her for seven days; then he granted that she should have two sons, one wise and ugly and the other a fool and handsome. He also presented her with a piece of kusa grass, a heavenly robe, a piece of sandalwood, the flower of the Páricchattaka tree and a Kokanda lute. All this passed into the possession of Kusa, and, later, Sakka gave him the Verocana jewel (J.v.280f., 310). He gave Phusatí, mother of Vessantara, ten boons (J.vi.481f) and to Vessantara himself he gave eight (J.vi.572).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sarabhanga Játaka (J.v.392) mention is made of four daughters of Sakka -  Ásá, Saddhá, Hirí and Sirí. His wife, Sujá, accompanied him everywhere on his travels (E.g., J.iii.491), even into the world of men, because that was the boon she had asked for on her marriage to him (DhA.i.279). Vessavana was Sakka's special friend (MA.i.476f), and when one Vessavana died, it was Sakka's duty to appoint a successor (J.i.328). Matáli (q.v.) is Sakka's charioteer and constant companion. Vissakamma (q.v.) is his &quot;handy man.&quot; Sakka has twenty five million handmaids and five hundred dove-footed nymphs (kakutapádiniyo), famed for their beauty. It was the sight of these which tempted the Buddha's step brother, Nanda, to give up thoughts of Janapadakalyání Nandá (J.ii.93). Sakka's special weapon is the Vajirávudha and his special drum the Álambara (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His voice is sweet, like the tintinnabulation of golden bells (SA.i.273).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is Sakka's special duty to protect the religion of the </data>
<data>Buddha in Ceylon. As the Buddha lay dying, he enjoined on Sakka the task of looking after Vijaya and his successors. This duty Sakka, in turn, entrusted to the god Uppalavanna (Mhv.vii.1ff). Sakka informed Mahinda of the right moment for his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xiii.15). When Devánampiyatissa wished for relics to place in the Thúpáráma Thúpa, Sumana sámanera visited Sakka and obtained from him the right collar bone of the Buddha, which Sakka had placed in the Culámani cetiya (Mhv.xvii.9ff). Again, when Dutthagámaní was in need of building materials for the Mahá Thúpa, it was Sakka who supplied them (Mhv.xxviii.6ff). On the occasion of the enshrining of the relics in the Mahá Thúpa, Sakka gave orders to Vissakamma to decorate the whole of Ceylon. He also provided the throne and casket of gold for the relics brought from the Nágá world by Sonuttara and was himself present at the festival, blowing his conch shell. (Mhv.xxxi.34, 75, 78)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Cakkaválas have also their Sakka (aññehi Cakkaválehi Sakká ágacchanti; J.i.203.), and in one place (J.i.204) mention is made of many thousands of Sakkas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is evident from the foregoing account that, as Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.ii.297f), Sakka and Indra are independent conceptions. None of the personal characteristics of Sakka resemble those of Indra. Some epithets are identical but are evidently borrowed, though they are differently explained. The conception of the popular god which appealed to a more barbarous age and to the clans fighting their way into a new country, seems to have been softened and refined in order to meet the ideals of a more cultured and peaceful civilization. The old name no longer fitted the new god, and, as time went on, Sakka came to be regarded as an entirely separate god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sakka. &lt;/b&gt;A Yakkha. See Sakka Sutta (1).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sakka. &lt;/b&gt;Another form of Sákya (q.v.). E.g., A.iv.195; v.334.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sakka Samyutta. &lt;/b&gt;The eleventh section of the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.216 42). It contains twenty five short discourses connected with Sakka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Sakka Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A Yakkha visits the Buddha at Gijjhakúta and tells him that he should not spend his time teaching others. The Buddha answers that he does it out of sympathy and compassion (S.i.206).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds (SA.i.232) that this Sakka was a Yakkha belonging to Mára's faction. (Márapakkhiko).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sakka Sutta. &lt;/b&gt; Sakka, king of the devas, visits the Buddha at Gíjjhakúta and asks him why only some beings are fully set free in this life. Because of grasping, answers the Buddha. S.iv.101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sakka Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;A series of four conversations which Sakka and his retinue had with Moggallána, at Jetavana, on various simple topics, such as taking refuge in the Buddha, having unwavering faith in him, etc. S.iv.269ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Savittha Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Anguttara (A.i.118f) he is represented as saying, in the course of a conversation between him, Sáriputta and Kotthita, that he preferred the person who obtains relief by faith (saddhá), to one who testifies to the truth with the body or one who has won view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (AA.i.353) explains that Savittha himself won arahantship through faith, and that therefore he praises faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta (S.ii.115) contains two conversations of Savittha, both of which took place at the Ghositáráma in Kosambí. The first is with Musíla and deals with the paticcasamuppáda. Musíla, in answer to Savittha's questions, says that he has realized the truth of the paticcasamuppáda as his very own. &quot;Then you are an arahant,&quot; says Savittha, and Musíla remains silent. In the other conversation, Nárada, present at the discussion, in the company of Ananda, requests that the same questions be put to him. This Savittha does, and he tells Savittha that he has realized the truth of the Paticcasamuppáda by right insight and that, yet, he is not an arahant. He is like a man who sees a well containing water, but who has neither rope nor vessel. &quot;Now, what will you say of Nárada?&quot; asks Ananda. &quot;Nothing that is not lovely and good,&quot; answers Savittha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One hundred thousand kappas ago he offered a satti flower to the body of the Buddha (? Padumuttara) when it was being taken for cremation (Ap.ii.406). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Vimala Thera. ThagA.i.377.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There was a fowler who enticed quails by imitating their cry and then throwing a net over them. The Bodhisatta suggested that when the fowler did this, they should all fly away with the net. This they did, and, day after day, the fowler returned empty handed till his wife grew angry. One day, two of the quails started quarrelling, and the Bodhisatta, hearing their wrangling, decided to go elsewhere with his following. When the fowler came again and spread his net, the two quails started quarrelling, and he was able to capture them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was one of the, stories related at the time of the quarrel (Cumbatakalaha) between the Sákyans and the Koliyans (J.i.208 10). See also the introductory story of the Kunála Játaka. Elsewhere the story is called the Vattaka Játaka. E.g., J.v.414.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He preached the Law once a fortnight, on fast days, and large numbers of people, including the king, went to hear him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An old brahmin, begging for alms, was given one thousand pieces. He gave these to another brahmin to take care of, but the latter spent them, and when the owner came to ask for them, he gave his young daughter as wife, instead of the pieces. This girl had a lover, and, in order to be able to see him, she asked her husband to go begging for a maid to help her in the house. She filled a bag of provisions for the journey. On his way home, having earned seven hundred pieces, the brahmin opened his bag, and after having eaten some of the food, went to a stream to drink, leaving the bag open. A snake crept into the bag and lay there. A tree sprite, thinking to warn the brahmin, said, &quot;If you stop on the way you will die, if you return home your wife will die,&quot; and then disappeared. Much alarmed, the brahmin went towards Benares, weeping along the way, and, as it was the fast day, people going to hear Senaka, directed the brahmin to him. Senaka, hearing the brahmin's story, guessed the truth, and had the bag opened in front of the people. The snake crept out and was seized. To show his gratitude, the brahmin gave Senaka his seven hundred pieces, but Senaka gave them back with another three hundred, warning the brahmin not to take the money home. He buried the money under a tree, but could not keep the secret from his wife. She told her lover, and the money was stolen. The brahmin again sought Senaka, who told him of a plan for discovering the lover, and when he was found, Senaka sent for him and made him confess his guilt.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Buddha's wisdom. Ananda, was the brahmin and Sáriputta the tree sprite (J.iii.341 51). The story is often referred to as exemplifying the Buddha's practice of the Perfection of paññá. E.g., J.i.46; BuA.50f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Satullapakáyiká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of Devas. The Samyutta contains (S.i.16 22) a whole group of suttas in which these devas are stated to have visited the Buddha, asking him several questions on different topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.43f ) that, in a previous birth, they were a ship's crew on a trading line. Their vessel was overwhelmed by stormy seas, and sank with all on board. During the storm, the terrified crew saw one of their number seated like a yogi, calm and self possessed. On being asked what he thought of, he said he thought of the good deeds he had done before starting on the voyage. These would ensure him happy rebirth, so why should he worry? The others then implored his assistance and compassion. He divided them into seven groups of one hundred each, and shouted to them, above the tempest, the Five Precepts, assuring them that their síla would bring them to a happy dawn. They took the precepts as the waters rose, and were reborn in Sakka's heaven, in different groups, each with his own vimána. Their teacher had a golden vimána of one hundred leagues in the middle of the others. As soon as born they realized the reason for their happiness, and visited the Buddha in order to praise their wonderful teacher. They were called Satullapá because they shouted the precepts while divided in groups of one hundred (sata ullapá).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sañjaya Belatthiputta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the six famous heretical teachers of the Buddha's day. He was a great skeptic, his teaching being the evasion of problems and the suspension of judgment. His doctrines seem to have been identical with those of the Amarávikkhepikas (Eel wrigglers) who, when asked a question, would equivocate and wriggle like an eel. Sañjaya's teachings are given at D.i.58; cf. the &quot;Eel wrigglers&quot; at D.i.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is probable that Sañjaya suspended his judgments only with regard to those questions the answers to which must always remain a matter of speculation. It may be that he wished to impress on his followers the fact that the final answer to these questions lay beyond the domain of speculation, and that he wished to divert their attention from fruitless enquiry and direct it towards the preservation of mental equanimity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa gives us no particulars about Sañjaya, beyond the fact that he was the son of Belattha (DA.i.144). Sanskrit texts call him Sañjayí Vairatiputra (E.g., Mtu.iii.59f) and Sañjayi Vairattíputra (E.g., Dvy. 143,145).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Sañjaya the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paribbajaka')"&gt;Paribbájaka&lt;/a&gt; who was the original teacher of &lt;a href="saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.39). It is said that when these two disciples left Sañjaya to become pupils of the Buddha, they were joined by two hundred and fifty others. Sañjaya then fainted, and hot blood issued from his mouth. Vin.i.42; according to DhA.i.78, Sáriputta and Moggallána tried to persuade Sañjaya to accept the Buddha's doctrine, but they failed, and only one half of his disciples joined them. The Paribbájaka </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppiya')"&gt;Suppiya&lt;/a&gt; was also a follower of Sañjaya (DA.i.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barua thinks (Op. cit., 326) that the Aviruddhakas mentioned in the Anguttara (A.iii.276) were also followers of Sañjaya -  that they were called Amarávikkhepaká for their philosophical doctrines, and Aviruddhaká for their moral conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A certain brahmin had four daughters who were wooed by four suitors   one handsome, another advanced in years, another of noble family, and the last virtuous. Unable to decide between them, the brahmin sought the teacher's advice and gave all his four daughters to the virtuous man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a brahmin of Sávatthi who consulted the Buddha in a similar case. The two brahmins were identical. J.i.137f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Samacitta(pariyáya) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large number of Devas of Tranquil Mind (Samacittá) come to the Buddha at Jetavana and ask him if he will visit Sáriputta, who is preaching at the Migáramátupásáda on the person who is fettered both inwardly and outwardly. The Buddha agrees in silence and appears at the Migáramátupásáda. Sáriputta greets the Buddha and salutes him. The Buddha relates to him the visit of the Devas and tells him that a large number of them can stand in a space not greater than the point of a gimlet, and that, too, without crowding each other. This is because they have trained themselves to be tranquil in the senses and in the mind. Such tranquillity leads to tranquillity also of body, speech, and thought. Followers of other schools do not know this teaching (A.i.64f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the discourse of Sáriputta, (A.i.62f) referred to by the Devas, the Elder explains that the monk who keeps the Pátimokkha restraints is proficient in the practice of right conduct, seeing danger in the slightest faults such a one is reborn among the Devas and is therefore a &quot;Returner.&quot; Thus he is fettered inwardly to the self. Others there are who are born in Deva worlds and there become anágámís. These are fettered outwardly. Yet others are proficient in revulsion, in the ending of sensuality, of any existence and become anágámís.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (AA.i.320; cf. SNA., p.174; Mil. p.20) that at the conclusion of this sutta, as at the conclusion of the Mahásamaya, Mangala, and Cúla Ráhulováda Suttas, one hundred thousand crores attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was preached by Mahinda on the evening of his arrival in Ceylon. After his interview with Devánampiyatissa, Mahinda asked Sumana sámanera to announce the preaching of the Dhamma. This announcement was </data>
<data>heard throughout the Island, and gradually the news of it spread to Brahmá's heaven. There was then an assembly of Devas, just as on the occasion of Sáriputta's preaching of the sutta. Mhv.xiv.34ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sappadása Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in Kapilavatthu as the son of Suddhodana's chaplain. He received faith on the occasion of the Buddha's visit to his own people, and entered the Order. Overmastered by corrupt habits of mind and character, for twenty five years he was unable to develop concentration. This so distressed him that he was about to commit suicide, when, inward vision suddenly expanding, he attained arahantship (Thag. vs. 405 10. ThagA.i.448f). According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.256f), he tried to kill himself by making a snake, caught by the monks, bite him. But the snake refused to bite, in spite of all efforts to provoke him. Sappadása then threw it away, thinking it to be non poisonous. But the other monks declared it was a cobra, because they had seen its hood and heard its hissing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sappadása acted as barber to the monastery, and, one day, taking a razor, he applied it to his windpipe as he leaned against a tree. And then he thought how blameless his life had been and was filled with joy. Thereupon he developed insight and became an arahant. When the monks reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha said that the snake had been the Elder's slave in his third previous life, and therefore did not dare bite him. This incident gave the monk his name, Sappadása.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sátimattiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family of Magadha and, after entering the Order, lived in the forest and developed the six fold abhiññá. Thereupon he instructed monks and preached to large numbers of lay people. One family in particular he converted to the Faith, and in that family he was waited on respectfully by a beautiful girl. Mára, wishing to disgrace him, once went to the house disguised as the Elder, and grasped the girl's hand. But she, feeling that the touch was not human, took her hand away. The others, however, saw this and lost faith in the Thera. He, all unconscious, was aware next day of their changed manner. Discerning the work of Mára, he made them tell him what had happened. The father begged his forgiveness, and said that henceforth he himself would wait on the Elder (ThagA.i.368 f.; verses ascribed to him are found in Thag.246 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thera is evidently identical with Sumanatálavantiya of the Apadána (Ap.ii.408). Ninety four kappas ago he met Siddhattha Buddha and offered him a palmyra fan (tálavanta) covered with sumana flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sankicca &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Sankicca Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in a very eminent brahmin family of Sávatthi. His mother died just before his birth and was cremated, but he was found unburnt on the funeral pyre (Cf. the story of Dabba). The men who burnt his mother's body, turning the pyre over with sticks, pierced the womb and injured the pupil of the child's eye. Hence his name (Sankuná chinnakkhikotitáya = Sankicco). When he was discovered, they consulted soothsayers, who told them that if he lived in the household seven generations would be impoverished, but if he became a monk he would be the leader of five hundred. At the age of seven he came to know of his mother's death and expressed a wish to join the Order. His guardians agreeing to this, he was ordained under Sáriputta. He won arahantship in the Tonsure hall (ThagA.i.533).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time, thirty men of Sávatthi, who had entered the Order and had practised the duties of higher ordination for four years, wished to engage in meditation. The Buddha, foreseeing danger for them, sent them to Sáriputta. Sáriputta advised them to take with them the novice Sankicca, and they reluctantly agreed. After a journey of one hundred and twenty leagues, they came to a village of one thousand families, where they stayed at the request of the inhabitants, who provided all their needs. At the beginning of the rains, the monks agreed among themselves not to talk to one another; if any among them fell ill, he was to strike a bell. One day, as the monks were eating their meal on the banks of a neighbouring river, a poor man who had travelled far stood near them and they gave him some food. He then decided to stay with them, but after two months, wishing to see his daughter, he left the monks without a word. </data>
<data>He travelled through a forest where lived five hundred robbers, who had vowed to offer a human sacrifice to a spirit of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as they saw him, they captured him and prepared for the sacrifice. The man then offered to provide them with a victim of far higher status than himself, and led them to the monks. Knowing their habits, he struck the bell and they all assembled. When the robbers made known their design, each one of the monks offered himself as a victim, and in the end Sankicca, with  great difficulty, persuaded the others to let him go. The thieves took Sankicca, and, when all was ready, the leader approached him with drawn sword. Sankicca entered into samádhi, and when the blow was struck, the sword buckled and bent at the end and split from hilt to top. Marvelling at this, the thieves did obeisance to Sankicca, and, after listening to his preaching, asked leave to be ordained. Sankicca agreed to this, and, having ordained them, took them to the other monks. There he took leave of them and went with his following to the Buddha. In due course, Sankicca received the higher ordination, and ten years later he ordained his sister's son, Atimuttaka (Adhimuttaka), who, likewise, ordained five hundred thieves. DhA.ii.240ff.; for the story of Atimuttaka see Sankicca’s story is often referred to -  e.g., Vsm.313; J.vi.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagapeta_v')"&gt;Nágapeta Vatthu&lt;/a&gt; contains a story of another of Sankicca's pupils (PvA.53ff). The Theragáthá (Thag. vs. 597-607) contains a series of stanzas spoken by Sankicca in praise of the charms of the forest in reply to a layman who, wishing to wait upon him, wished him to dwell in the village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sankicca is one of the four novices mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/catusaamanera_va')"&gt;Catusámanera Vatthu&lt;/a&gt;. Sankicca's iddhi is described as ñávavipphára iddhi. </data>
<data>(Ps.ii.211; BuA.24). The iddhi referred to in this connection is Sankicca's escape from death while his mother's body was being burnt. Vsm., p.379.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sankicca. &lt;/b&gt;See Kisa Sankicca, where Sankicca is given as a gotta-name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;. Sankicca. &lt;/b&gt;The Bodhisatta, born as an ascetic.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sangámaji Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of a very rich setthi of Benares. When he came of age, his parents married him and he had a son. One day he joined a party of people going to Jetavana, and, at the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon, asked the Buddha to ordain him. But the Buddha wished him to have his parent's leave. This he obtained only with the greatest difficulty and with the promise to visit them later. After ordination he lived in a forest grove, and soon afterwards attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he returned to Sávatthi, after having paid homage to the Buddha, he spent the noonday under a tree. His parents, hearing of his arrival, went to see him. Their efforts to persuade him to return to lay life were too insistent, and he would not even speak to them. They returned discomfited and sent his wife and son to him. His wife appealed to him with various arguments, but he refused even to look at her. She then placed the child on his lap and went away. When she discovered that Sangámaji would not even talk to his son, she took him away, saying that her husband was a useless man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha saw all this with his divine eye and expressed his joy in verse. Ud.i.8; UdA.71ff.; the verse is quoted at Netti, p.150.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posiya Thera was Sangámaji's younger brother. ThagA.i.97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Sambulá was very beautiful, but when Sotthisena, being seized with leprosy, left his kingdom and went into the forest, she went with him and tended him with great devotion. One day, after fetching food from the forest, she went to bathe, and was drying herself, when she was seized by a Yakkha who threatened to carry her away.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By her power Sakka's throne was heated, and Sakka, coming with his thunderbolt, frightened the Yakkha and put him in chains. It was late when Sambulá returned home, and Sotthisena, wishing to test her love, refused to believe her story.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She then performed an Act of Truth, declaring that she was faithful and sprinkled water on Sotthisena. He was completely healed, and together they went to Benares, where Sotthisena's father was still king. He made Sotthisena king and became an ascetic. Sotthisena gave himself up to pleasure and neglected Sambulá. The ascetic, returning, found her thin and miserable and, learning the reason, admonished Sotthisena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa')"&gt;Malliká's&lt;/a&gt; great devotion to her husband. She is identified with Sambulá and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; with Sotthisena. J.v.88 98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The cave was used as a residence by monks who come to Rájagaha from afar (E.g., Vin.ii.76).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SA.iii.10) that the cave was so called because it was shaped like a snake's hood.

On a certain festival day, some goldsmiths were seated in a tent making merry. One of them, becoming sick through drink, vomited, saying: “Praise be to Saccatapáví.&quot; One of the others called him a fool, saying that all women were alike, and accepted a wager of one thousand that he would seduce Saccatapáví. The next day he disguised himself as an ascetic and stood near her hut, worshipping the sun. Saccatapáví saw him and worshipped him, but he neither looked at her nor spoke. On the fourth day he greeted her, and on the sixth day, as she stood near him, they talked of the penances they practiced, and the ascetic professed that his were far more severe than hers. But he confessed that he had found no spiritual calm; neither had she and they agreed that it would be better to return to and enjoy the lay life. He brought her to the city and having lain with her and made her drunk, he handed her over to his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was related by Kunála (q.v.), who said that he was the goldsmith of the story.

In the Commentary to the Mahápadána Sutta (DA.ii.407) the Salalaghara is spoken of as one of the four chief buildings, (mahágeháni) of Jetavana.

Sankha Játaka (No. 442). &lt;/b&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born in Moliní nagara (Benares) as a very rich brahmin, named Sankha. He spent six thousand daily on almsgiving. He had a ship built, equipped and prepared to sail for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannabhuumi')"&gt;Suvannabhúmi&lt;/a&gt;. A Pacceka, Buddha, seeing him with his divine eye, and foreseeing the danger in store for him, appeared before him on the way to the seaport. Sankha paid him all honour and presented him with his shoes and umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sankha's ship sprang a leak on the seventh day. Taking with him one companion, he dived overboard and swam in the direction of Moliní. He swam thus for seven days, till Manimekhalá, seeing his plight, came to his rescue and offered him food. But this he refused, as he was keeping the fast. The goddess told him that his purity in worshipping the Pacceka Buddha had been the cause of her coming to his aid and offered him a boon. He chose to be sent back to Moliní. The goddess provided him with a ship full of treasure, and he returned safely to Moliní with his attendant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related by way of thanks to a pious layman of &lt;a href="saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, who, having entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days, presented shoes to the Buddha and to the members of his Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; is identified with Sankha's attendant and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uppalavanna')"&gt;Uppalavanná&lt;/a&gt; with Manimekhalá (J.iv.15 22).

When Susíma was about sixteen, he took leave of his father and went to Benares to study the Vedas. His teacher, who was a friend of his father's, taught him all he knew, and then Susíma went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt;, where lived some Pacceka. Buddhas. He entered the Order under them, attained arahantship, and died while yet young. Having heard no news of his son for some time, Sankha was alarmed and went to Benares in search of him. There, after enquiry, he heard of his son's death as a Pacceka Buddha, and was shown the shrine erected in his memory. Sankha weeded the grass round the shrine, sprinkled sand, watered it, scattered wild flowers round it, and raised aloft his robe as banner over it. He then planted his parasol over the top and departed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha related the story to the monks at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;, after his return from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt;, to explain the unparalleled honours he had received during the journey. Because he had uprooted the grass round Susíma's shrine, a road of eight leagues was prepared for him to journey comfortably; because he had spread sand, his route was also so spread; because he had scattered flowers, his route was covered with flowers; because he had sprinkled water, there was a shower in Vesáli on his arrival; because he had raised a banner and set up a parasol, the whole cakkavála was gay with flags and parasols.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Saddhá Tissa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. King of Ceylon (77 59 B.C.). He was the brother of Dutthagámaní and was about a year younger. When he was ten, at the ceremony of initiation, he was forced to make a vow that he would never fight against his brother; but when his father, Kákavannatissa, died, he seized the throne in the absence of Dutthagámaní. Up to that time he had been in charge of the Díghavápi district. Dutthagámaní now made war upon him, but was defeated at Cúlanganiyapitthi. Later the tide turned, and Tissa had to flee to a monastery. Dutthagámaní surrounded the monastery, but some young monks carried Tissa out on a bed, covered up like a dead body. Gámaní discovered the ruse, but refrained from action. Through the intervention of Godhagatta Tissa Thera, the brothers were reconciled, and, thereafter, seem to have been devoted to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Gámaní's conquest of Anurádhapura, Tissa seems to have returned as governor of Díghavápi. When Gámaní lay dying, Tissa was sent for to complete the work of the Mahá Thúpa, that the king might see it before his death. This he got done by means of temporary structures, cunningly devised. He was enjoined to retain unimpaired all the services on behalf of the religion inaugurated by his brother, and, when the latter died, he was succeeded by Tissa, who ruled for eighteen years. He rebuilt the Lohapásáda after it was burnt down, and erected many viháras - Dakkhinágiri, Kallakálena, Kalambaka, Pettangaválika, Velangavitthika, Dubbalavápitissaka, Dúratissaka, Mátuviháraka and Díghavápi. He built a vihára to every yojana on the road from Anurádhapura to Díghavápi. He had two sons, Lañjatissa and Thúlathana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tissa was reborn after death in Tusita, and will be the second Chief Disciple of Metteyya Buddha. Mhv.xxii.73, 83; xxiv2ff.; xxxii.83; </data>
<data>xxxiii.4 17; Dpv.xx 2, 4ff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a very pious king, entirely devoted to the cause of religion. Various stories are mentioned about him in the Commentaries (See, e.g., Kálabuddharakkhita). He once walked five leagues to Mangana to pay his respects to Kujjatissa (q.v.) (AA.i.384f). On another occasion, he gave snipe to a novice from Kanthaka sálaparivena who would, however, accept only very little. Pleased with his moderation, the king paid him great honour (AA.i.264). He seems to have been specialty fond of the monks of Cetiyagiri (See VibhA.473). He was, apparently, also known as Dhammika Tissa. Dhammika Tissa once distributed one hundred cartloads of sugar (gula) among twelve thousand monks. A seven year old novice was sent by a monk who had just come to Cetiyagiri from Anurádhapura to fetch for him some sugar, about the size of a kapittha fruit. The attendant offered to give him a plateful, but the novice refused to take so much. The king heard the conversation, and, pleased with the novice, sent a further four hundred cartloads of sugar to be given to the Order (E.g., SA.iii.48). See also the story of Kukkutagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Saddhátissa&lt;/b&gt;.-A minister. He once gave to Pindapatikatissa Thera of Sudassanapadhanasala a bowl of food which he had bought for 8 kahapanas. The monk became an arahant before eating it. The deity of the king's parasol applauded and king Saddhátissa having sent for him gave him the district of Vaddhamanananagara. Later he shared with 30,000 monks water brought to him by the devas during a drought. The king hearing of this gave him Antaraganga. Sometime afterwards he became a sotápanna, gladdened by the sight of 12,000 monks walking round Ambatthala cetiya clad in robes given by him. Ras.ii.9f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Death is inevitable, lamenting is therefore useless (SN.vss.574 93). The sutta was preached in order to console a devout patron of the Buddha who, when his son died, starved for seven days (SNA.ii.457).

One day, when he was bathing in the river, a storm came on, and he ordered his servants to take him into the middle of the river and there bathe him. The servants thereupon flung him into the water and reported to the king that he was lost. As he was swept along on the stream, he caught hold of a tree trunk, and on to this tree trunk there came to cling, also, a snake, a rat, and a parrot, who had all lost their dwelling places in the storm. The Bodhisatta, who was an ascetic living on the bank of the river, rescued Duttha and his companions and looked after them. When they bade him farewell, the snake said that he had forty crores hidden in a certain spot, and the ascetic had only to ask for these and they were hits. The rat had thirty crores, also at the ascetic's disposal; the parrot promised the ascetic wagonloads of rice; and Duttha promised to provide him with the four requisites. In his heart, however, he hated the ascetic for an imaginary slight, and vowed vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Duttha became king, the ascetic wished to test the faith of his former guests. He went to the snake and called out his name, and the snake at once appeared, offering his treasure. The rat and the parrot did likewise, but Duttha, riding in a procession and seeing him from afar, gave orders that the ascetic should be beaten and put to death. On his way to the place of execution the ascetic kept on repeating: &quot;They knew the world who framed this proverb true: a log pays better salvage than some men!&quot; When asked what these words meant, he related the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enraged citizens, seizing Duttha, put him to death and made the ascetic king. Later, he brought the snake, the rat, and the parrot to </data>
<data>the palace and looked after them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's attempts to kill the Buddha. Devadatta is identified with Duttha, the snake with Sáriputta, the rat with Moggallána, and the parrot with Ananda. J.i.322 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He then went about proclaiming in Rájagaha that he knew the Dhamma and Vinaya of the Sákyaputta monks, and that was why he had left their Order. The Buddha, being told of this, visited the Paribbájakáráma, on the banks of the Sappiniká, and challenged Sarabha to repeat his statement. Three times the challenge was uttered, but Sarabha sat silent. The Buddha then declared to the Paribbájakas that no one could say that his claim to Enlightenment was unjustified, or that his dhamma, if practised, did not lead to the destruction of Ill. After the Buddha's departure, the Paribbájakas taunted and abused Sarabha (A.i.185ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (AA.i.412 f ) that Sarabha joined the Order at the request of the Paribbájakas. They had failed to find any fault with the Buddha's life, and thought that his power was due to an &quot;ávattanímáyá,&quot; which he and his disciples practised once a fortnight behind closed doors. Sarabha agreed to find it out and learn it. He therefore went to Gijjhakúta, where he showed great humility to all the resident monks. An Elder, taking pity on him, ordained him. In due course he learned the pátimokkha, which, he realized, was what the Paribbájakas took to be the Buddha's &quot;máyá.&quot; Having learned it, he went back to the Paribbájakas, taught it to them, and with them went about in the city boasting that he knew the Buddha's teaching and had found it worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was the residence of the Deva Mahásumana (Mhv.i.33) and when the Buddha visited the Island for the third time, he left on the mountain the mark of his footprint (Mhv.i.77; cf. Nammadá, and Saccabaddha). Owing to this, the mountain became a sacred place of pilgrimage. In later times many kings of Ceylon paid the shrine great honour. Vijayabáhu I. gifted the village of Gilímalaya for the feeding of pilgrims, and set up rest-houses for them on the different routes, for the maintenance of which he provided. (Cv.ix.64f)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kittinissanka made a special pilgrimage to Sumanakúta and mentioned it in his inscriptions (Cv.lxxx.24; Cv.Trs.ii.128, n.4). Parakkamabáhu II. did likewise, and also gave ten gávutas of rich land for the shrine on the top of the peak (Cv.lxxxv.118). He further gave orders to his pious minister, Devappatirája, to make the roads leading to the mountain easy of access. The minister repaired the roads, and built bridges at Bodhitala over the Khajjotanadí, at Ullapanaggáma, and at Ambaggáma. He constructed rest houses at suitable spots, and placed stepping stones on the way to the summit. Then the king himself visited the peak and held a great festival there lasting for three days (Cv.lxxxvi.9, 18 ff). Vijayabáhu IV., too, made a pilgrimage to the sacred mountain (Cv.lxxxviii.48).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Víravikkama also went there and lit a lamp, fifteen cubits in girth and five cubits high (Cv.xcii.17). Rájasúha I., in his desire to take revenge on the Buddhist monks, handed the shrine over to Hindu priests (Cv.xciii.12), but Vimaladhammasúriya II. restored to it all honours and held a great festival, lasting for seven days, at the peak (Cv.xcvii.16f). His son, </data>
<data>Narindasíha, made two pilgrimages there (Cv.xcvii.31), while Vijayarájasíha had a feast of lamps celebrated there (Cv.xcviii.84). Kittisirirájasíha had a mandapa built round the footprint surmounted by a parasol, and assigned the revenues from the village of Kuttápiti to the monks who looked after the shrine (Cv.c.221).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The districts round Samantakúta were, in early times, the habitation of the Pulindas. It was believed (Mhv.vii.67) that, when Vijaya forsook Kuvení, her children fled thither and that their descendants were the Pulindas. In later times, too, mention is made (E.g., Cv.lxi.70) of the fact that the people dwelling in the neighbourhood of Samantakútta refused to pay taxes to the king. From very early times the mountain was the dwelling of numerous monks. Thus, in the time of Dutthagámaní, there were nine hundred monks there, under Malayamahádeva Thera (Mhv.xxxii.49). The Damila Díghajantu offered a red robe to the Ákásacetiya in Samantagiri vihára, and, as a result, won heaven, because he remembered the gift at the moment of his death (AA.i.376; MA.ii.955). The rivers Maháváluka and Kalyáni rise in Sumanakúta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sandaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda, staying at the Ghositáráma in Kosambí, visits the Pilakkhaguhá near Devakata pool, where the Paribbájaka Sandaka is staying with some five hundred followers. Ananda is asked to give a discourse on the Buddha's teachings, and speaks of the four antitheses to the higher life: there is the teacher who holds that it does not matter whether actions are good or bad; the teacher who holds that no evil is done by him who acts himself or causes others to act; the teacher holding that there is no cause for either depravity or purity; and, lastly, the teacher who holds, among other things, that men make an end of ill only when they have completed their course of transmigrations, like a ball of twine which continues rolling as long as there is string to unwind. On these heresies cf. Sáleyyaka Sutta. The reference is evidently to the teachings of Purána Kassapa, Makkhali Gosála and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda then proceeds to explain the four comfortless vocations: the teacher who claims to be all knowing and all seeing; the teacher whose doctrine is traditional and scriptural; the rationalist of pure reason and criticism teaching a doctrine of his own reasoning; and, lastly, the teacher who is stupid and deficient. Ananda then describes the Buddha's own teaching, leading up to the four Jhánas. Sandaka and his followers accept the Buddha as their teacher. M.i.513-24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He lived with three friends: a Monkey, a Jackal, and an Otter. The three lived in great friendship, and the Hare was their guide in the good life. One day, the Hare, observing the approach of the full moon, told his friends that the next day would be a fast day and that they must collect food and give it to any beggar who approached them. The animals all went out very early in the morning, one by one; the Otter found some fish buried in the sand; the Jackal a dead lizard, some meat, and a pot of curds; and the Monkey some fruits; and, finding that nobody appeared to claim them, each took them to his own dwelling. The Hare had only kusa grass, which he could not offer to anyone. He therefore decided to give his own body, and, because of this brave decision, Sakka's throne was heated. Disguised as a brahmin, he came to test the Hare. He went first to the other animals in turn and they all offered him what they had. He then approached the Hare, whom he asked for food. The Hare asked him to collect faggots from the wood and make a fire. Then, telling the brahmin that he would give him his own body, without the brahmin having the necessity of killing him, he shook out any animals which might lurk in his fur, and then jumped into the fire as into a lotusbed. By the power of Sakka, the fire remained as cool as snow, and Sakka revealed his identity. Then, so that the Hare's nobility might be known to all the world, he took some essence of the Himálaya and painted the form of a hare in the moon, to remain there during this whole kappa. Having done this, he went to the Hare and talked of the Doctrine, and then, making the Hare lie down on his bed of grass, Sakka went back to his heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in the course of giving thanks to a </data>
<data>landowner of Sávatthi who had entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days. Ananda is identified with the Otter, Moggallána with the Jackal, and Sáriputta with the Monkey (J.iii.51 6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is included in the Cariyápitaka (i.10) and in the Játakamálá (No. 6). It is also referred to in the Jayaddisa Játaka (J.v.33). This Játaka exemplifies the practice of dánapáramitá. BuA.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sankassa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city, thirty leagues from Sávatthi. (DhA.iii.224). It was there that the Buddha returned to earth, after preaching the Abhidhamma Pitaka in Távatimsa, following the performance of the Twin Miracle under the Gandamba tree. As the time approached for the Buddha to leave Távatimsa , Moggallána (Anuruddha, according to SNA.ii.570; cf. Vsm., p.391) announced his coming return to the multitude, who had been waiting at Sávatthi, fed by Culla Anáthapindika, while Moggallána expounded the Dhamma. They then made their way to Sankassa. The descent of the Buddha took place on the day of the Mahápavárana festival. Sakka provides three ladders for the Buddha's descent from Sineru. to the earth: on the right was a ladder of gold for the gods; on the left a silver ladder for Mahá Brahmá and his retinue; and in the middle a ladder of jewels for the Buddha. The assembled people covered the earth for thirty leagues round. There was a clear view of the nine Brahma worlds above and of Avíci below. The Buddha was accompanied by Pañcasikha, Mátali, Mahá Brahmá and Suyáma. Sáriputta was the first to welcome him (followed by Uppalavanná, SNA.ii.570), and the Buddha preached the Law, starting with what was within the comprehension even of a puthujjana, and ending with what only a Buddha could understand. On this occasion was preached the Parosahassa Játaka (q.v.) to proclaim to the multitude the unparalleled wisdom of Sáriputta (DhA.iii.224ff.; see also SNA.ii.570). It is said' that the Buddha's descent to Sankassa had provided opportunity for Moggallána to show his eminence in iddhi, Anuruddha in dibbacakkhu, and Punna in skill in preaching, and the Buddha wished to give Sáriputta a chance of shining in his wisdom. (Ibid., loc. cit.; J.iv.266; see also Jhánasodhana, Sarabhamiga, </data>
<data>and Candábha Játakas). He therefore asked of Sáriputta questions which no one else could answer. The opening words of the Sáriputta Sutta (q.v.) are supposed to refer to this descent from Tusita (sic). The site of the city gate of Sankassa is one of the &quot;unchangeable&quot; spots of the world (avijahitatthánam). All Buddhas descend at that spot to the world of men after preaching the Abhidhamma (BuA.106, 247; MA.i.371, etc.). From Sankassa the Buddha went to Jetavana (J.i.193). A shrine was erected on the spot where the Buddha's right foot first touched the ground at Sankassa (DhA.iii.227). When the Chinese pilgrims, Hiouen Thsang and Fa Hien, visited the place, they found three ladders, which had been built of brick and stone by the ancients, to commemorate the Buddha's descent, but the ladders were nearly sunk in the earth. (Beal, op. cit., i.203; Fa Hien, p.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was, in the Buddha's time, a deer park at Sankassa where Suhemanta Thera heard the Buddha preach (ThagA.i.212). During the Vajjiputta controversy, Revata Thera, on his way from Soreyya to Sahájáti, went through Sankassa. The road he took passed through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbará and Aggálapura (Vin.ii.299f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sankassa is now identified with Sankissa Basantapura on the north bank of the Ikkhumatí (Kálínadí), between Atranji and Kanoj, twenty-three miles west of Fatehgarh and forty five north of Kanoj.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Vijayabáhu IV., at the instigation of his father, Parakkamabáhu II., arranged that the whole community of monks in Ceylon should assemble there and perform the ceremony of admitting new members into the Order (Cv.lxxxvii.71; for identification see Cv.Trs.ii.182, n.4). In this he was assisted by his brother, Vírabáhu, and the Chronicles (E.g., Cv.lxxxix.47ff) give great details of the preparations for the ceremony, which lasted for a fortnight.

They held that there is no higher life practised among Devas, that the convert gives up corruption piecemeal, and that the putthujjana renounces, passion and hate (Kvu.i.1, 3, 4, 5). They also held various views in common with other schismatic schools, such as the Andhakas, Pubbaseliyas, etc. In Tibetan sources they are called Sammatiyá, and are described as disciples of a teacher named Sammata.

The sutta was preached by the Buddha in reply to a question asked at the Mahásamaya concourse, by the created (nimmita) Buddha (SNA.i.352). It was the last of the suttas preached on that occasion, and was intended for those devas who were rágacaritas. At the end of the discourse one thousand crores attained to arahantship (SNA.361, 367).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is a dissertation on the right path for a Bhikkhu. He has no belief in omens, dreams, etc., subdues his passion, puts away slander, anger, avarice etc., and is liberated from bonds.

Because he stayed continuously in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sitavana')"&gt;Sítavana&lt;/a&gt;, meditating on the nature of the body, he came to be called &quot;Sítavaniya.&quot; In due course he won arahantship, and the verses, declaring his &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/a/annaa')"&gt;aññá&lt;/a&gt;, are included in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/theragaathaa')"&gt;Theragáthá&lt;/a&gt; (Thag.vs.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (ThagA.i.46) that when Sambhúta was meditating, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessavana')"&gt;Vessavana&lt;/a&gt; passing that way, saw him and worshipped him, and left two Yakkhas to keep guard and to tell Sambhúta of his visit. When the Thera had finished his meditations, the Yakkhas gave him Vessavana's message offering him protection. But he refused their protection saying that the mindfulness taught by the Buddha was sufficient guard. On his return journey, Vessavana again visited him, and, realizing from the appearance of the Elder that he had achieved his goal, went to the Buddha at Sávatthi and announced to him Sambhúta's attainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sambhúta had been a householder in the time of Atthadassí Buddha, and conveyed the Buddha and a large company across a river.

On being asked by Mátali as to whom he so honoured, Sakka answered that he worshipped all monks and laymen who led the virtuous life. S.i.234.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

When his parents died he gave away his wealth, became an ascetic in the Himálaya, and developed iddhi powers. During the rains he returned to Benares, where, at the king's invitation, he lived in the royal park. For twelve years he did this, till, one day, the king had to leave to quell a frontier rebellion, after having instructed the queen to look after the ascetic. One evening the ascetic returned rather late to the palace, and the queen, rising hastily at his arrival, let her garment slip. The ascetic's mind became filled with thoughts of lust, and he lost his powers. On his return to the hermitage, he lay there for seven days without touching food. On his return, the king visited the ascetic, who explained that his heart had been wounded. Asking the king to retire from the hut, he once more developed his trance. He then took leave of the king and returned to Himavá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk who was filled with discontent because he had fallen in love with a woman whom he met on his alms rounds. The king is identified with Ananda. J.ii.271-77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On the way he met a young man from Benares, Satadhamma, a magnifico. They travelled together, and when the time came for the meal, because Satadhamma had no food, the Bodhisatta offered him some. &quot;I could not possibly take yours,&quot; said the magnifico, &quot;because you are the lowest of the low.&quot; The Bodhisatta ate some of the food and put the rest away. In the evening they bathed, and the Bodhisatta ate without offering Satadhamma anything. The latter had expected to be asked again and was very hungry. But finding that he was offered nothing, he asked the Bodhisatta for some and ate it. As soon as he had finished he was seized with remorse that he should thus have disgraced his family. So greatly was he upset that he vomited the food, and with it some blood. He plunged into the wood and was never heard of again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to monks who earned their living in the twenty one unlawful ways, as physicians, messengers, etc. The Buddha summoned them and warned that food unlawfully come by was like red hot iron, a deadly poison. It was like partaking of the leavings of the vilest of mankind. J.ii.82 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Santati&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A minister of Pasenadi. Because he quelled a frontier disturbance, the king gave over the kingdom to him for seven days, and gave him a woman skilled in song and dance. For seven days Santati enjoyed himself, drinking deeply; on the seventh day he went to the bathing place fully adorned, riding the state elephant. The Buddha met him on the way, and Santati saluted him from the elephant. The Buddha smiled and passed on. When questioned by Ananda, the Buddha answered that on that very day Santati would attain arahantship and die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santati spent part of the day amusing himself in the water, and then sat in the drinking hall of the park. The woman came on the stage and sang and danced, but she had fasted for seven days to acquire more grace of body, and, as she danced, she fell down dead. Santati was overwhelmed with a mighty sorrow, and straightway became sober. He then sought the Buddha for consolation in his grief. The Buddha preached a four line stanza, and Santati attained arahantship and asked the Buddha's permission to pass into nibbána. The Buddha agreed, on condition that he rose into the air and told to the assembled people the story of his past life. Santati agreed to this, and, rising to a height of seven palm trees, related the meritorious deed of his past life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety kappas ago, in the time of Vipassí Buddha, he was a householder of Bandhumatí, and became a follower of the Buddha and went about proclaiming the virtues of the Three Refuges. King Bandhumá met him and gave him a garland of flowers to wear and a horse on which to ride, while proclaiming the Law. He later gave him a chariot, great wealth, beautiful jewels and an elephant. Thus, for eighty four thousand years, Santati went about preaching the Dhamma, and there was diffused from his body the fragrance of sandalwood, and </data>
<data>from his mouth the fragrance of the lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he related his story, seated cross legged in the air, he developed the idea of fire and passed into nibbána. Flames burst from his body and burnt it up. The Buddha had his relics collected and a shrine built for them at the meeting of four highways. Discussion arose as to whether Santati should be called a brahmin or a monk. The Buddha said that both names were equally appropriate.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sambara&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chief of the Asuras. In the &quot;Isayo Samuddaká Sutta” (S.i.227) (q.v.) we are told that, because Sambara refused the request of the sages for a guarantee of safety, they cursed him, and his mind was deranged. Buddhaghosa adds (SA.i.266) that, on account of this mental derangement, he came to be called Vepacitti (s.v.). Elsewhere (S.i.239), however, it is said that once Sakka asked Vepacitti to teach him Sambara's magic art (Sambarimáyá). Vepacitti consulted the Asuras and then warned Sakka against learning it because, through his art, Sambara had fallen into purgatory, where he had been suffering for a century. Buddhaghosa, in this context (SA.i.272), calls Sambara an Asurinda, a juggler (máyáví) who, having practised his máyá, has roasted for the past century in purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Rhys Davis (KS.i.306 n) thinks there was a rank of Sambara resembling that of Sakka, and that each succeeding Sambara learnt the magic art.

The Buddha answers and includes in his answer his justification for the foundation of the Order, for the enunciation of the Vinaya, and the practical rules by which life in the Order is regulated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta also contains a list of ordinary occupations followed by people in the Buddha's day, which forms interesting reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the introductory story, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt; explains that he has already put the question to the founders of six other Orders:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa')"&gt;Púrana Kassapa, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makkhali_gosala')"&gt;Makkhali Gosála,   &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajitakesakambala')"&gt;Ajita Kesakambala,   &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pakudha_kaccayana')"&gt;Pakudha Kaccáyana,   &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nátaputta   &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="sanjaya_belatthiputta')"&gt;Sañjaya Belatthiputta.  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these teachers, instead of answering his questions, give a general statement of their theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summaries given here of their teachings are of great interest, because they form some sort of evidence, at least, as to the </data>
<data>speculations favoured by them. By means of a counter question, the Buddha finds from Ajátasattu that even if a servant of his joined the Order, he would receive the king's honour and respect. Then the Buddha proceeds to show, step by step, the fruits higher and nobler, which await the samana, immediate in their effect, culminating in the six fold abhiññá of the arahant. The king is greatly impressed, takes refuge in the Buddha, and expresses his remorse for having killed his father. The Buddha utters no word of blame, but after the departure of the king, he informs the monks that if Ajátasattu had not been guilty of patricide he would have realized the first fruit of the Path (D.i.47 86).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds (DA.i.238) that as a result of hearing this discourse, Ajátasattu would, in the future, become a Pacceka Buddha named Viditavisesa. From this moment, Ajátasattu was one of the Buddha's most devoted followers. It is said that, after his father's death, Ajátasattu could never sleep at night until he had heard the Buddha, after which he enjoyed peaceful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Having heard from the Thera Mahádeva of Dámahálaka of the merits of giving rice gruel, he arranged for a regular distribution of it. He used to visit Pácínadípaka in order to eat jambu fruits there, and the people, annoyed by his visits, poisoned him. He was succeeded by Sanghabodhi.

The Buddha stopped there on his way to see Punna in Sunáparanta, and preached to the hermit who lived on the mountain, and who also was called Saccabaddha. At the end of the sermon the hermit became an arahant. From Saccabaddha the Buddha went to Sunáparanta. On the way back to Sávatthi he stopped at the river Nammadá, and from there he proceeded to Saccabaddha, where he left his footprint on the hard stone as clear as on kneaded clay. From Saccabaddha he returned to Jetavana.

There they found a castaway, from whom they learned that the island was safe and fruitful. So they stayed there, and, as time went on, they grew fat and began to drink toddy made from sugar cane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deities, incensed because the island was being fouled with their excrement, decided to send a wave up to drown them. A friendly deity, wishing to save them, gave them warning; but another cruel deity asked them to pay no heed to her words. Five hundred of the families, led by a wise man, built a ship in which they placed all their belongings in case the warning should prove true. No harm would be done should it prove false. The others, led by a fool, laughed at them. At the end of the dark fortnight the sea rose; the five hundred wise families escaped, the others were drowned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to five hundred families who were born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niraya')"&gt;Niraya&lt;/a&gt; as a result of following&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;.

Ibid., 98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Sangha&lt;/b&gt;. A minister of Dutthagámaní. He gave alms, in circumstances that won applause from the deity of the king's parasol, to Mahánága Thera of Kotagallapabbata, to a monk of Timbarugáma, and to another of Devagirivihára and Cetiyapabbata. The king sent for him and made him Treasurer. It is probably this same Sangha that is mentioned in the Extended Mahávamsa (xxxii.246) as destined to become the chief patron of Matteyya Budda. His wife was Sanghadattá (q.v.). Ras.ii.75f, 180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Sangha&lt;/b&gt;. A minister of Kákavannatissa; his brother was Cullasangha and his daughter Kiñcisanghá. When the latter was taught cooking, the first meal she made was given to the monks. Thus she came to be called Sanghupattháyiká. Later, she was abandoned by her parents at Nigrodhasálakhanda, but she was rescued by Sakka in the guise of a youth. She gave alms to a monk of Cittalapabbáta when she had been starving for seven days, and also gave her only garment, herself wearing leaves. The king heard of this from the deity of his parasol, and, having sent for her, gave her in marriage to one of his sons.

His wife, lying on her deathbed, asked her son to get it for her while she was yet alive. He went and recovered the money; but while he was away his mother died, and, because of her great love for him, was born as a jackal. She tried to prevent him from entering a wood infested with robbers, headed by the Bodhisatta, but the man did not understand what the jackal said and kept on driving her away. A crane, flying overhead, cried out to the robbers, announcing the lad's approach, but he, taking it to be a bird of good omen, saluted it. The Bodhisatta heard both sounds, and when his band captured the man, he told him that he did not know how to distinguish between friend and foe and sent him off with a warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to two of the Chabbaggiyá, Pandu and Lohitaka. They questioned the Buddha's teachings on certain points and encouraged others to do the same, the result being quarrel and strife. The Buddha sent for them and told them that this was a foolish policy; they did not know what was good for them. J.ii.387 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sabhúti Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of Sumanasetthí and the younger brother of Anáthapindika. On the day of the dedication of Jetavana, he heard the Buddha preach and left the world. After ordination he mastered the two categories (of Vinaya rules), and, after obtaining a subject for meditation, lived in the forest. There he developed insight, and attained arahantship on the basis of mettá-jhána. Teaching the Dhamma without distinction or limitation, he was declared chief of those who lived remote and in peace (aranavihárinam aggo), and of those who were worthy of gifts (dakkhineyyánam) (A.i.24; cf. Ud.vi.7, where the Buddha commends his proficiency in meditation). It is said that when he went begging for alms he would develop mettá-jhána at each door, hence every gift made to him was of the highest merit. In the course of his travels he came to Rájagaha, and Bimbisára promised to build him a dwelling-place. But the king forgot his promise, and Subhúti meditated in the open air. There was no rain, and, discovering the cause, the king had a leaf hut built for him. As soon as Subhúti entered the hut and seated himself cross legged on the bed of hay, rain began to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he belonged to a rich family and was called Nanda. Later he left the world and lived the hermit's life, at the head of forty four thousand others. The Buddha visited Nanda's hermitage and accepted from him a gift of fruit and flowers. He asked one of his monks, proficient in mettá and eminent in receiving gifts, to preach the anumodaná. At the end of the sermon all the other hermits became arahants, but Nanda's attention was fixed on the majesty of the preaching monk, and he did not reach any attainment. Later, discovering the qualities in which the preacher had </data>
<data>attained eminence, Nanda resolved that he too would reach similar eminence. AA.i.124f.; ThagA.i.17ff.; UdA.348f; see also Ap.i.67f., where Nanda is called Kosiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verses attributed to him are included in the Theragáthá (vs.1) and also in the Milinda-Pañha (pp.356,391).

He was son of the king of Sucandaka, and Upasanta, son of the chaplain, was his friend. These two placed four very learned men at the four gates of the city to inform them of the arrival of any wise men. They announced the arrival of Atthadassí Buddha.

Sucírata confesses ignorance, and declares that none but Vidhura, chaplain of the king of Benares, could find the answer. At once the king sends him with an escort and a present and a tablet of gold on which the answer may be written. Sucírata visits other sages on the way, and finally Vidhura, who had been his school mate. When the question is asked, Vidhura refers it to his son Bhadrakára, who, however, is busy with an intrigue with a woman and cannot give attention to the matter. He sends Sucírata to his younger brother, Sañjaya, but he, too, is occupied, and sends him on to his brother Sambhava (the Bodhisatta), a boy of seven. Sucírata finds him playing in the street, but when he is asked the question, he answers it with all the fluent mastery of a Buddha. All Benares, including the king, hears the answer and stays to listen. Sambhava is paid great honour and receives many presents. Sucírata notes the answer on the golden tablet and brings it to Dhañanjaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is related in reference to the Buddha's great wisdom. Dhanañjaya is identified with Ananda, Sucírata with Anuruddha, Vidhura with Kassapa, Bhadrakára with Moggallána and Sañjaya with Sariputta. J.v.57 67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He asks the Buddha a question on dhátu, and the Buddha explains it to him. In neither case does the Commentary say anything about Saddho (or Sandho). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The translator of the Samyutta regards saddho as an epithet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It contains an account of the discussion between the Buddha and Sangárava bráhmana of Candalakappa. See Sangárava. M.ii.209ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sangárava Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; An account of the visit of the Buddha and Ananda to Sangárava bráhmana of Sávatthi. Sangárava explains to the Buddha that he washes away his faults by bathing morning and evening. The Buddha says that the only true purification is through the Dhamma. S.i.182f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sangárava Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha explains to Sangárava that mantras learnt at a time when the heart is possessed by sensual lust, malevolence, sloth and torpor, excitement and flurry, doubt and wavering, are easily forgotten; as is the case of a man who tries to see his reflection in a bowl of water, either mixed with some dye, or heated on the fire, or overspread with mossy grass, or ruffled by the wind, or muddied and set in the dark. The cultivation of the seven bojjhanga will remove these disadvantages. S.v.121ff.; cf. No. 5 below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Sangárava Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;Sangárava visits the Buddha and states that a brahmin is of more use than a Paribbájaka because he not only performs sacrifices himself, but makes others do likewise. The Buddha says that the appearance of a Tathágata in the world is of benefit to many beings. Ananda asks Sangárava which of the two practices appears to him the simpler and of greater profit. Sangárava evades a straight answer, even though asked three times. The Buddha then tells him of the marvels of iddhi, ádesaná and anusásaná possessed by monks, and describes them in detail. Sangárava admits that the </data>
<data>ádesaná pátiháriya appeals moist to him. The Buddha tells him that numerous monks in the Order possess all three marvels. A.i.168ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Sangárava Sutta. &lt;/b&gt;Sangárava visits the Buddha and questions him on the power of remembering mantras. Same as No. 3 above.  A.iii.230f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Sangárava Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha tells Sangárava, in answer to a question, that wrong view, wrong thinking, speech, action, living, effort, mindfulness, concentration, knowledge and release, are the &quot;hither shore&quot; and their opposites the &quot;further shore.&quot; A.v.232f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Sangárava Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha tells Sangárava that taking life, theft, wrong sexual conduct, falsehood, spiteful and bitter speech, idle babble, coveting, harmfulness, wrong view, are the &quot;hither shore” and abstention from these is the &quot;further shore.&quot; A.v.252f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

At the Thúpáráma he defeated in argument the Thera Gothábhaya, and became a favourite of King Gothábhaya, being appointed tutor to his sons, Jetthatissa and Mahásena. When Jenhatissa came to the throne, Sanghamitta returned to Cola, as he was not greatly liked by the king; but on the accession of Mahásena he returned to Ceylon.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acting on Sanghamitta's advice, Mahásena decreed that no alms should be given to the monks of Mahávihára and all the treasures belonging to Mahávihára were taken to Abhayagiri with the help of the minister Sona. Sanghamitta had the Lohapásáda destroyed. It was not till his favourite minister, Meghavannábhaya, rose in revolt against him, that Mahásena saw the error of his ways and cast off Sanghamitta. While the king was away, Sanghamitta attempted to destroy the Thúpáráma, and one of the king's wives persuaded a labourer to kill both Sanghamitta and Sona.

Uggáhamána tells him that, in his view, the triumphant recluse is he who does no evil, says and thinks no evil, and earns his living in no evil way. Pañcakanga reports this to the Buddha, who says that, according to Uggáhamána, a tiny babe on its back would be such a recluse! No, says the Buddha, the triumphant recluse is one who is an adept in the Noble Eightfold Path and in utter knowledge and in utter deliverance, and he goes on to describe such a recluse in detail.' v.l.

Mention is also made of other Sákyan settlements   e.g., Cátumá, Khomadussa, Sámagáma, Devadaha, Silávatí, Nagaraka, Medatalumpa, Sakkhara and Ulumpa (q.v.). Within the Sákyan tribe there were probably several clans, gottá. The Buddha himself belonged to the Gotamagotta. It has been suggested (E.g., Thomas, op. cit., 22) that this was a brahmin clan, claiming descent from the ancient isi Gotama. The evidence for this suggestion is, however, very meagre. Nowhere do we find the Sákyans calling themselves brahmins. On the other hand, we find various clans claiming a share of the Buddha's relics on the ground that they, like the Buddha, were khattiyas (D.ii.165). It is stated a that the Sákyans were a haughty people. Vin.ii.183; D.i.90; J.i.88; DhA.iii.163. Hiouen Thsang, however, found them obliging and gentle in manners (Beal, op. cit., ii.14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha first visited them, after his Enlightenment, they refused to honour him on account of his youth. The Buddha then performed a miracle and preached the Vessantara Játaka, and their pride was subdued. They evidently fond of sports and mention is made of a special school of archery conducted by a Sákyan family, called Vedhaññá (D.iii.117; DA.iii.905). When the prince Siddhattha Gotama (later the Buddha) wished to marry, no Sákyan would give him his daughter until he had showed his proficiency in sport (J.i.58).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sákyans evidently had no king. Theirs was a republican form of government, probably with a leader, elected from time to time. The administration and judicial affairs of the gotta were discussed in their Santhágára, or Mote Hall, at Kapilavatthu. See, e.g., D.i.91; the Sákyans had a </data>
<data>similar Mote Hall at Cátumá (M.i.457). The Mallas of Kusinárá also had a Santhágára (D.ii.164); so did the Licchavis of Vesáli (Vin.i.233; M.i.228).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambattha (q.v.) once visited it on business; so did the envoys of Pasenadi, when he wished to marry a Sákyan maiden (see below). A new Mote Hall was built at Kapilavatthu while the Buddha was staying at the Nigrodháráma, and he was asked to inaugurate it. This he did by a series of ethical discourses lasting through the night, delivered by himself, Ananda, and Moggallána. M.i.353f.; S.iv.182f; the hall is described at SA.iii.63; cf. UdA.409.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sákyans were very jealous of the purity of their race; they belonged to the Ádiccagotta, (Ádiccá náma gottena, Sákiyá náma játiyá, SN. vs.423) and claimed descent from Okkáka (q.v.). Their ancestors were the nine children of Okkáka, whom he banished in order to give the kingdom to Jantukumára, his son by another queen. These nine children went towards Himavá, and, having founded Kapilavatthu (q.v. for details), lived there. To the eldest sister they gave the rank of mother, and the others married among themselves. The eldest sister, Piyá, later married Ráma, king of Benares, and their descendants became known as the Koliyans (see Koliyá for details). When Okkáka heard of this, he praised their action, saying, &quot;Sakyá vata bho kumárá, paramasakyá vata bho rájakumára; hence their name came to be &quot;Sakyá.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SNA.i.352f.; cf. DA.i.258. Okkáka had a slave girl, Disá, her offspring were the Kanháyanas, to which gotta belonged Ambattha (q.v.). The Mhv.ii.12ff gives the history of the direct descent of the Buddha from Okkáka, and this contains a list of the Sákyan chiefs of Kapilavatthu: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Okkámukha was Okkáka's eldest son; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Nipuna, Candimá, Candamukha, Sivisañjaya, Vessantara, </data>
<data>  Jáli, Síhaváhana and Síhassara were among his descendants. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Síhassara had eighty-two thousand sons and grandsons,   of whom Jayasena was the last. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Jayasena's son was Síhahanu, and his daughter   Yasodhará. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Síhahanu's wife was Kaccána, daughter of Devadahasakka   of Devadaha, whose son Añjana married Yasodhará. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Añjana had two sons, Dandapáni and Suppabuddha, and two   daughters, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Máyá and Pajápatí. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Síhahanu had five sons and two daughters: Suddhodana,   Dhotodana, Sakkodana, Sukkodana, Amitodana, Amitá and Pamitá. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Máyá and Pajápatí were married to Suddhodana, and   Máyá's son was the Buddha. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Suppabuddha married Amitá and they had two children,   Bhaddakaccáná and Devadatta. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The consort of the Bodhisatta was Bhaddakaccáná; their   son was Ráhula.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the very first there seems to have been intermarriage between the Sákyans and the Koliyans; but there was evidently a good deal of endogamy among the Sákyans, which earned for them the rebuke of the Koliyans in the quarrel between them   &quot;like dogs, jackals, and such  like beasts, cohabiting with their own sisters. E.g., SNA.i.357; J.v.412 L; there were eighty two thousand rájás among the Koliyans and Sákyans (SNA.i.140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quarrel, which broke out in the Buddha's lifetime, between the Sákyans and the Koliyans is several times referred to in the books. The longest account is found in the introductory story of the Kunála Játaka. The cause of the dispute was the use of the water of the River Rohiní (q.v.), which flowed between the two kingdoms. The quarrel waxed fierce, and a bloody battle was imminent, when the Buddha, arriving in the air between the two hosts, asked </data>
<data>them, &quot;Which is of more priceless value, water or khattiya chiefs?&quot; He thus convinced them of their folly and made peace between them. On this occasion he preached five Játaka stories -  the Phandana, Daddabha, Latukika, Rukkhadhamma and Vattaka (Sammodamána) -  and the Attadanda Sutta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To show their gratitude the Sákyans and Koliyans gave each two hundred and fifty young men from their respective families to join the Order of the Buddha. (J.v.412f.; for their history see also SNA.i.358f ) Earlier, during the Buddha's first visit to Kapilavatthu, when he had humbled the pride of his kinsmen by a display of miracles, each Sákyan family had given one representative to enter the Order and to help their famous kinsman. The wives of these, and of other Sákyans who had joined the Order, were the first to become nuns under Pajápatí Gotamí (q.v.) when the Buddha gave permission for women to enter the Order. Among the most eminent of the Sákyan young men, who now joined, were Anuruddha, Ananda, Bhaddiya, Kimbila, Bhagu and Devadatta. Their barber, Upáli, entered the Order at the same time; they arranged that he should be ordained first, so that he might be higher than they in seniority and thus receive their obeisance, and thereby humble their pride Vin.ii.181f.; according to DhA.i.133, eighty thousand Sákyan youths had joined the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha states, in the Aggañña Sutta, that the Sákyans were vassals of King Pasenadi of Kosala. D.iii.83 (Sakyá . . . Pasenadi-Kosalassa anuyuttá bhavanti, karonti Sakyá rañño Pasenadimhi Kosale nipaccakáram abhivádanam paccupatthánam añjalikammam sámícikammam); cf. SN.vs 422, where the Buddha describes his country as being &quot;Kosalesu niketino.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, when Pasenadi wished to establish connection with the Buddha's family by marrying one of the daughters of a Sákyan chief, the Sákyans </data>
<data>decided in their Mote Hall that it would be beneath their dignity to marry one of their daughters to the King of Kosala. But as they dared not refuse Pasenadi's request, the Sákyan chieftain, Mahánáma, solved the difficulty by giving him Vásabhakhattiyá (q.v.), who was his daughter by a slave girl, Nágamundá. By her Pasenadi had a son, Vidúdabha. When Pasenadi discovered the trick, he deprived his wife and her son of all their honours, but restored them on the intervention of the Buddha. Later, when Vidúdabha, who had vowed vengeance on the Sákyans for the insult offered to his father, became king, he marched into Kapilavatthu and there massacred the Sákyans, including women and children. The Buddha felt himself powerless to save them from their fate because they had committed sin in a previous life by throwing poison into a river. Only a few escaped, and these came to be called the Nalasákiyá and the Tinasákiyá. The Mhv. Tíká (p. 180) adds that, during this massacre, some of the Sákyans escaped to the Himálaya, where they built a city, which came to be called Moriyanagara because the spot resounded with the cries of peacocks. This was the origin of the Moriya dynasty, to which Asoka belonged (189). Thus Asoka and the Buddha were kinsmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Sákyans who thus escaped was Pandu, son of Amitodana. He crossed the Ganges, and, on the other side of the river, founded a city. His daughter was Bhaddakaccáná (q.v.), who later married Panduvásudeva, king of Ceylon. Thus the kings of Ceylon were connected by birth to the Sákyans. Mhv.viii.18ff. Six of her brothers also came to Ceylon, where they founded settlements: Ráma, Uruvela, Anurádha Vijita, Dígháyu and Rohana (Mhv.ix 6ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, having received a present of rice and ghee, he took it home, made his fire blaze up, and put the rice into the fire. The flames rose up and burnt his hut. Deciding that the company of the wicked was dangerous, he put out the fire and went up into the mountains. There he saw a hind licking the faces of a lion, a tiger, and a panther. Nothing is better than good friends thought the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to show the uselessness of tending the sacred fire. J.ii.41f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Outside the city gate was a cripple, who lived under a banyan tree, so clever that he could cut the leaves of the tree into various shapes by throwing stones at them. The king, seeing him, engaged his services to cure his chaplain. The cripple obtained a peashooter filled with dry goat's dung, and, sitting behind a curtain with a hole in it, he shot pellets of dung into the mouth of the chaplain as he talked away ceaselessly. When half a peck had thus been shot, the king revealed the plot to the chaplain and advised an emetic. The chaplain realized his folly and did not offend again. The cripple was given four villages, bringing in four thousand a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a novice on the banks of the Aciravatí who, challenged by his companions, shot a pebble through the eye of a swan in flight, the pebble emerging through the other eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novice is identified with the cripple and Ananda, with the king.

Sangharakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a wealthy family of Sávatthi, and, after joining the Order, lived with another monk in a forest tract, meditating. Near them a doe had given birth in a thicket to a fawn. While she tended it, her love kept her always near it, and she was famished for lack of grass and water. On seeing her, the Thera repeated: &quot;Alas! this world suffers, bound in bonds of craving,&quot; and with this as his incentive, he developed insight and won arahantship. Seeing his companion cherish wrong thoughts, the Thera admonished him in a verse, (Thag.vs.109) and he, too, became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety four kappas ago, Sangharakkhita saw seven Pacceka Buddhas at the foot of a rock and offered them kadamba flowers. Ninety two kappas ago he was king seven times, under the name of Phulla (ThagA.i.216f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Kadambapupphiya of the Apadána.

Amanda gives the news to the Buddha, who asks if there be any difference of opinion among monks regarding the Buddha's teaching. &quot;No,&quot; answers Ananda, but adds that such differences may arise after the Buddha's death. The Buddha says that quarrels regarding rigours of regimen or of the Vinaya are of little concern. It is quarrels regarding the Path or the course of training that are really important. He then explains the six causes from which disputes grow, the four adjudications (adhikarana) regarding disputes, and the seven settlements of adjudication -  by giving a summary verdict in the presence of the parties, a verdict of innocence, of past </data>

Then there are six things which lead to conciliations: acts of love, words of love, sharing equally whatever gifts one receives, strict practice of virtue without flaw or blemish, and the holding of noble views which make for salvation (M.ii.243 51; cf. the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasadika_sutta')"&gt;Pásadika Sutta&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; adds (MA.ii.840) that, while in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambiya')"&gt;Kosambiya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; the Sotápattimagga is called sammáditthi, in this sutta, Sotápattiphala itself is so called.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2  Sámagáma Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha was once staying near the lotus pond at Sámagáma and late at night is visited by a deva. After saluting the Buddha, he states that there are three things which lead to a monk's failure:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;delight in worldly activity&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;delight in talk&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;delight in sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So saying, he departs. The next day the Buddha relates to the monks the Deva's statement and adds three other things which lead to failure: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;delight in company&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;evil speaking&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;friendship with bad men.

There the Buddha and his monks were entertained to a meal, at the end of which the Buddha preached the Jará Sutta. Both the brahmin and his wife became Sakadágámins. When the Buddha returned to Añjanavana, the monks asked him what the brahmin had meant by calling him his son. The Buddha told them how the brahmin had been his father in five hundred successive past births, his uncle in a like number, and his grandfather in another five hundred. The brahmin's wife had similarly been his mother, his aunt, and his grandmother. J.i.308f; cf. DhA.iii.317f.; SNA.ii.532f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sáketa Játaka (No. 237). &lt;/b&gt;The story of the present is the same as in Játaka (1) above. When the Buddha returned to the monastery he was asked how the brahmin had recognized him. He explained how' in those who have loved in previous lives, love springs afresh, like lotus in the pond. J.i.234f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáketa Sutta. The Buddha explains to the monks at Sáketa how it is possible to reckon the five indriyas as the five balas and the five balas as the five indriyas. By developing the five indriyas, release can be attained. S.v.219f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day a cowherd left behind, inadvertently, a cow which was in calf, and a friendship sprang up between her and a lioness. The cow bore a calf and the lioness a cub, and these two young ones became Playmates. A forester seeing them together, reported the matter to the king, who wished to be informed should a third animal appear on the scene. A jackal, seeing the calf and the cub, and hoping for food, became friendly with them, and soon managed to make them quarrel. The king was informed of this, and by the time he arrived on the scene the two animals were dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to the Chabbaggiyá as a warning against their habit of back biting (J.iii.149ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the story referred to as the Sanghabheda Játaka (J.iii.211).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Having listened to a sermon on impermanence, after coming of age, he joined the Order and attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty one kappas ago, in the time of Sikhí Buddha, he was a cowherd. After the death of the Buddha he heard a monk preach on his virtues, and, acquiring discernment of impermanence, he paid great honour to the Buddha's bodhi tree. In his last life he recalled this act with great joy, as having helped him to win the goal. Thag.vs.217f.; ThagA.i.337f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There was very close relationship between Ceylon and Siam from the middle ages. For details see J.R.A.S. (Ceylon) xxxii.190ff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Buddhism fell on evil days in Ceylon, the kings of that Island turned to Siam for help in the restoration of the Faith. Kittisirirájásíha obtained copies of the Mahávamsa from Siam and completed the chronicle down to his day (Cv.xcix.78f). With the help of the Olandá (Dutch), he sent an embassy to Ayojjhá -  capital of Dhammika, king of Siam -  asking that a chapter of monks might be sent to Ceylon. Ten monks were sent, with Upáli and Ariyamuni at their head, together with many books and other gifts. The monks took up their residence in the Puppháráma in Sirivaddhanapura (Kandy), and, under the king's patronage, the ceremony of ordination was held on the 2296th year after the Buddha's death, on the full moon day of Ashálha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some time later, Dhammika again sent a chapter led by Visuddhácariya and Varañánamuni. As a token of his gratitude, Kittisirirájasíha sent to Dhammika a model of the Buddha's Tooth Relic in Kandy, together with various other gifts. Dhammika returned his courtesy by sending various books not to be found in Ceylon, a replica of the Buddha's footprint found on the Saccabaddha Mountain, etc. Cv.c.63ff., 136 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Satthikúta(sahassa)peta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was once a cripple in Benares adept in throwing stones. He lived at the city gate, under a banyan tree, and cut the leaves of the tree into different shapes for children who gave him some of their food. One day, the king discovered his skill and engaged his services to throw a pint pot of goat's dung into the mouth of a brahmin who never stopped talking. The cripple sat behind a curtain through which he threw the pellets of dung as the brahmin talked. Then the king told the brahmin, and he was cured of his talking and the cripple won great wealth. Desiring gain, a certain man ministered to the cripple and learnt his art, and, when he left, the cripple warned him not to throw stones at anyone who had father or mother or owner. While wandering about, the man came across the Pacceka Buddha Sunetta, and, thinking him a fit victim, threw a stone through his ear. The Pacceka Buddha suffered great pain and died. When it was discovered, the man was killed and was reborn in Avíci. Later he became a pets, on Gijjhakúta and Moggallána saw him going through the air, while sixty thousand blazing hammers rose and fell on his head. Pv.iv.16; PvA.282 6; DhA.ii.68 ff; cf. J.i.418f.

(DA.i.15). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nikáya is divided into five main Vaggas and fifty six sections, called Samyuttas, each Samyutta being again subdivided into minor Vaggas or chapters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a Commentary on the Samyutta, called Sáratthappakásiní. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya is quoted in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/milindapanha')"&gt;Milinda-Pañha&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the Samyuttas, the Anamatagga, was preached by Rakkhita in Vanavása (Mhv.xii.32) and by Mahinda in Ceylon (Mhv.xv.186), soon after their respective arrivals in these countries, at the conclusion of the Third Council.

They lived at first in the Dakkhina vihára, but later went to the Jetavana vihára, built by Mahásena. They made certain alterations in the Ubhatovibhanga (MT.175, 176; Cf. Sás.p.24; see also Mhv.xxxvii.32 ff., and MT.680). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Singhalese Nikáyasangrahaya (Quoted in Geiger's Dípavamsa and Mahávamsa, p.90), the Ságalikas took their name from their leader, Ságala Thera, and their separation took place seven hundred and ninety five years after the Buddha's death, in the reign of King Gothábhaya. Moggallána I. gave the viháras of Dalha and Dáthákondañña, on Síhagiri, to the Dhammarucikas and the Ságalikas, while he also gave the Rájiní nunnery for the use of the nuns of the Ságalika sect (Cv.xxxix.41, 43). Aggabodhi II. gave the Veluvana vihára, which he had built, to the Ságalikas (Cv.xlii.43). Kassapa IV. built for them the Kassapasenavihára. Cv.lii.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He succeeded Sanghatissa and set up a saláká house in the Mahávihára. He was a very good king, and made rain fall by virtue of his goodness. He quelled the Yakkha Rattakkhi, who devastated his territory. When his treasurer, Gothakábhaya, rose in revolt, he abdicated in his favour and became an ascetic. Later, he gave his head in gratitude to a poor man who gave him a meal, so that the man could win from the king the price which had been set on his head. (Mhv.xxxvi.73ff.; Dpv.xxii.53f ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legend of the king surrendering his head is famous in Ceylon, and forms the theme of a Páli Chronicle, the Hatthavanagallaviháravamsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sanankumára&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mahá Brahmá. In the Nikáyas (D.i.121; M.i.358; S.i.153; A.v.327) he is mentioned as the author of a famous verse, there quoted:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;dl&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;Khattiyo settho jane tasmim ye gottapatisárino   &lt;/dd&gt;  &lt;dd&gt;Vijjácaranasampanno so settho devamánuse.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one place (S.ii.284) the verse is attributed to the Buddha, thus endowing it with the authoritativeness of a pronouncement by the Buddha himself. Sanankumára is represented as a very devout follower of the Buddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sutta of the Samyutta (S.i.153), he is spoken of as visiting the Buddha on the banks of the Sappiní, and it was during this visit that the above verse was spoken. Sanankumára was present at the preaching of the Mahásamaya Sutta (D.ii.261). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Janavasabha Sutta, Janavasabha describes to the Buddha an occasion on which Sanankumára attended an assembly of the Devas, presided over by Sakka and the Four Regent Gods. There was suddenly a vast radiance, and the devas knew of the approach of Sanankumára. As the usual appearance of the Brahmá is not sufficiently materialized for him to be perceived by the Devas of Távatimsa, he is forced to appear as a relatively gross personality which he specially creates. As he arrives, the Devas sit in their places with clasped hands waiting for him to choose his seat. Then Sanankumára takes on the form of Pañcasikha (because all devas like Pañcasikha, says the Commentary, DA.ii.640) and sits, above the assembly, cross legged, in the air. So seated, he expresses his satisfaction that Sakka and all the Távatimsa Devas should honour and follow the Buddha. His voice has all the eight characteristics of a Brahmá's voice. (These are given at D.ii.211). He then proceeds to create thirty three shaper, of himself, each sitting on the divan of </data>
<data>a Távatimsa Deva, and addresses the Devas, speaking of the advantages of taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. Each deva fancies that only the shape sitting on his own divan has spoken and that the others are silent. Then Sanankumára goes to the end of the Hall, and, seated on Sakka's throne, addresses the whole assembly on the four ways of iddhi; on the three avenues leading to Bliss, as manifested by the Buddha; on the four satipatthánas, and the seven samádhiparikkhárá. He declares that more than twenty four lakhs of Magadha disciples, having followed the teachings of the Buddha, have been born in the deva worlds. When Sanankumára has finished his address, Vessavana wonders if there have been Buddhas in the past and will be in the future. The Brahmá reads his thoughts and says there certainly were and will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanankumára means &quot;ever young.&quot; Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.584; cf. SA.i.171) that, in his former birth, he practised jhánas while yet a boy with his hair tied in five knots (pañcacúlakakumárakále), and was reborn in the Brahma world with the thána intact. He liked the guise of youth and continued in the same, hence the name. Rhys Davids (Dial.ii.292, n.3; cf.i.121, n.1) sees in the legend of Sanankumára the Indian counterpart of the European legend of Galahad. The oldest mention of it is in the Chándogya Upanisad (Chap. VII), where the ideal, yet saintly knight, teaches a typical brahmin the highest truths. In the Mahábhárata (iii.185, Bombay Edition) he expresses a sentiment very similar to that expressed in the stanza quoted above. In mediaeval literature he is said to have been one of five or seven mind born sons of Brahma who remained pure and innocent. A later and debased Jaina version of the legend tells in detail of the love adventures and wives of this knight, with a few words at the end on his conversion to the saintly life. See </data>

The Buddha approves of the sentiment contained in the verse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The quail lamented, saying that if he had remained in the feeding ground of his own people he would not have suffered thus. The falcon, hearing this, let him go, saying that he could catch him, no matter where he was. The quail flew back and perched on an immense clod, whence he called to the falcon. The falcon swooped down, but the quail just turned over, and the falcon was dashed to pieces against the clod.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sánu Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in a family of Sávatthi after his father had left home for the ascetic life. The mother, naming him Sánu, took him at the age of seven to the monks for ordination, thinking thus to ensure for him supreme happiness. He was known as Sánu (Sánu Sámanera) the Novice, and became a very learned teacher of the doctrine, practising the meditation of love (mettá), and was popular among gods and men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother in a previous birth was a Yakkha. Later, Sánu lost his intellectual discernment and grew distraught and longed to go roaming. His former Yakkha mother seeing this, warned his human mother as described in the Sánu Sutta (q.v.). The latter was overwhelmed with grief, and, when Sánu visited her, he found her weeping. She told him that he was as good as dead in that he had rejected the Buddha's teaching and turned again to lower things, hence her sorrow. Sánu was filled with anguish, and, strengthening his insight, he soon won arahantship (ThagA.i.113f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Udakadáyaka of the Apadána (Ap.i.205). In the past, he saw Siddhattha Buddha having his meal and brought him water for his hands and feet and face and mouth. Sixty one kappas ago he was a king, named Vimala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Sánu is given also in the Samyutta and Dhammapada Commentaries (SA.i.235ff.; DhA.iv.18ff), but the details differ. There, Sánu's human mother is portrayed as encouraging him to return to the lay life. His Yakkha-mother went to his human mother's home, where Sánu was waiting for a meal, took possession of his body, twisted his neck, and felled him to the ground, where he lay foaming at the mouth. Sánu's mother was filled with despair. The Yakkhiní then revealed herself and exhorted Sánu not to behave </data>
<data>foolishly by disregarding the Buddha's teaching. When he regained his senses, his human mother, too, pointed out the disadvantages of household life. When he declared his intention of not returning to lay life, she fed him with choice food and gave him a set of three robes that he might receive the upasampadá ordination. He then sought the Buddha, who urged him to fresh and strenuous effort. Sánu was famous as a mighty teacher throughout Jambudípa. He lived to one hundred and twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sahampati&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mahábrahmá. When the Buddha was at the Ajapálanigrodha, hesitating as to whether or not he should preach the Dhamma, Sahampati appeared before him and begged of him to open to the world the doors of Immortality. The Buddha agreed to this urgent request (Vin.i.5f.;S.i.137f), and accepted from Sahampati the assurance that all the Buddhas of the past had also had no other teacher than the Dhamma discovered by them. S.i.139; see also S.v.167f.,185, 232, where he gives the same assurance to the Buddha regarding the four satipatthánas and the five indriyas; A.ii.10f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa (E.g., SA.i.155) explains that the Buddha was reluctant to preach, not on account of indolence, but because he wished Sahampati to make him this request. For, thought the Buddha, the world honours Brahmá greatly, and when people realized that Brahmá himself had begged of the Buddha to spread his teaching, they would pay more attention to it. Sahampati was, at this time, the most senior of the Brahmás (jettha-Mahábrahmá) (DA.ii.467).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sahampati once saw that the brahminee, mother of Brahmadeva Thera, habitually made offerings to Brahmá. Out of compassion for her, Sahampati appeared before her and exhorted her to give her offerings to Brahmadeva instead (S.i.140f). On another occasion, when Kokáliya died and was born in Padumaniraya, Sahampati appeared before the Buddha and announced the fact to him (SN. p.125; cp. S.i.151; A.v.172). The Samyutta (S.i.154f) contains a series of verses spoken by Sahampati at Andhakavinda, when the Buddha sat out in the open during the night and rain fell drop by drop. The verses are in praise of the life and practices of the monks and of the results thereof. Sahampati again visited the Buddha, simultaneously with Sakka, and as they stood </data>
<data>leaning against a doorpost of the Buddha's cell, Sakka uttered a verse in praise of the Buddha. Sahampati then added another verse, exhorting the Buddha to preach the Doctrine, as there were those who would understand (S.i.233). A verse spoken by him immediately after the Buddha's death is included in the books (D.ii.157; S.i.158).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the time of Kassapa Buddha, Sahampati was a monk, named Sahaka, who, having practised the five indriyas (saddhá, etc.), was reborn in the Brahma world. Thereafter he was called Sahampati (S.v.233). The Commentaries say (SNA.ii.476; SA.i.155) that he was an Anágámí Brahmá born in the Suddhávásá, there to pass a whole kappa, because he had developed the first Jhána as a monk. The Buddhavamsa, Commentary (BuA.p.11; see also p.29) says that, strictly speaking, his name should be &quot;Sahakapati.&quot; When the Buddha attained Enlightenment, Sahampati held over the Buddha's head a white parasol three yojanas in diameter. BuA.239; this incident was sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxx.74); cp. J.iv.266. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he offered to the Buddha a chain of jewels (ratanadáma) as large as Sineru (KhA.171; Sp.i.115; Vsm.201). On the day that Alindakavási Maháphussadeva attained arahantship, Sahampati came to wait upon him (VibhA.352).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested (VT.i.86, n.1) that Brahmá Sahampati is very probably connected with Brahmi Svayambhú of brahmanical literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, as she was giving the five products of the cow to a company of twenty thousand monks, she persuaded them to accept her gifts even when they covered their bowls, saying: &quot;Enough, enough.&quot; For this reason, when, as Visákhá, she was given cattle by her father at the time of her marriage, other herds of cattle joined them, in spite of the efforts of men to prevent them (DhA.i.396f., 418).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána, however, gives her name as Sanghadáyiká. Ap.ii.655 (vs. 16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Sanghadásí.&lt;/b&gt; An eminent nun of Jambudípa. Dpv.xviii.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sámávatí&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the three chief consorts of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the daughter of the setthi &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddavatiya')"&gt;Bhaddavatiya&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddavatii')"&gt;Bhaddavatí&lt;/a&gt;, who was a friend of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghosaka_setthi')"&gt;Ghosaka&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambí&lt;/a&gt;. When plague broke out in Bhaddavatí, she and her parents fled to Kosambí, and there obtained food from the alms hall provided by Ghosaka. On the first day Sámávatí asked for three portions, on the second two, on the third only one. For her father had died after the meal on the first day, her mother on the second. When, on the third day, she asked for only one portion, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mitta')"&gt;Mitta&lt;/a&gt; who was distributing alms, teased her, saying: &quot;Today you know the capacity of your belly.&quot; She asked what he meant, and when he explained his words, she told him what had happened. Mitta pitied her and adopted her as his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, when she arrived at the refectory, she found a great uproar going on, people rushing everywhere to get alms. She asked to be allowed to bring order into this chaos, and had a fence erected round the refectory with separate doors for entrance and exit. This put an end to the disturbances. Ghosaka, hearing no noise in the refectory as before, inquired the reason, and, finding out what Sámávatí had done, adopted her as his own child. Sámávatí's original name was Sámá, but after building the fence (vati) round the refectory she was called Sámávatí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a festival day Udena saw Sámávatí going to the river to bathe, and, falling in love with her, asked Ghosaka to send her to the palace. </data>
<data>But Ghosaka refused, and the king turned him and his wife out of doors and sealed up his house. When Sámávatí discovered this, she made Ghosaka send her to the palace, and Udena made her his chief consort. Some time afterwards Udena took &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiyaa')"&gt;Mágandiyá&lt;/a&gt; also as consort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; visited Kosambí at the request of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghosaka_setthi')"&gt;Ghosaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kukkuta')"&gt;Kukkuta&lt;/a&gt; and Páváriya, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khujjuttaraa')"&gt;Khujjutará&lt;/a&gt;, the servant woman of Sámávatí, heard him preach and became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;Sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. She had been on her way to the gardener, Sumana, to buy flowers for Sámávatí, with the eight pieces of money given to her daily by the king for this purpose. On Sumana's invitation, she had gone to hear the Buddha at his house. On other days she had spent only half the money on flowers, appropriating the rest for herself; but this day, having become a Sotápanna, she bought flowers with the whole amount and took them to Sámávatí, to whom she confessed her story. At Sámávatí's request, Khujjuttará repeated to her and her companions the sermon she had heard from the Buddha. After this, she visited the Buddha daily, repeating his sermon to Sámávatí and her friends. Having learnt that the Buddha passed along the street in which the palace stood, Sámávatí had holes made in the walls so that she and her friends might see the Buddha and do obeisance to him. Mágandiyá heard of this during a visit to Sámávatí's quarters, and, because of her hatred for the Buddha, she determined to have Sámávatí punished. For details see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiyaa')"&gt;Mágandiyá&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first her plots miscarried, and Udena, convinced of </data>
<data>Sámávatí's goodness, gave her a boon, and she chose that the Buddha be invited to visit the palace daily and to preach to her and her friends. But the Buddha sent &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; instead, and they provided him with food every day and listened to the Law. One day they presented him with five hundred robes given to them by the king, who, at first, was very angry; but on hearing from Ananda that nothing given to the monks was lost, he gave another five hundred robes himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Mágandiyá's plot succeeded, and Sámávatí and her companions were burned to death in their own house. Udena was in his park, and, on his arrival, he found them all dead. When the Buddha was asked, he said that sonic of the women had attained to the First Fruit of the Path, others to the second, yet others to the third. It is said that in a previous birth Sámávatí and her friends had belonged to the harem of the king of Benares. One day they went bathing with the king, and, feeling cold when they came out of the water, they set fire to a tangle of grass, near by. When the grass burned down, they found a Pacceka Buddha seated in the tangle, and fearing that they had burnt him to death, they pulled more grass, which they placed round his body, and, after pouring oil on it, set fire to it so that all traces of their crime might be destroyed. The Pacceka Buddha was in samádhi and nothing could therefore harm him, but it was this act which brought retribution to Sámávatí and her companions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Sámávatí is included in the story cycle of Udena. For details see especially DhA.i.187 91, 205 225; the story also appears, with certain variations in detail, in AA.i.232 4, 236ff., and is given very briefly in UdA.382f., omitting the account of the reason for Sámávatí's death which is given at length in an explanation of an &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udaana')"&gt;Udána&lt;/a&gt; (Ud.vii.10) dealing with </data>
<data>the incident. Cf. Dvy.575f. According to the Visuddhi Magga (p.380f), Mágandiyá's desire to kill Sámávatí arose from her desire to be herself chief queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two Therí's named &lt;a href="samaa')"&gt;Sámá&lt;/a&gt; were friends of Sámávatí, and were so filled with grief over her death that they left home and joined the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sámávatí is reckoned among the moist eminent of the lay women who were followers of the Buddha, and was declared by him foremost among those who lived in kindliness (aggam mettávihárinam) (A.i.26; cf. iv.348).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her iddhi, in warding off the arrow shot at her by Udena, is often referred to. E.g. BuA.24; ItA.23; PSA.498; AA.ii.791.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When he came of age his father handed over the kingdom to him, became an ascetic, and lived in the royal park. There Duyyodhana frequently visited him; finding this inconvenient, the ascetic went to Mahimsakarattha and lived in a hut on a bend of the Kannapenná River, which flows from the Sankhapála Lake near Mount Candaka. There he was visited by the Nága king Sankhapála, to whom he preached the Dhamma. Later, Duyyodhana discovered the whereabouts of the ascetic and visited him. There he saw the Nága-king, and, impressed by his great magnificence, desired to visit the Nága-world. On his return to the capital, Duyyodhana engaged in works of merit, and was born after death in the Nága world and became its king under the name of Sankhapála. In course of time, he grew weary of his magnificence, and, leaving the Nága world, lived near the Kannapenná, on an ant hill, keeping the holy fast. As he lay there, sixteen men, roaming in the forest, saw him and seized him. They drove stakes into his body, and made holes in the stakes and fastened ropes to them in order to drag him along. But Sankhapála showed no resentment. A landowner of Mithilá, called Alára, saw him being ill treated and had him released. Thereupon, Sankhapála invited Alára to the Nága world, and Alára lived there for one year. He later became an ascetic, and, in due course, visited Benares, where he told the king the story of his visit to the Nága world. After the rains he returned to the Himálaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to some laymen who kept the fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta's father is identified with Mahá Kassapa, the king of Benares with Ananda, and Alára with Sáriputta. J.v.161 71. See also </data>

He entered the Order and attained arahantship in the Tonsure hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha he spent all his wealth in good deeds and was left poor. Even then he continued to wait on the Buddha and his monks and led a good life. Eight kappas ago he was a king named Sucintita. (Thag.vs.48; ThagA.i.119f ).

The Buddha sent for her and told her of seven kinds of wives in the world   the slayer, the robber, the mistress, the mother, the sister, the companion, the handmaid   and described their qualities. Sujátá, much impressed, said that henceforth she would be a handmaid (A.iv.91f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says (AA.ii.724) that she was established in the Refuges; but see Sujátá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He will raise up again the palace of King Mahápanáda and live there. But later he will give it to the Order and become an arahant. D.iii.75f.; Anágat. p. 42 (vs. 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentary (DA.iii.856), he was one of two cane workers (nalakárá), father and son, who made a hut for a Pacceka Buddha. After death, both were born in heaven. The son became &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapanaada')"&gt;Mahápanáda&lt;/a&gt;, and, later, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddaji_th')"&gt;Bhaddaji&lt;/a&gt;.

The king entrusted him with the celebrations in connection with the upanayana ceremony of Parakkamabáhu (afterwards Parakkamabáhu I.). When Parakkamabáhu returned to Badalatthalí in his tour of preparation, Sankha welcomed him and paid him all honour. But Parakkamabáhu proved treacherous and had him slain.

Sabbamitta Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a brahmin family of Sávatthi, and entered the Order after seeing the Buddha's acceptance of Jetavana. He dwelt in the forest, meditating. Once, on his way to Sávatthi to worship the Buddha, he saw a fawn caught in a trapper's net. The doe, though not in the net, remained near, out of love for her young, yet not daring to approach the snare. The Thera was much moved by the thought of all the suffering which was caused by love. Farther on he saw bandits wrapping in straw a man whom they had caught and were preparing to set on fire. The Thera was filled with anguish, and, developing insight, won arahantship. He uttered, in his anguish, the two verses included in Thag. 149 50. He preached to the bandits and they joined the Order under him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha, he was a hunter who lived on game. One day, the Buddha, out of compassion for him, left three of his footprints outside his hut. The hunter saw them, and, owing to good deeds done in the past, recognized them as the Buddha's, and offered to them koranda flowers. After death he was born in Távatimsa (ThagA.i.269f). His Apadána verses are given in two places under the name of Korandapupphiya (q.v.). Ap.ii.383, 434; cf. Sugandha Thera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sattamba, Sattambaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrine near Vesáli. (D.ii.102; Ud.vi.1; S.v.259; A.iv.309, etc.). It was so called because, in the past, seven princesses, daughters of Kiki, king of Benares, left Rájagaha and fought for attainment at that spot. It was originally dedicated to some deity, but after the Buddha's visit to Vesáli, it became a place of residence for him (UdA.323, etc.). It was to the west of Vesáli. D.iii.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sabbadátha Játaka (No. 241)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once chaplain to the king of Benares and knew a spell called Pathavíjaya (subduing the world). One day he retired to a lonely place and was reciting the spell. A jackal, hiding in a hole near by, overheard it and learned it by heart. When the Bodhisatta had finished his recital, the jackal appeared before him, and saying: &quot;Ho, brahmin, I have learnt your spell,&quot; ran away. The Bodhisatta chased him, but in vain. As a result of learning the spell, the jackal subdued all the creatures of the forest and became their king, under the name of Sabbadátha. On the back of two elephants stood a lion and on the lion's back sat Sabbadátha, with his consort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with pride, the jackal wished to capture Benares, and went with his army and besieged the city. The king was alarmed, but the Bodhisatta reassured him, and, having learnt from Sabbadátha that he proposed to capture the city by making the lions roar, gave orders to the inhabitants to stop their ears with flour. Then he mounted the watch tower and challenged Sabbadátha to carry out his threat. This Sabbadátha did, and even the lions on which he rode joined in the roar. The elephants were so terrified that, in their fright, they dropped Babbadátha, who was trampled to death. The carcases of the animals which died in the tumult covered twelve leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta’s attempts to injure the Buddha, which only resulted in working harm upon himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jackal is identified with Devadatta and the king with Ananda (J.ii.242 6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is referred to in the Milinda-Pañha (Mil. P. 202), and there the Bodhisatta's name is given as Vidhura. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sattigumba Játaka (No. 503)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two parrots were once carried away by the wind during the moulting season. One of them fell among the weapons in a robber village and was called Sattigumba; the other fell in a hermitage among flowers and was called Pupphaka. He was the Bodhisatta. One day, Pañcála, king of Uttarapañcála, went out hunting. While chasing the deer with his charioteer, he was separated from his bodyguard and found himself in a glen near the robbers' village. There he slept. The robbers were absent, leaving only Sattigumba and a cook, named Patikolamba. The parrot, seeing the king, plotted with the cook to kill him. The king overheard the plan and fled with his charioteer. In his flight he came to the hermitage, where he was made welcome by Pupphaka till the return of the sages. The king told his story, and Pupphaka explained that though he and Sattigumba were brothers, heir upbringing had been different, which accounted for the difference in their natures. The king decreed immunity to all parrots and provided for the comfort of sages in his park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's attempt to kill the Buddha by hurling a stone at him. Sattigamba is identified with Devadatta and the king with Ananda. J.iv.430 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sarabhanga Játaka (No. 522)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as the son of the purohita of the king of Benares. He was called Jotipála because, on the day of his birth, there was a blaze of all kinds of arms for a distance of twelve leagues round Benares. This showed that he would be the chief archer of all India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having been educated in Takkasilá, he returned to Benares and entered the king's service, receiving one thousand a day. When the king's attendants grumbled at this, the king ordered Jotipála to give an exhibition of his skill. This he did, in the presence of sixty thousand archers. With the bow and arrow he performed twelve unrivalled acts of skill and cleft seven hard substances. Then he drove an arrow through a furlong of water and two furlongs of earth and pierced a hair at a distance of half a furlong. The sun set at the conclusion of this exhibition, and the king promised to appoint him commander in chief the next day. But during the night, Jotipála felt a revulsion for the household life, and, departing unannounced, went into the Kapittha vana on the Godhávarí and there became an ascetic. On Sakka's orders, Vissakamma built a hermitage for him, in which he lived, developing great iddhi powers. When his parents and the king with his retinue visited him, he converted them to the ascetic life, and his followers soon numbered many thousands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had seven pupils   Sálissara, Mendissara, Pabbata, Káladevala, Kisavaccha, Anusissa and Nárada. When Kapitthavana became too crowded, Jotipála, now known as Sarabhanga, sent his pupils away to different parts of the country: Sálissara to Lambacúlaka, Mendissara to Sátodiká, Pabbata to Añjana Mountain, Káladevala to Ghanasela, Kisavaccha to Kumbhavatí and Nárada to Arañjara, while Anusissa remained with him. When Kisavaccha, </data>
<data>through the folly of a courtesan, was ill treated by King Dandakí of Kumbhavatí and his army, Sarabhanga heard from the king's commander in chief of this outrage and sent two of his pupils to bring Kisavaccha on a palanquin to the hermitage. There he died, and when his funeral was celebrated, for the space of half a league round his pyre there fell a shower of celestial flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the outrage committed on Kisavaccha, sixty leagues of Dandakí's kingdom were destroyed together with the king. When the news of this spread abroad, three kings   Kalinga, Atthaka and Bhimaratha   recalling stories of other similar punishments that had followed insults to holy men, went to visit Sarabhanga in order to get at the truth of the matter. They met on the banks of the Godhávarí, and there they were joined by Sakka. Sarabhanga sent Anusissa to greet them and offer them hospitality, and, when they had rested, gave them permission to put their questions. Sarabhanga explained to them how Dandaka, Nálikira, Ajjuna and Kalábu, were all born in hell owing to their ill-treatment of holy men, and went to expound to them the moral law. Even as he spoke the three kings were filled with the desire for renunciation, and at the end of Sarabhanga's discourse they became ascetics, under him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the death of Moggallána (q.v.). It is said that after Moggallána had been attacked by brigands and left by them for dead, he recovered consciousness, and, flying to the Buddha, obtained his consent to die. The six deva worlds were filled with great commotion, and, after his death, the devas brought offerings of flowers and incense to his pyre, which was made of sandalwood and ninety nine precious things. When the body was placed on the pyre flowers rained down for the space of one league round and for seven days there was a great festival. The Buddha </data>
<data>had the relics collected and deposited in a shrine in Veluvana. The Buddha identified Moggallána, with Kisavaccha and related this Játaka. Of the others, Sálissara was Sáriputta, Mendissara Kassapa, Pabbata Anuruddha, Devala Kaccáyana, and Anusissa Ananda. J.v.125 51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Sánu Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contains the conversation between Sánu's mother and the Yakkhiní, who possessed Sánu (see Sánu) in order to prevent him from &quot;losing his soul.&quot; Sánu's mother says she cannot understand how Yakkhas can possess holy men who keep the fasts and lead holy lives. The Yakkhiní says she is right; but holiness consists in refraining from evil, both open and secret. Sánu's mother understands, and, when her son regains consciousness and asks her why she weeps as he is not dead, she replies that he is as good as dead in that he wishes to return to the household life, like goods, which having been rescued from the fire, wish to be thrown into it once more.
