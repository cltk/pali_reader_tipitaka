He spoke as soon as he was born (Cf. BuA.228). On the same day was also born a white elephant named Paccaya. At the age of eight, Vessantara wished to make a great gift and the earth trembled. He married Madd\u00ed at the age of sixteen, and their children were J\u00e1li and Kanhajin\u00e1.</p><p>At that time there was a great drought in K\u00e1linga, and eight brahmins came from there to Vessantara to beg his white elephant, which had the power of making rain to fall. He granted their request, and gave the elephant together with its priceless trappings (J.vi.488f. gives the details of these). The citizens of Jetuttara were greatly upset that their elephant should have been given away, and demanded of Sa\u00f1jaya that Vessantara should be banished to Vankagiri. The will of the people prevailed, and Vessantara was asked to take the road along which those travel who have offended. He agreed to go, but before setting out, obtained the king's leave to hold an almsgiving called the \"Gift of the Seven Hundreds\" (Sattasataka), in which he gave away seven hundred of each kind of thing. People came from all over Jambud\u00edpa to accept his gifts, and the almsgiving lasted for a whole day.</p><p>When Vessantara took leave of his parents and prepared for his journey, Madd\u00ed insisted on accompanying him with her two children. They were conveyed in a gorgeous carriage drawn by four horses, but, outside the city, Vessantara met four brahmins who begged his horses. Four devas then drew the chariot, but another brahmin soon appeared and obtained the chariot.", "Thenceforward they travelled on foot, through Suvannagirit\u00e1la, across the river Kantim\u00e1r\u00e1, to beyond Mount Ara\u00f1jaragiri and Dunnivittha, to his uncle's city, in the kingdom of Ceta. The devas shortened the way for them, and the trees lowered their fruit that they might eat. Sixty thousand khattiyas came out to welcome Vessantara and offered him their kingdom, which, however, he refused. He would not even enter the city, but remained outside the gates, and, when he left early the next morning, the people of Ceta, led by Cetaputta, went with him for fifteen leagues, till they came to the entrance to the forest. Vessantara and his family then proceeded to Gandham\u00e1dana, northwards, by the foot of Mount Vipula to the river Ketumat\u00ed, where a forester entertained them and gave them to eat. Thence they crossed the river to beyond N\u00e1lika, along the bank of Lake Mucalinda, to its north eastern corner, then along a narrow footpath into the dense forest, to Vankagiri. There Vissakamma had already built two hermitages, by order of Sakka, one for Vessantara and one for Madd\u00ed and the children, and there they took up their residence. By Vessantara's power, the wild animals to a distance of three leagues became gentle. Madd\u00ed rose daily at dawn, and, having fetched water to wash, went into the forest for yams and fruit. In the evening she returned, washed the children, and the family sat down to eat. Thus passed four months.</p><p>Then from Dunnivittha there came to the hermitage an old brahmin, called J\u00fajaka, who had been sent by his young wife, Amittat\u00e1pan\u00e1, to find slaves for her, because when she went to the well for water the other women had laughed at her, calling her \"old man's darling.\" She told J\u00fajaka that he could easily get Vessantara's children as slaves, and so he came to Vankagiri. Asking the way of various people, including the hermit Accuta, J\u00fajaka arrived at", "Vankagiri late in the evening and spent the night on the hilltop. That night Madd\u00ed had a dream, and, being terrified, she sought Vessantara. He knew what the dream presaged, but consoled her and sent her away the next day in search of food. During her absence, J\u00fajaka came and made his request. He would not await the return of Madd\u00ed, and Vessantara willingly gave him the two children. But they ran away and hid in a pond till told by their father to go with J\u00fajaka. When Vessantara poured water on J\u00fajaka's hand as a symbol of his gift, the earth trembled with joy. Once more the children escaped and ran back to their father, but he strengthened his resolve with tears in his eyes. J\u00fajaka led the children away, beating them along the road till their blood flowed.</p><p>It was late in the evening when Madd\u00ed returned because devas, assuming the form of beasts of prey, delayed her coming, lest she should stand in the way of Vessantara's gift. In answer to her questions, Vessantara spoke no word, and she spent the night searching for the children. In the morning she returned to the hermitage and fell down fainting. Vessantara restored her to consciousness and told her of what had happened, explaining why he had not told her earlier. When she had heard his story she expressed her joy, affirming that he had made a noble gift for the sake of omniscience.</p><p>And then, lest some vile creature should come and ask for Madd\u00ed, Sakka, assuming the form of a brahmin, appeared and asked for her Vessantara looked at Madd\u00ed, and she expressed her consent. So he gave Madd\u00ed to the brahmin, and the earth trembled. Sakka revealed his identity, gave Madd\u00ed back to Vessantara, and allowed him eight boons. Vessantara asked that </p><ul>  <li>(1) he be recalled to his father's city, </li>  <li>(2) he should condemn no man to death, </li>", "<li>(3) he should be a helpmate to all alike </li>  <li>(4) he should not be guilty of adultery, </li>  <li>(5) his son should have long life: </li>  <li>(6) he should have celestial food, </li>  <li>(7) his means of giving should never fail, </li>  <li>(8) after death he should be reborn in heaven.</li></ul><p>In the meantime, J\u00fajaka had travelled sixty leagues with the children, whom the devas cared for and protected. Guided by the devas, they arrived in fifteen days at Jetuttara, though J\u00fajaka had intended to go to K\u00e1linga. Sa\u00f1jaya bought the children from J\u00fajaka, paying a high price, including the gift of a seven storeyed palace. But J\u00fajaka died of over eating, and as no relation of his could be traced, his possessions came back to the king. Sa\u00f1jaya ordered his army to be prepared and a road to be built from Jetuttara to Vankagiri, eight usabhas wide. Seven days later, led by J\u00e1li, Sa\u00f1jaya and Phusat\u00ed started for Vankagiri.</p><p>In the army was the white elephant, who had been returned because the people of K\u00e1linga could not maintain him. There was great rejoicing at the reunion of the family, and the six royal personages fell in a swoon till they were revived by rain sent by Sakka, the rain only wetting those who so wished it. Vessantara was crowned king of Sivi, with Madd\u00ed as his consort. After a month's merry making in the forest, they returned to Jetuttara. On the day Vessantara entered the city he set free every captive, including even cats. In the evening, as he lay wondering how he would be able to satisfy his suitors the next day, Sakka's throne was heated, and he sent down a shower of the seven kinds of precious things, till the palace grounds were filled waist high. Vessantara was thus able to practise his generosity to the end of his days.", "After death he was born in Tusita (J.i.47; DhA.i.69).</p><p>The story was related on the occasion of the Buddha's first visit to Kapilavatthu. The Buddha's kinsmen escorted him to the Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma, but sat round him without doing any obeisance, because of their great pride. The Buddha then performed the Twin Miracle, and the S\u00e1kyans, led by<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana')\">Suddhodana</a>, worshipped him. There was then a shower of rain, refreshing all and falling only on those who so wished. When the people expressed their wonder, the Buddha related this story, showing that in the past, too, rain had fallen on his kinsfolk to revive them. (According to BuA.245, the J\u00e1taka was related at the end of the recital of the Buddhavamsa).</p><ul>  <li>Devadatta is identified with J\u00fajaka, </li>  <li>Cinc\u00e1 with Amittat\u00e1pan\u00e1, </li>  <li>Channa with Cetaputta, </li>  <li>S\u00e1riputta with Accuta, </li>  <li>Anuruddha with Sakka, </li>  <li>Sa\u00f1jaya with Suddhodana, </li>  <li>Mah\u00e1m\u00e1y\u00e1 with Phusat\u00ed, </li>  <li>R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1 with Madd\u00ed, </li>  <li>R\u00e1hula with J\u00e1li, and </li>  <li>Uppalavanna with Kanhajin\u00e1.

There came a shortage in the food supply owing to drought, and people died in large numbers. The smell of decaying bodies attracted evil spirits, and many inhabitants were attacked by intestinal disease. The people complained to the ruling prince, and he convoked a general assembly, where it was decided, after much discussion, to invite the Buddha to their city. As the Buddha was then at Veluvana in R\u00e1jagaha, the Licchavi Mah\u00e1li, friend of Bimbis\u00e1ra and son of the chaplain of Ves\u00e1li, was sent to Bimbis\u00e1ra with a request that he should persuade the Buddha to go to Ves\u00e1li. Bimbis\u00e1ra referred him to the Buddha himself, who, after listening to Mah\u00e1li's story, agreed to go. The Buddha started on the journey with five hundred monks. Bimbis\u00e1ra decorated the route from R\u00e1jagaha to the Ganges, a distance of five leagues, and provided all comforts on the way. He accompanied the Buddha, and the Ganges was reached in five days. Boats, decked with great splendour, were ready for the Buddha and his monks, and we are told that Bimbis\u00e1ra followed the Buddha into the water up to his neck. The Buddha was received on the opposite bank by the Licchavis, with even greater honour than Bimbis\u00e1ra had shown him. As soon as the Buddha set foot in the Vajjian territory, there was a thunderstorm and rain fell in torrents. The distance from the Ganges to Ves\u00e1li was three leagues; as the Buddha approached Ves\u00e1li, Sakka", "came to greet him, and, at the sight of the devas, all the evil spirits fled in fear. In the evening the Buddha taught Ananda the Ratana Sutta, and ordered that it should be recited within the three walls of the city, the round of the city being made with the Licchavi princes. This Ananda did during the three watches of the night, and all the pestilences of the citizens disappeared. The Buddha himself recited the Ratana Sutta to the assembled people, and eighty four thousand beings were converted. After repeating this for seven consecutive days, the Buddha left Ves\u00e1li. (According to the DhA. account the Buddha stayed only seven days in Ves\u00e1li; KhA. says two weeks). The Licchavis accompanied him to the Ganges with redoubled honours, and, in the river itself, Devas and N\u00e1gas vied with each other in paying him honour.

On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ananda to C\u00e1p\u00e1la cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ananda of the beauties of Ves\u00e1li: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the S\u00e1randada cetiya. Cf. Mtu.i.300, where a Kapinayha-cetiya is also mentioned. All these were once shrines dedicated to various local deities, but after the Buddha's visit to Ves\u00e1li, they were converted into places of Buddhist worship. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Ves\u00e1li   e.g., P\u00e1tik\u00e1r\u00e1ma, V\u00e1lik\u00e1r\u00e1ma.</p><p>The Buddha generally stayed at the K\u00fat\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1 (q.v.) during his visits to Ves\u00e1li, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines (See D.ii.118). During his last visit to the C\u00e1p\u00e1la cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed M\u00e1ra and, later, Ananda, of his decision. The next day he left Ves\u00e1li for Bhandag\u00e1ma, after taking one last look at the city, \"turning his whole body round, like an elephant\" (n\u00e1g\u00e1palokitam apaloketv\u00e1) (D.ii.122). The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent", "at Beluvag\u00e1ma, a suburb of Ves\u00e1li, while the monks stayed in and around Ves\u00e1li. On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambap\u00e1li invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order (D.ii.98; but see Dial.ii.102, n.1).</p><p>Ves\u00e1li was a stronghold of the Niganthas, and it is said that of the forty two rainy seasons of the latter part of Mah\u00e1v\u00edra's ascetic life, he passed twelve at Ves\u00e1li. Jacobi: Jaina Sutras (S.B.E.) Kalpa S\u00fatra, sect. 122; Ves\u00e1li was also the residence of Kandaramasuka and P\u00e1tikaputta (q.v.). Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Ves\u00e1li, special mention is made of Ugga (chief of those who gave pleasant gifts), Pingiy\u00e1ni, K\u00e1ranap\u00e1li, S\u00edha, V\u00e1settha (A.iv.258), and the various Licchavis (see Licchavi.)</p><p>The Buddha's presence in Ves\u00e1li was a source of discomfort to the Niganthas, and we find mention (See, e.g., S\u00edha) of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha.</p><p>At the time of the Buddha, Ves\u00e1li was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. There were seven thousand seven hundred and seven pleasure grounds and an equal number of lotus ponds. Its courtesan, Ambap\u00e1l\u00ed, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous (Vin.i.268). The city had three walls, each one g\u00e1vuta away from the other, and at three places in the walls were gates with watch towers. </p><p>J.i.604; cf.i.389. Perhaps these three walls separated the three districts of Vais\u00e1l\u00ed mentioned in the Tibetan Dulva (Rockhill, p.62); Hoernle (Uv\u00e1sagadas\u00e1o Translation ii., p.4, n.8) identifies these three districts with the city proper, Kundapura and V\u00e1niyag\u00e1ma, respectively mentioned in the Jaina books. Buddhaghosa says (e.g., Sp.ii.393) that Ves\u00e1li was so called", "because it was extensive (vis\u00e1l\u00edbh\u00fatat\u00e1 Ves\u00e1li ti uccati); cf.

The messengers, sent by Mig\u00e1ra of S\u00e1vatthi to find a suitable bride for his son Pa\u00f1\u00f1avaddhana, saw Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 on her way to the lake to bathe on a feast day. At that moment there was a great shower. Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1's companions ran for shelter, but Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 herself, walking at her usual pace, came to the place where the messengers, already greatly impressed, were awaiting her. When they asked her why she did not run to seek shelter and so preserve her clothes, she answered that she had plenty of clothes in the house, but that if she ran she might damage a limb which would be a great loss. \"Unmarried girls,\" she said, \"are like goods awaiting sale, they must not be disfigured.\" The messengers offered her a bouquet of flowers (m\u00e1l\u00e1gulam), which she accepted as a proposal of marriage, and then went on to her father's house. The messengers followed and laid Punnavaddhana's suit before Dhana\u00f1jaya. The proposal was accepted and confirmed by an exchange of letters.</p><p>When Pasenadi heard of it, he offered to accompany Punnavaddhana to S\u00e1keta, as a mark of signal favour. Dhana\u00f1jaya welcomed the king and his retinue, Mig\u00e1ra, Punnavaddhana and their followers, with all honour, attending personally to all the details of hospitality. He persuaded the king to stay with him during the rains, providing all that was necessary. According to the DhA. account (loc. cit.) Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 superintended all the arrangements.</p><p>Five hundred goldsmiths were engaged to make the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahalata_pasadhana')\">Mah\u00e1lat\u00e1pas\u00e1dhana</a> (ornament), q.v., for the bride; three months passed, but it was still unfinished. The supply of firewood ran out, and orders were given that the wood of dilapidated houses should be used. This wood lasted for a fortnight, and then the storehouses containing cloths were opened, the cloths soaked in oil", "and used for cooking the food. The ornament was finished in four months. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she gave bowls and robes to twenty thousand monks, also thread and needles and sewing materials; as a result of this, she received her parure in this life (DhA.i.395).</p><p>Dhana\u00f1jaya gave his daughter, as dowry, five hundred carts full of money, five hundred with vessels of gold, five hundred each of silver, copper, various silks, ghee, rice husked and winnowed; also ploughs, ploughshares, and other farm implements, five hundred carts with three slave-women in each, everything being provided for them. The cattle given by him filled an enclosure three quarters of a league in length and eight rods across, standing shoulder to shoulder, and in addition to these, sixty thousand bulls and sixty thousand milk cows escaped from their stalls and joined the herd already gifted to her. In her birth as Sanghad\u00e1si, she gave the five products of the cow to twenty thousand monks, begging them to eat; hence the escaping of the cattle for her benefit (DhA.i.397). Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1's relations continued to send her costly gifts even after her marriage. The Ud\u00e1na (ii.9) contains a story of a dispute she had with the customs officers regarding the duty they levied on one of her presents. She visited Pasenadi several times, trying to get the matter settled; but he had no time to give to the matter, and, in the end, she sought consolation from the Buddha.</p><p>When the time came for Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 to leave, Dhana\u00f1jaya gave her ten admonitions, which Mig\u00e1ra overheard from the next room. These admonitions were: Not to give fire from the house outside; not to take into the house fire from without; to give only to those who give in return: not to give to those who do not give in return; to give to him that gives and to him that gives not; to sit, eat and sleep happily; to tend the fire and to honour", "household deities. These riddles were later explained by Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 to her father in law (DhA.i.403f.).</p><p>On the following day Dhana\u00f1jaya appointed eight householders to be sponsors to his daughter and to enquire into any charges which might be brought against her. When she left, Dhana\u00f1jaya allowed any inhabitants of his fourteen tributary villages to accompany her if they so wished. As a result the villages were left empty; but Mig\u00e1ra, fearing that he should have to feed them, drove most of them back. Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 entered S\u00e1vatthi standing in her chariot, so that all might see her glory. The citizens showered gifts on her, but these she distributed among the people.</p><p>Mig\u00e1ra was a follower of the Niganthas, and, soon after Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1's arrival in his house, he sent for them and told her to minister to them. But Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1, repulsed by their nudity, refused to pay them homage. The Niganthas urged that she should be sent away, but Mig\u00e1ra bided his time. One day, as Mig\u00e1ra was eating, while Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 stood fanning him, a monk was seen standing outside his house. Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 stood aside, that Mig\u00e1ra might see him, but as Mig\u00e1ra continued to eat without noticing the monk, she said to the latter, \"Pass on, Sir, my father in law eats stale fare.\" Mig\u00e1ra was angry and threatened to send her away, but, at her request, the matter was referred to her sponsors. They enquired into the several charges brought against her and adjudged her not guilty. Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 then gave orders that preparations should be made for her return to her parents. But Mig\u00e1ra begged her forgiveness which she granted, on condition that he would invite to the house the Buddha and his monks. This he did, but, owing to the influence of the Niganthas, he left Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 to entertain them, and only consented to hear the Buddha's sermon at the end of the meal from behind a curtain. At the conclusion of this sermon,", "however, he became a sot\u00e1panna. His gratitude towards Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 was boundless; henceforth she was to be considered as his mother and to receive all the honour due to a mother; from this time onwards she was called Mig\u00e1ram\u00e1t\u00e1. In DhA.i.406 we are told that in order to confirm this declaration, Mig\u00e1ra sucked the breast of Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1. This account adds that she had also a son named Mig\u00e1ra; thus there was a double reason for the name. AA.i.313 says that Mig\u00e1ra was her eldest son.</p><p>Mig\u00e1ra got made for her everyday use an ornament called ghanamatthaka, at a cost of one hundred thousand. (Some time after, Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 sold the Mat\u00e1lat\u00e1pas\u00e1dhana and built the Mig\u00e1ram\u00e1tup\u00e1sada.) On the day of the presentation of this ornament, Mig\u00e1ra held for her a special festival in her honour, and she was made to bathe in sixteen pots of perfumed water. This account of Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 is summarized from DhA.i.384ff.; AA.i.219ff. contains a similar account but with far less detail. The DhA. account contains numerous other particulars, some of which are given below.</p><p>Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 had ten sons and ten daughters, each of whom had a similar number of children, and so on down to the fourth generation. Before her death, at the age of one hundred and twenty, she had eighty four thousand and twenty direct lineal descendants, all living. (But see Ud.viii.8, which speaks of the death of a grand daughter and of Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1's great grief; this evidently refers to Datt\u00e1). She herself kept, all her life, the appearance of a girl of sixteen. She had the strength of five elephants, and it is said that once she took the trunk of an elephant, which was sent to test her, between her two fingers and forced him back on his haunches (DhA.i.409). Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 owned such a great reputation for bringing good fortune that the people of S\u00e1vatthi always invited her to their houses on festivals and holidays (Ibid.).</p>", "<p>Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 fed five hundred monks daily at her house. (Thus, e.g., J.iv.144; two thousand, according to DhA.i.128; later she appointed her grand daughter, probably Datt\u00e1, to officiate for her.) In the afternoon she visited the Buddha, and, after listening to his sermon, would go round the monastery inquiring into the needs of the monks and nuns (*1). In these rounds she was sometimes accompanied by Suppiy\u00e1 (*2). Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 begged for, and was granted, eight boons by the Buddha: that as long as she lived she be allowed to give robes to the members of the Order for the rainy season; food for monks coming into S\u00e1vatthi (*3); food for those going out; food for the sick; food for those who wait on the sick; medicine for the sick; a constant supply of rice gruel for any needing it; and bathing robes for the nuns (*4).</p><p>With the construction of the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada')\">M\u00edg\u00e1ram\u00e1tup\u00e1s\u00e1da</a> (q.v.) in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pubbarama')\">Pubb\u00e1r\u00e1ma</a> Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1's ambitions were fulfilled, and it is said (DhA.i.416f) that when the monastery was completed and the festival of opening in progress, as the evening drew on she walked round the monastery accompanied by her children, her grandchildren and her great grandchildren, and in five stanzas sang her joy, saying, \"Now is entirely fulfilled the prayer which I prayed in times of yore.\" (The wishes mentioned in these stanzas as having been fulfilled differ from the eight boons mentioned above). The monks heard her sing and told the Buddha; he related to them how, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 had been the friend of the principal women benefactors of that Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was Sanghad\u00e1s\u00ed, youngest of the seven daughters of Kiki, and for long after her marriage she gave alms and performed other good works with her sisters. (AA.i.219).</p>", "<hr><blockquote>  <p>(*1) Because she wished the Sangha well she was   appointed on the committee set up to enquire into the charge of misbehaviour   brought against the mother of Kum\u00e1rakassapa (q.v.); Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1's experience as   the mother of several children stood her in good stead.</p>  <p>(*2) For an incident connected with one of these visits,   see Suppiy\u00e1. DhA. (i. 100f.) says that once five hundred young men of good   family entrusted the care of their wives to Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1. On one occasion, when   accompanying her to the monastery, they became drunk and committed   improprieties in the presence of the Buddha. The Buddha frightened them by   emitting a dark blue ray of light, thus restoring them to their senses. This   was the occasion of the preaching of the Kumbha J\u00e1taka; see also J.v.11f.</p>  <p>(*3) Probably on account of this boon the monks who had   been to see Khadiravaniya Revata (q.v.) visited Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 immediately after   their return to S\u00e1vatthi; but see the P\u00edtha J\u00e1taka.</p>  <p>(*4) This list of boons and Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1\u2019s reasons for   begging them are given at Vin.i.290ff.

But he continued to express this desire, and when he reached the age of sixteen she consented to his going. Thereupon, accompanied by a large retinue, he set out for Kapilavatthu. The S\u00e1kiyans sent all the younger princes away, there being thus none to pay obeisance to him in answer to his salute, the remaining ones being older than he. He was shown every hospitality and stayed for several days. On the day of his departure, one of his retinue overheard a contemptuous remark passed by a slave woman who was washing, with milk and water, the seat on which Vid\u00fadabha had sat. This was reported to him, and, having discovered the deceit which had been practiced on his father, he vowed", "vengeance on the S\u00e1kiyans.

The Buddha, aware of this, stood under a tree, with scanty shade, just within the boundaries of the S\u00e1kiyan kingdom. On the boundary was a banyan which gave deep shade. Vid\u00fadabha, seeing the Buddha, asked him to sit under the banyan. \"Be not worried,\" said the Buddha, \"the shade of my kinsmen keeps me cool.\u201d Vid\u00fadabha understood and returned home with his army.

The fourth time the Buddha knew that the fate of the S\u00e1kiyans could not be averted and remained away. In a previous existence they had conspired and thrown poison into a river.</p><p>The S\u00e1kiyans went armed into the battle, but not wishing to kill, they shot their arrows into Vid\u00fadabha's ranks without killing anyone. On this being brought to Vid\u00fadabha's notice, he gave orders that all the S\u00e1kiyans, with the exception of the followers of the S\u00e1kiyan Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma, should be slain. The S\u00e1kiyans stood their ground, some with blades of grass and some with reeds. These were spared, and came to be known as Tinas\u00e1ky\u00e1 and Nalas\u00e1kiy\u00e1 respectively.*</p><p>The others were all killed, even down to the infants.

The N\u00e1gas of the lake, however, saved him and took him to the N\u00e1ga world. That same night Vid\u00fadabha pitched his camp on the dry bed of the Aciravat\u00ed. Some of his men lay on the banks, others on the river bed. Some of those who lay on the river bed were not guilty of sin in their past lives, while some who slept on the bank were. Ants appeared on the ground where the sinless ones lay, and they changed their sleeping places.

(In the twelfth year, according to Buddhaghosa   e.g., AA.ii.758; cf. BuA.3). Vera\u00f1ja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Nalerupicumanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tath\u00e1gata were so to honour anyone, that person's head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the Buddha\u2019s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the conversion of Vera\u00f1ja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there. Here he spoke of the Vijj\u00e1ttaya, says UdA.(p. 183), because all the monks with the Buddha were chalabhi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1, and therefore no special mention was needed of abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1.</p><p>At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttar\u00e1patha, staying at Vera\u00f1j\u00e1, supplied the monks with food. Moggall\u00e1na proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this stay S\u00e1riputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them -  Vipass\u00ed, Sikh\u00ed and Vesabh\u00fa-  did not.</p><p>At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Vera\u00f1ja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality. Vera\u00f1ja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in", "the house. The Commentators add that Vera\u00f1ja forgot his invitation because M\u00e1ra, being in a spiteful mood, had taken possession of him and of all the inhabitants of Vera\u00f1ja (Sp.i.178 L; DhA.ii.153; cf.

The interview with Vera\u00f1ja is given at A.iv.172ff. The road taken by the Buddha from Vera\u00f1j\u00e1 to Benares was, according to Buddhaghosa (Sp.i.201), the shortest, and the Buddha knew the monks were tired after their experiences in Vera\u00f1j\u00e1. Soon after, he appears to have visited Kapilavatthu. There he was visited by Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma, the S\u00e1kyan, who asked permission to entertain him and the monks for four months that they might recover their strength. At the end of the four months he renewed his request, and thus looked after the monks for a whole year.

Forty years later Arindama wished to see Sonaka, but no one could tell him his whereabouts in spite of the offer of a large reward. Ten years later Sonaka saw the king through the good offices of a lad of seven, who belonged to the harem and had learnt a song composed by the king expressing his desire to meet Sonaka.

No one was found willing to take the risk till they came to Potali in the Assaka country.

The light of the sun and of the moon never falls directly on the, water but only in reflection. This means that the water is always cool, hence the name.  </p><p> </p><p>Many bathing places are found therein free from fish and tortoises, with crystal clear waters, where Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas and arahants bathe, and whither devas and yakkhas come for sport. Four channels open out of the lake in the direction of the four quarters: S\u00edhamukha, Hatthimukha, Assamukha and Usabhamukha. Lions abound on the banks of the S\u00edhamukha; elephants, horses and cattle respectively on the others. Four rivers flow from these channels; the eastward river encircles the lake three times, waters the non-human regions of Himav\u00e1 and enters the ocean. The rivers that flow north and westward flow in those directions through regions inhabited by non-humans and also enter the ocean. The southward river, like the eastward, flows three times round the lake and then straight south over a rocky channel for sixty leagues and then down a precipice, forming a cascade six miles in width. For sixty leagues the water dashes through the air on to a rock named", "Tiyaggala, whereon by the force of the impact of the waters the Tiyaggalapokkharani has been formed, fifty leagues deep. From this lake the waters run through a rocky chasm for sixty leagues, then underground for sixty leagues to an oblique mountain, Vijjha, where the stream divides into five, like the fingers of the hand. The part of this river which encircles the original lake Anotatta is called \u00c1vattagang\u00e1; the sixty leagues of stream which run over the rocky channel, Kanhagang\u00e1; the sixty leagues of waterfall in the air, \u00c1k\u00e1sagang\u00e1; the sixty leagues flowing out of the Tiyaggala-pokkharan\u00ed and through the rocky gorge is called Bahalagang\u00e1, and the river underground, Ummaggagang\u00e1. The five streams into which the river is divided after leaving the oblique mountain Vijjha are called Gang\u00e1, Yamun\u00e1, Aciravat\u00ed, Sarabh\u00fa and Mah\u00ed (SnA.ii.407; 437-9; MA.ii.585f.; AA.ii.759-60).</p><p> </p><p>A wind called Si\u00f1canakav\u00e1ta (sprinkling wind) takes water from the Anotatta lake and sprinkles the Gandham\u00e1dana mountain with it (SnA.i.66). The lake is one of the last to dry up at the end of the world (A.iv.101). To be bathed in the waters of the lake is to be thoroughly cleansed. Thus the Buddha's mother, on the day of her conception, dreamt that she had been taken to the lake and had bathed there. This was interpreted to mean that she would give birth to a holy son (MA.ii.918).</p><p>During periods when the world does not possess a Buddha, the Pacceka Buddhas, who dwell in Gandham\u00e1dana, come amongst men and wash their faces in the lake before starting on their aerial journey for Isipatana (MA.i.386) or elsewhere (E.g., J.iii.319, iv.368). The Buddha would often go to Anotatta for his ablutions and proceed from there to Uttarakuru for alms, returning to the lake to have his meal and spend the hot part of the day on its banks. E.g., before his visit to Uruvelakassapa (Vin.i.28); and again", "during the three months he spent in T\u00e1vatimsa (DhA.iii.222); see also J.i.80.</p><p>Examples are given of other holy men doing the same.

Other instances are given of goddesses bathing in the lake and resting on the banks of the Manosil\u00e1tala next to it (E.g., J.v.392).</p><p> </p><p>It was considered the summit of iddhi-power to be able to obtain water from Anotatta.

And Sona, to show his iddhi to the 101 kings who escorted his brother Nanda to his hermitage, brought water from Anotatta for them and for their retinue (J.v.320-1). To provide water from the lake for the personal use of some eminent person is considered one of the best ways of showing him esteem.

This water had curative powers; Anuruddha's abdominal affliction was cured by its use (DhA.iv.129). To be able to use water from Anotatta daily was a great luxury and a sign of real prosperity. Gods brought to Asoka eight pingo-loads of lake water in sixteen pots for his use (Sp.i.42; Mhv.v.24; 84; xi.30). Vessavana employed yakkhinis to fetch water for him in turn, each turn lasting for four to five months. It was exhausting work and some of them died before their term of service was over (DhA.i.40).</p><p> </p><p>Regular assemblies of the devas and yakkhas were held on the banks of Anotatta, at which contests of skill took place (E.g, among the daughters of Vessavana, demonstrating their ability to dance, VvA.131-2).

He came to be called by his family name Konda\u00f1\u00f1a. He was learned in the three Vedas, excelling in the science of physiognomy. </p><p>When the Buddha was born he was among the eight brahmins (the others being R\u00e1ma, Dhaja, Lakkhana, Mant\u00ed, Bhoja, Suy\u00e1ma and Sudatta. In the Milinda (236), where the eight names are given, Konda\u00f1\u00f1a appears as Ya\u00f1\u00f1a) sent for to prognosticate, and though he was yet quite a novice he declared definitely that the babe would be a Buddha. Thereafter he lived awaiting the Bodhisatta's renunciation. After this happened he left the world with four others, and the five later became known as the Pa\u00f1cavaggiy\u00e1 (J.i.65f.; AA.i.78-84; ThagA.ii.1ff). When, after the Enlightenment, the Buddha visited them at Isipatana and preached the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, Konda\u00f1\u00f1a and eighteen crores of brahmas won the Fruit of the First Path. As he was the first among humans to realise the Dhamma the Buddha praised him saying \"a\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1si vata bho Konda\u00f1\u00f1o\" twice; hence he came to be known as A\u00f1\u00f1ata Konda\u00f1\u00f1a.

Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests that A\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1 was his personal name (Gotama the Man, p.102).</p><p>Five days later when the Anattalakhana Sutta was preached he became arahant (Vin.i.13-14). He was the first to be ordained with the formula \"ehi, bhikkhu\" and the first to receive higher ordination. Later, at Jetavana, amidst a large concourse of monks, the Buddha", "declared him to be the best of those who first comprehended the Dhamma (AA.i.84). He was also declared to be pre-eminent among disciples of long-standing (ratta\u00f1\u00f1\u00fanam) (A.i.23). </p><p>In the assembly of monks he sat behind the two chief disciples. Finding that his presence near the Buddha was becoming inconvenient to himself and others (For his reasons see AA.i.84; SA.i.216), he obtained the Buddha's permission to go and live on the banks of the Mand\u00e1kini in the Chaddanta-vana, where he stayed for twelve years, only returning at the end of that period to obtain the Buddha's leave for his parinibb\u00e1na. The elephants in the forest took it in turns to bring him his food and to look after him. Having bidden farewell to the Buddha, he returned to Chaddanta-vana, where he passed away (SA.i.218; AA.i.84). We are told (SA.i.219) that all Himav\u00e1 wept at his death. The obsequies were elaborately performed by eight thousand elephants with the deva N\u00e1gadatta at their head. All the devas from the lowest to the highest brahma world took part in the ceremony, each deva contributing a piece of sandalwood. Five hundred monks, led by Anuruddha, were present. The relics were taken to Veluvana and handed over to the Buddha, who with his own hand deposited them in a silver cetiya which appeared from the earth. Buddhaghosa states that the cetiya existed even in his time (SA.i.219).</p><p>Several verses attributed to Konda\u00f1\u00f1a are given in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1, admonishing fellow celibates to lead the higher life, because everything is impermanent, bound to ill and void of soul (Thag.674-88).</p><p>On one occasion he preached to Sakka at the latter's own request; Sakka expressed himself as greatly pleased because the sermon was worthy even of the Buddha.\"</p><p>Vangisa once extolled his virtues in the presence of the Buddha (Thag.v.673; ThagA.ii.3).</p>", "<p>In Padumuttara's time Konda\u00f1\u00f1a had been a rich householder, and, seeing one of the monks given preference in seniority, he wished for a similar rank for himself in the future.

Henceforward Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na seems to have spent a good deal of his time in Avanti, dwelling in the city of Kuraraghara in the Pap\u00e1ta Pabbata (S.iii.9, 12; iv.115-16; A.v.46; also UdA.307).</p><p>The religion thus introduced, however, does not seem to have spread to any extent until much later; for we find Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na experiencing great difficulty in collecting ten monks, in order that Sona Kutikanna might receive the higher Ordination; in fact it was not until three years had elapsed that he succeeded (Vin.i.195). Later, when Sona Kutikanna visited the Buddha at S\u00e1vatthi, he conveyed to the Buddha Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na's request that special rules might be laid down for the convenience of the monks of Avanti Dakkhin\u00e1patha and of, other border countries (Vin.i.197-8).", "The Buddha agreed, and among the rules so laid down were the following:  </p><ul>  <li>(1) The higher Ordination could be given with only four monks and a Vinayadhara. </li>  <li>(2) Monks are allowed the use of shoes with thick linings (because in Avanti the soil is black on the surface, rough and trampled by cattle). </li>  <li>(3) Monks are enjoined to bathe frequently (the men of Avanti attaching great importance to bathing). </li>  <li>(4) Sheepskins, goatskins, etc., could be used as coverlets. </li>  <li>(5) Robes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district, and the ten days' rule with regard to such a gift will not begin until the robes have actually reached the monk's hands (Cp. the first nissaggiya rule, Vin.iii.195-6) (this, evidently, because of difficulty of access).</li></ul><p>By the time of the Ves\u00e1li Council, however, Avanti had become one of the important centres of the orthodox school, for we find <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa')\">Yasa K\u00e1kandakaputta</a> sending messengers to Avanti to call representatives to the Council, and we are told that eighty-eight arahants obeyed the summons (Vin.ii.298-9).</p><p>Among other localities in Avanti (besides those mentioned above) were Ghanaselapabbata, Makkarakata and Velug\u00e1ma, and, in Jaina works, we find mention also of Sudarsanapura (Law: Ksatriya Tribes, p.148).</p><p>Even in the Buddha's day there were rumours of the King of Avanti making preparations to attack Magadha, but we are not told that he ever did so (E.g.,M.iii.7).

He was so excited by the thought of the visit that he got up three times during the night. When, at last, he started for S\u00edtavana, the road was quite dark, but a friendly Yakkha, S\u00edvaka, sped him on with words of encouragement.

An\u00e1thapindika was immediately converted and became a Sot\u00e1panna. He invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, providing everything himself, although the setthi, the Mayor of R\u00e1jagaha and King Bimbis\u00e1ra asked to be allowed to help. After the meal, which he served to the Buddha with his own hand, he invited the Buddha to spend the rainy season at S\u00e1vatthi, and the Buddha accepted, saying \"the Tath\u00e1gatas, o householder, take pleasure in solitude.\" \"I understand, o Blessed One, I understand,\" was the reply.</p>", "<p> </p><p>When An\u00e1thapindika had finished his business at R\u00e1jagaha he set out towards S\u00e1vatthi, giving orders along the way to his friends and acquaintances to prepare dwellings, parks, rest-houses and gifts all along the road to S\u00e1vatthi in preparation for the Buddha's visit. He had many friends and acquaintances and he was \u00e1deyyavaco (his word was held to be of weight), loc. cit., p.158.

He bought the park at great expense and erected therein the famous Jetavan\u00e1r\u00e1ma. As a result of this and of his numerous other benefactions in the cause of the S\u00e1sana, An\u00e1thapindika came to be recognised as the chief of alms-givers (A.i.25).</p><p> </p><p>An\u00e1thapindika's personal name was Sudatta, but he was always called An\u00e1thapindika (AA.i.208; MA.i.50) (feeder of the destitute) because of his munificence; he was, however, very pleased when the Buddha addressed him by his own name (Vin.ii.156). He spent eighteen crores on the purchase of Jetavana and a like sum on the construction of the vih\u00e1ra; another eighteen crores were spent in the festival of dedication. He fed one hundred monks in his house daily in addition to meals provided for guests, people of the village, invalids, etc. Five hundred seats were always ready in his house for any guests who might come (AA.i.208-9.

The daughters, on the other hand, were most dutiful and helped their father in ministering to the monks. The two elder ones attained to the First Fruit of the Path, married, and went to live with the families of their husbands. Suman\u00e1 obtained the Second Fruit of the Path, but remained unmarried. Overwhelmed with disappointment because of her failure in finding a husband, she refused to eat and died; she was reborn in Tusita (DhA.i.128f).</p><p> </p><p>The Bhadraghata J\u00e1taka (J.ii.431) tells us of a nephew of An\u00e1thapindika who squandered his inheritance of forty crores. His uncle gave him first one thousand and then another five hundred with which to trade. This also he squandered. An\u00e1thapindika then gave him two garments.

A little later he was found dead by a side wall.</p><p> </p><p>The books also mention a girl, Punn\u00e1,", "who was a slave in An\u00e1thapindika's household. On one occasion when the Buddha was starting on one of his periodical tours from Jetavana, the king, An\u00e1thapindika, and other eminent patrons failed to stop him; Punn\u00e1, however, succeeded, and in recognition of this service An\u00e1thapindika adopted her as his daughter (MA.i.347-8). On uposatha days his whole household kept the fast; on all occasions they kept the pa\u00f1cas\u00edla inviolate (J.iii.257).</p><p> </p><p>A story is told of one of his labourers who had forgotten the day and gone to work; but remembering later, he insisted on keeping the fast and died of starvation. He was reborn as a deva (MA.i.540-1).</p><p> </p><p>An\u00e1thapindika had a business village in K\u00e1si and the superintendent of the village had orders to feed any monks who came there (Vin.iv.162f). One of his servants bore the inauspicious name of K\u00e1lakanni (curse); he and the banker had been playmates as children, and K\u00e1lakanni, having fallen on evil days, entered the banker's service. The latter's friends protested against his having a man with so unfortunate a name in his household, but he refused to listen to them. One day when An\u00e1thapindika was away from home on business, burglars came to rob his house, but K\u00e1lakanni with great presence of mind drove them away (J.i.364f).</p><p>A similar story is related of another friend of his who was also in his service (J.i.441).</p><p> </p><p>All his servants, however, were not so intelligent. A slave woman of his, seeing that a fly had settled on her mother, hit her with a pestle in order to drive it away, and killed her (J.i.248f).</p><p> </p><p>A slave girl of his borrowed an ornament from his wife and went with her companions to the pleasure garden. There she became friendly with a man who evidently desired to rob her of her ornaments. On", "discovering his intentions, she pushed him into a well and killed him with a stone (J.iii.435).</p><p> </p><p>The story of An\u00e1thapindika's cowherd, Nanda, is given elsewhere.</p><p> </p><p>All the banker's friends were not virtuous; one of them kept a tavern (J.i.251). As a result of An\u00e1thapindika's selfless generosity he was gradually reduced to poverty. But he continued his gifts even when he had only bird-seed and sour gruel. The devata who dwelt over his gate appeared before him one night and warned him of his approaching penury; it is said that every time the Buddha or his monks came to the house she had to leave her abode over the gate and that this was inconvenient to her and caused her to be jealous. An\u00e1thapindika paid no attention to her warnings and asked her to leave the house. She left with her children, but could find no other lodging and sought counsel from various gods, including Sakka. Sakka advised her to recover for An\u00e1thapindika the eighteen crores that debtors owed him, another eighteen that lay in the bottom of the sea, and yet eighteen more lying unclaimed. She did so and was readmitted (DhA.iii.10ff; J.i.227ff).</p><p> </p><p>An\u00e1thapindika went regularly to see the Buddha twice a day, sometimes with many friends (J.i.95ff.; he went three times says J.i.226), and always taking with him alms for the young novices. But we are told that he never asked a question of the Buddha lest he should weary him. He did not wish the Buddha to feel obliged to preach to him in return for his munificence (DhA.i.3). But the Buddha of his own accord preached to him on various occasions; several such sermons are mentioned in the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya:</p><ul>  <li>  <p>on the importance of having a   well-guarded mind like a well-protected gable in a house (A.i.261f);", "</li>  <li>  <p>on the benefits the recipient of food   obtains (life, beauty, happiness, strength); </li>  <li>  <p>on the four obligations that make up   the pious householder's path of duty (gihis\u00e1mikicc\u00e1ni - waiting on the Order   with robes, food, lodgings, medical requirements. Referred to also in S.v.387,   where An\u00e1thapindika expresses his satisfaction that he had never failed in   these obligations); </li>  <li>  <p>on the four conditions of success that   are hard to win (wealth gotten by lawful means, good report, longevity, happy   rebirth); </li>  <li>  <p>on the four kinds of happiness which a   householder should seek (ownership, wealth, debtless ness, blamelessness)   (these various tetrads are given in A.ii.64ff).</li>  <li>  <p>on the five kinds of enjoyment which   result from wealth rightfully obtained (enjoyment - experienced by oneself and   by one's friends and relations, security in times of need, ability to pay   taxes and to spend on one's religion, the giving of alms to bring about a   happy rebirth, A.iii.45-6); </li>  <li>  <p>the five things which are very   desirable but difficult to obtain (long life, beauty, happiness, glory, good   condition of rebirths, A.iii.47-8); </li>  <li>  <p>the five sinful acts that justify a   man's being called wicked (hurting of life, etc. A.iii.204); </li>  <li>  <p>the inadvisability of being satisfied   with providing requisites for monks without asking oneself if one also   experiences the joy that is born of ease of mind (evidently a gentle warning   to An\u00e1thapindika, A.iii.206-7).</li></ul><p>The Buddha preached the Vel\u00e1ma Sutta to encourage An\u00e1thapindika when he had been reduced to poverty and felt disappointed that he could no longer provide luxuries for the monks", "(A.iv.392ff). On another occasion the Buddha tells An\u00e1thapindika that the Sot\u00e1panna is a happy man because he is free from various fears: fear of being born in hell, among beasts, in the realm of Peta or in some other unhappy state; he is assured of reaching Enlightenment (A.iv.405f, also S.v.387f).</p><p> </p><p>Elsewhere the Buddha tells An\u00e1thapindika that it is not every rich man who knows how to indulge in the pleasures of sense legitimately and profitably (A.v.177ff).</p><p> </p><p>There is, however, at least one sutta preached as a result of a question put by An\u00e1thapindika himself regarding gifts and those who are worthy to receive them (A.i.62-3); and we also find him consulting the Buddha regarding the marriage of his daughter, Cola Subhadd\u00e1 (DhA.iii.466).</p><p> </p><p>An\u00e1thapindika died before the Buddha. As he lay grievously ill he sent a special message to S\u00e1riputta asking him to come (again, probably, because he did not want to trouble the Buddha). S\u00e1riputta went with Ananda and preached to him the An\u00e1thapindikov\u00e1da Sutta (M.iii.258f.; see also S.v.380-7, which contain accounts of incidents connected with this visit). His pains left him as he concentrated his mind on the virtuous life he had led and the many acts of piety he had done. Later he fed the Elders with food from his own cooking-pot, but quite soon afterwards he died and was born in the Tusita heaven. That same night he visited the Buddha at Jetavana and uttered a song of praise of Jetavana and of S\u00e1riputta who lived there, admonishing others to follow the Buddha's teaching.

The brahmin discovers that it lay in the comb of a white cock belonging to An\u00e1thapindika; he asks for the cock and it is given to him, but the luck flies away elsewhere, settling first in a pillow, then in a jewel, a club, and, finally, in the head of An\u00e1thapindika's wife. The brahmin's desire is thus frustrated (J.ii.410f).</p><p> </p><p>On two occasions he was waylaid by rogues. Once they tried to make him drink drugged toddy.

Whenever An\u00e1thapindika visited the Buddha, he was in the habit of relating to the Buddha various things which had come under his notice, and the Buddha would relate to him stories from the past containing similar incidents. Among the J\u00e1takas so preached are: Apannaka, Khadirahg\u00e1ra, Rohin\u00ed, V\u00e1run\u00ed, Punnap\u00e1ti, K\u00e1lakanni, Akata\u00f1\u00f1\u00fa, Ver\u00ed, Kusan\u00e1li, Siri, Bhadraghata, Visayha, Hiri, Sirik\u00e1lakann\u00ed and Sulas\u00e1. </p><p> </p><p>An\u00e1thapindika was not only a shrewd business man but also a keen debater. The Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya (A.v.185-9) records a visit he paid to the Paribb\u00e1jakas when he could think of nothing better to do. A lively debate ensues regarding their views and the views of the Buddha as", "expounded by An\u00e1thapindika. The latter silences his opponents. When the incident is reported to the Buddha, he speaks in high praise of An\u00e1thapindika and expresses his admiration of the way in which he handled the discussion.</p><p> </p><p>During the time of Padumattara Buddha An\u00e1thapindika had been a householder of Hamsavat\u00ed. One day he heard the Buddha speak of a lay-disciple of his as being the chief of alms-givers. The householder resolved to be so designated himself in some future life and did many good deeds to that end. His wish was fulfilled in this present life. An\u00e1thapindika is sometimes referred to as Mah\u00e1 An\u00e1thapindika to distinguish him from C\u00fala An\u00e1thapindika.</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Asurinda (Asurindaka) Sutta</h2>  </li></ul><p>Recounts an interview between the Buddha and Asurinda Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1ja in Veluvana.

MT.293; Mhv.x.76; this tradition seems to have been forgotten later, for in the Mbv.

(A.D. 626-41). After a short period it became once more the capital, and continued to be so until the royal residence was removed elsewhere (see Cv.xlvi.34, where the new capital, Pulatthinagara, is first mentioned as a royal residence). It was finally deserted in the eleventh century.</p><p> </p><p>Panduk\u00e1bhaya beautified the city with the artificial lakes Jayav\u00e1pi and Abhayav\u00e1pi. It was round the last-named lake that the king laid out the city, including four suburbs, a cemetery, special villages for huntsmen and scavengers, temples to various pagan deities and residences for the engineer and other officials. Abodes were also provided for devotees of various sects, such as the Jainas, the Aj\u00edvakas, wandering monks and brahmins. There were also hospitals and lying-in homes. Guardians of the city (Nagaraguttik\u00e1) were appointed, one for the day and another for the night. For a full description see Mhv.x.80-102.</p><p>Panduk\u00e1bhaya's son and successor, Mutasiva, laid out the beautiful Mah\u00e1megha Park with fruit and flowering trees (Mhv.xi.2); this was to the south of the city; between it and the southern wall", "of the city was another park called Nandana or Jotivana (Mhv.xv.2, 11).</p><p> </p><p>In the reign of Piyatissa, who succeeded Mutasiva (when Buddhism had been introduced into the land), the king, together with his nobles and people, erected many noble edifices in support of the new religion. Ten of the most noted were in Anur\u00e1dhapura (for list see Mhv.xx.17ff), and the Mah\u00e1meghavana, which was given over to the Buddhist Sangha, henceforth became the centre of Buddhism in the island. In this park was also planted, by Piyatissa, the branch of the Sacred Bodhi Tree which came from Gay\u00e1 (for details see Mhv.xviii. and xix).</p><p> </p><p>Soon afterwards the city was taken by the Tamils but was recaptured by Dutthag\u00e1mani (101-77 B.C.), the hero of the Mah\u00e1vamsa. Many chapters of the chronicle are devoted to descriptions of the numerous buildings erected by him in Anur\u00e1dhapura for the glorification of the national faith (Mhv. xxvi.-xxxvi), chief among them being the Maricavatti-vih\u00e1ra, the Lohap\u00e1s\u00e1da and the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa.</p><p> </p><p>A few years later the Tamils once more overcame the city and held it till Vattag\u00e1mani (29-17 B.C.) drove them off.

As a result, the district round Anur\u00e1dhapura was overrun by Tamil freebooters and became impossible to defend; the seat of government was therefore removed to Pulatthipura about the beginning of the ninth century, where it continued, except for a brief interval to the eleventh century. Finally, about A.D. 1300, at a date not exactly known, the whole district was abandoned, having become a kind of no-man's land; it then rapidly relapsed into jungle. For quite a long time, however, and even after Pulatthipura became the state capital, Anur\u00e1dhapura was regarded as a centre of religious activity, and its monuments were restored from time to time (Mhv.lxxvi.106-20; lxxviii.96f.; xxxxviii.80f.</p><p> </p><p>Various scraps of information regarding Anur\u00e1dhapura and its inhabitants are found scattered in the commentaries.

The K\u00e1laka\u00f1jakas were of fearsome shape (D.ii.259), and were considered the lowest among the Asuras (D.iii.7; see also K\u00e1la\u00f1kajaka and Vepacitti).</p><p> </p><p>Once the Asuras dwelt in T\u00e1vatimsa together with the devas. When Magha M\u00e1navaka was born as Sakka, he did not relish the idea of sharing a kingdom with others, and having made the Asuras drunken, he had them hurled by their feet on to the steeps of Sineru. There they tumbled into what came to be known as the Asurabhanava, on the lowest level of Sineru, equal in extent to T\u00e1vatimsa. Here grew the Cittap\u00e1tal\u00ed tree, and when it blossomed the Asuras knew they were no longer in the deva-world. </p><p> </p><p>Wishing to regain their kingdom, they climbed Sineru, \"like ants going up a pillar.\" When the alarm was given, Sakka went out to give battle to them in the ocean, but being worsted in the fight, he fled in his Vejayantaratha. Fearing that his chariot hurt the young Garulas, he had it turned back. The Asuras, thinking that Sakka had obtained reinforcements, turned and fled right into the Asurabhavana. Sakka went back to his city and in that moment of victory, the Vejayantap\u00e1s\u00e1da sprang up from the ground. To prevent the Asuras from coming back again, Sakka set up as guard in five places", "N\u00e1gas, Garulas, Kumbhandas, Yakkhas and the Four Great Kings. Everywhere were images of Indra bearing the thunderbolt in his hand. (J.i.202-4; DhA.i.272-80; the same story, differing slightly in details, is found in SnA.484-5). There it is said that when Sakka was born among them, the Asuras received him with great cordiality; see also the various incidents of the Asura war mentioned in the Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya I. 216ff.</p><p> </p><p>The Asuras are sometimes called Pubbadev\u00e1 (SnA.484) and their kingdom is 10,000 leagues in extent. SnA.485; elsewhere, in the same page, it is given as 100,000 leagues.</p><p> </p><p>In Buddhaghosa's time, the bygone lustre of the word Asura (as equivalent to Ahura) seems to have faded. His explanation (SA.i.260) of the name is interesting. When Sakka was born with his followers in the Asura-world (which later became T\u00e1vatimsa) the Asuras prepared a drink called gandap\u00e1na. Sakka warned his companions not to drink it, but the Asuras became drunk and were thrown down Sineru. Halfway down they regained consciousness and made a vow never to drink intoxicants (surd) again; hence their name Asura.</p><p> </p><p>The Anguttara Commentary (ii.526) defines Asura as b\u00edbhaccha, awful, vile. They had a drum called \u00c1lambara (q.v.), made of a crab's claw. They left it behind in their flight from Sakka, and since then Sakka has the use of it (J.ii.344).</p><p> </p><p>A story is told by the Buddha (S.2, v.446) of a man who once saw a whole army with its four divisions enter a lotus stalk and the man thought he was mad. But the Buddha says that it was an Asura army in flight.

It is worth noting that the Buddh\u00e1-pad\u00e1na contains no account of the Buddha's life, either as Gotama or earlier, as Bodhisatta (see, however, Pubbakammapiloti). Nor does the Paccekabuddh\u00e1-pad\u00e1na contain any life-histories.

Cp. the Mah\u00e1pad\u00e1na Sutta (D.ii.1ff), where the word Apad\u00e1na is used as meaning the legend or life-story of a Buddha or a Great One - in this case the seven Buddhas. Or does Mah\u00e1pad\u00e1na mean the Great Story, i.e. the story of the Dhamma and its bearers and promulgation: cp. the title of the Mah\u00e1vastu (Dial.ii.3).</p><p> </p><p>Most of the stories are found in the Paramatthad\u00edpan\u00ed, the Commentary to the Thera- and Ther\u00edg\u00e1th\u00e1, extracted from the Apad\u00e1na with the introductory words, \"tena vuttam Apad\u00e1ne.\" But in numerous instances the names under which the verses appear in the Paramatthad\u00edpan\u00ed differ from those subjoined to the verses in the Apad\u00e1na. In several cases it is a matter of the Commentary giving a name while the Apad\u00e1na gives only a title. E.g., Usabha Thera (ThagA.i.320), called Kosumbaphaliya (Ap.ii.449); and", "Isidinna (ThagA.i.312), called (Ap.ii.415) Sumanav\u00edjaniya. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes the stories are duplicated in the Apad\u00e1na itself, the same story occurring in two places with a very slight alteration in words, even the name of the person spoken of being the same.

Sumana (Sus\u00edma according to the northern legends) the eldest, Asoka, and Tissa (uterine brother of Asoka) the youngest. The Mah\u00e1vamsa T\u00edka (p.125; Mbv.98. In the northern tradition, e.g., Asok\u00e1vad\u00e1nam\u00e1l\u00e1, she is called Subhadr\u00e1ng\u00ed, daughter of a brahmin of Camp\u00e1) gives the name of his mother as Dhamm\u00e1 and calls her Aggamahes\u00ed (Bindus\u00e1ra's chief queen); she belonged to the Moriyavamsa. The preceptor of Dhamm\u00e1's family was an \u00c1j\u00edvaka called Janas\u00e1na (which probably explains Asoka's earlier patronage of the \u00c1j\u00edvakas).</p><p>In his youth Asoka was appointed Governor of Avanti with his capital at Ujjeni. The Divy. says he was in Takkasil\u00e1 with headquarters in Uttar\u00e1patha, where he superseded Sus\u00edma and quelled a rebellion. When Bindus\u00e1ra lay on his death-bed, Asoka left Ujjeni and came to P\u00e1tal\u00edputta where he made himself master of the city and possessor of the throne. He is stated in the Mah\u00e1vamsa (v.20; Mbv.98) to have killed all his brothers except Tissa that he might accomplish his purpose, and to have been", "called Cand\u00e1soka on account of this outrage (Mhv.v.189). It is impossible to say how much truth there is in this account of the accession. Asoka's Rock Edicts seem to indicate that he had numerous brothers, sisters and relations alive at the time they were written in P\u00e1taliputta and other towns (see Mookherji, Asoka, pp. 3-6). His brother Tissa he appointed as his upar\u00e1ja (Mhv.v.33), but Tissa (q.v.) became a religious devotee attaining arahantship. The Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 Commentary refers to another younger brother of Asoka, Vitasoka, who also became an arahant (i.295f. The northern works give quite a different account of his brothers. See Mookherji, p.6).</p><p>Asoka had several wives. His first wife was the daughter of a merchant of Vedisagiri, whom he met when stopping at the merchant's house on his way to Ujjeni (Mhv.xiii.8ff). Her name was Dev\u00ed, also called Vedisa-Mah\u00e1dev\u00ed, and she was a S\u00e1kyan, descended from a S\u00e1kyan family who migrated to Vedisa to escape from Vid\u00fadabha (Mbv., pp.98, 116). Of Dev\u00ed were born a son Mahinda, and a daughter Sanghamitt\u00e1, who became the wife of Aggibrahm\u00e1 and mother of Sumana. Dev\u00ed evidently did not follow Asoka to P\u00e1taliputta, for his aggamahes\u00ed there was Asandhamitt\u00e1 (Mhv.v.85). Asandhamitt\u00e1 died in the thirtieth year of Asoka's reign, and four years later he raised Tissarakkh\u00e1 to the rank of queen. Mhv.xx.1-3. The Allahabad Pillar Inscription mentions another queen, K\u00e1ruv\u00e1k\u00ed, mother of Tivara. The Divy. (chap. xxvii.) gives another, Padm\u00e1vat\u00ed, Kun\u00e1la's mother. Besides the children mentioned above, names of others are given: Jalauka, C\u00e1rumat\u00ed (Mookherji. p.9).</p><p>According to Mah\u00e1vamsa (v.21, 22), Asoka's accession was 218 years after the Buddha's death and his coronation was four years later. The chronicles (v.22ff) contain various stories of his miraculous powers. His command spread a yojana into the air and a yojana under", "the earth. The devas supplied him daily with water from the Anotatta Lake and with other luxuries from elsewhere. Yakkhas, N\u00e1gas and even mice and karav\u00edka birds ministered to his comfort, and thoughtful animals came and died outside his kitchen in order to provide him with food.</p><p>At first Asoka maintained the alms instituted by his father, but soon, being disappointed in the recipients, he began looking out for holy men. It was then that he saw from his window, his nephew, the young novice Nigrodha. Owing to their friendship in a past birth (Asoka, Devanampiyatissa and Nigrodha had been brothers, traders in honey, and they gave honey to a Pacceka Buddha. Asandhamitt\u00e1 had been the maiden who showed the honey-shop to the Pacceka Buddha. The story is given in Mhv.v.49ff), Asoka was at once drawn to him and invited him into the palace. Nigrodha preached to him the Appam\u00e1davagga and the king was greatly pleased. He ceased his benefactions to other religious orders and transferred his patronage to Nigrodha and members of the Buddhist Order. His wealth, which, according to the Samantap\u00e1s\u00e1dik\u00e1 (i.52), amounted to 500,000 pieces daily, he now spent in doing acts of piety - giving 100,000 to Nigrodha to be used in any manner he wished, a like sum for the offering of perfumes and flowers at the Buddha's shrines, 100,000 for the preaching of the Dhamma, 100,000 for the provision of comforts for members of the Order, and the remainder for medicines for the sick. To Nigrodha, in addition to other gifts, he sent sets of robes three times each day, placing them on the back of an elephant, adorned by festoons of flowers. Nigrodha gave these robes to other monks (MA.ii.931).</p><p>Having learnt from Moggaliputta-Tissa that there were 84,000 sections of the Dhamma, he built in various towns an equal number of vih\u00e1ras, and in P\u00e1taliputta he erected the Asok\u00e1r\u00e1ma. With the", "aid of the N\u00e1ga king Mah\u00e1k\u00e1la, he created a life-size figure of the Buddha, to which he made great offerings.</p><p>His two children, Mahinda and Sanghamitt\u00e1, aged respectively twenty and eighteen, he ordained under Moggaliputta-Tissa and Dhammap\u00e1l\u00e1, in the sixth year of his reign (MA.v.197, 209). This raised him from a paccad\u00e1yaka to a s\u00e1sanad\u00e1y\u00e1din.</p><p>In order to purge the Order of undesirable monks and heretical doctrines, Moggaliputta-Tissa held the Third Council under the king's patronage. It is said that the pious monks refused to hold the uposatha with those they considered unworthy. The king, desirous of bringing about unity in the Sangha, sent a minister to restore amity, but the minister, misunderstanding his orders, beheaded many holy monks, being at last stopped by the king's brother Tissa, who was then a monk (MA.vs.240ff).</p><p>At the conclusion of the Council, held in the seventeenth year of his reign (Ibid., 280; in the northern texts Moggaliputta-Tissa's name is given as Upagupta. It was for this Council that the Kath\u00e1vatthu was written), Asoka sent forth theras to propagate the Buddha's religion: Majjhantika to Kasm\u00edra and Gandh\u00e1ra, Mah\u00e1deva to Mahisamandala, Rakkhita to Vanav\u00e1sa, Yona Dhammarakkhita to Aparantaka, Mah\u00e1rakkhita to Yona, Majjhima to the Him\u00e1laya country and Sona and Uttara to Suvannabh\u00fami; Mahinda with Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddas\u00e1la he sent to Lank\u00e1 (Ibid., xii.1-8. For particulars of these missions and identification of the places mentioned, see under the different names; this list appears also in the Samantap\u00e1s\u00e1dik\u00e1, where further interesting details are given. For a discussion on them see Mookherji, pp.33ff). In the eighteenth year of his reign he sent to Lank\u00e1, at Devanampiyatissa's request, Sanghamitt\u00e1, with a branch of the great Bodhi Tree at Buddhagay\u00e1 (Mhv.xx.1). A little earlier he had sent by his grandson Sumana,", "some relics of the Buddha and the Buddha's alms-bowl to be deposited in the th\u00fapas of Lank\u00e1 (Mhv.xvii.10f).</p><p>Asoka reigned for thirty-seven years (Mhv.xx.6). In his later life he came to be called Dhamm\u00e1soka on account of his pious deeds (Mhv.v.189). The D\u00edpavamsa gives his name in several places as Piyadass\u00ed. E.g., vi.1, 2, 25. The title Dev\u00e1nampiya used by Asoka in his inscriptions was also used by Tissa, Asoka's contemporary in Ceylon, and by Asoka's grandson Dasaratha (N\u00e1garjun\u00ed Hill Cave Inscription). It was used also by other kings in Ceylon: Vankan\u00e1sika Tissa, Gajab\u00e1hukag\u00e1min\u00ed and Mahallaka-N\u00e1ga (Ep. Zeyl. i.60.f).</p><p>The Chronicles state that Asoka and <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/d/devaanampiyatissa')\">Devanampiya Tissa</a> of Ceylon had been friends - though they had never seen each other - even before Mahinda's mission to Ceylon. Tissa had sent him, as a friendly gesture, various gifts, and Asoka had returned the courtesy. He sent an embassy of his chosen ministers, bearing gifts marvellous in splendour, that Tissa might go through a second coronation ceremony, and the messengers were directed to give this special message to the king: \"I have taken refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha and declared myself a follower of the religion of the S\u00e1kyaputta. Seek then, even thou, oh best of men, converting thy mind with believing heart, refuge in these best of gems.\" (Mhv.xi.18-36)</p><p>The Milindapanha (p.121) mentions an encounter of Asoka with a courtesan of P\u00e1taliputta, Bindumat\u00ed, who, in order to show the king the power of an Act of Truth, made the waters of the Ganges to flow back. According to the Petavatthu Atthakath\u00e1 (244ff) there was a king of Surattha, called Pingala, who used to visit Asoka in order to give him counsel. Perhaps he was an old friend or tutor of the king.</p>", "<p>Asoka is called a d\u00edpacakkavatti as opposed to padesar\u00e1j\u00e1s like Bimbis\u00e1ra and Pasenadi (Sp.ii.309).</p><p>Asoka had three palaces for the three seasons: Mah\u00e1sappika, Morag\u00edva and Mangala (Ras.i.93).</p><hr><p><b>2.

In due course he developed various iddhi powers. Thenceforward he would often spend the day in the deva worlds. Once, while in T\u00e1vatimsa, he saw the whole city decked with splendour and the gods engaged in great rejoicing. On inquiry he learnt that Siddhattha Gotama, destined to become the Buddha, had been born. Immediately he went to Suddhodana's home and asked to see the babe. From the auspicious marks on its body he knew that it would become the Enlightened One and was greatly overjoyed, but realising that he himself would, by then, be born in an Ar\u00fapa world and would not therefore be able to hear the Buddha preach, he wept and was sad. Having reassured the king regarding the babe's future, Asita sought his sister's son, Nalaka, and ordained him that he might be ready to benefit by the Buddha's teaching when the time came. Later Asita was born in the Ar\u00fapa world (Sn., pp.131-36; SnA.ii.483ff.; J.i.54f).</p><p>According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.483), Asita was so-called because of his dark complexion.

In the Mah\u00e1vastu version (ii.30f) he is spoken of as the son of a brahmin of Ujjeni, and he lives in a hermitage in the Vindhy\u00e1 mountains. It is noteworthy that in the J\u00e1taka version he is called, not an isi, but a t\u00e1pasa, an ascetic practising austerities. And there we are told that when the king brought the boy, the future Buddha, and prepared to make him do reverence to the ascetic, the babe's feet turned up and placed themselves on the ascetic's head.

Anuruddha Thera</b></p><p>First cousin of the Buddha and one of his most eminent disciples. He was the son of the S\u00e1kyan Amitodana and brother of Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma. When members of other S\u00e1kyan families had joined the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma was grieved that none had gone forth from his own. He therefore suggested to his brother that one of them should leave household life. Anuruddha was at first reluctant to agree, for he had been reared most delicately and luxuriously, dwelling in a different house for each season, surrounded by dancers and mimes. But on hearing from Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma of the endless round of household cares he agreed to go. He could not, however, get his mother's consent until he persuaded his cousin Bhaddiya to go with him. Together they went with Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta and their barber Up\u00e1li, to the Blessed One at the Anupiya Mango Grove and were ordained. Before the rainy season was over Anuruddha acquired the dibbacakkhu (Vin.ii.180-3; Mtu.iii.177f), and he was later ranked foremost among those who had obtained this attainment (A.i.23).</p><p>He then received from S\u00e1riputta, as topic of meditation, the eight thoughts of a great man. The list is given in A.iv.228ff. Another conversation he had with S\u00e1riputta before becoming an arahant is reported in A.i.281-2. He went into the P\u00e1c\u00ednavamsad\u00e1ya in the Ceti country to practise these. He mastered seven, but could not learn the eighth. The Buddha, being aware of this, visited him and taught it to him. Thereupon Anuruddha developed insight and realised arahantship in the highest grade (A.iv. loc. cit.; AA.108-9; Thag.901).</p><p>Anuruddha appears in the Suttas as an affectionate and loyal comrade-bhikkhu, full of affection to his kinsman, the", "Buddha, who returned his love. In the assembly he stood near the Buddha (Bu.v.60). When the Buddha, disgusted with the quarrels of the Kosamb\u00ed monks, went away to seek more congenial surroundings, it was to P\u00e1c\u00ednavamsad\u00e1ya that he repaired, where were Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila. The Upakkilesa Sutta (M.iii.153f.), on the sweets of concord and freedom from blemish, seems to have been preached specially to Anuruddha on that occasion, for we are told at the end that he was pleased to have heard it, no mention being made of the other two. And again in the Nalakap\u00e1na Sutta (M.i.462ff.), though a large number of distinguished monks are present, it is to Anuruddha that the Buddha directly addresses his questions, and it is Anuruddha who answers on behalf of them all. See also the C\u00fala- and the Mah\u00e1-Gosinga Suttas.</p><p>Anuruddha was present when the Buddha died at Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1, and knew the exact moment of his death; the verse he uttered on that occasion is thoughtful and shows philosophic calm, in contrast, for example, with that of Ananda. D.ii.156-7. On this see Oldenberg, Nachrichten der Wissenschaften zu Goettingen, 1902, pp.168f.; and Przyluski JA. mai-juin, 1918, pp.486ff.</p><p>Anuruddha was foremost in consoling the monks and admonishing them as to their future course of action. It was Anuruddha again that the Mallas of Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1 consulted regarding the Buddha's last obsequies (D.ii.160f). Later, at the First Council, he played a prominent part and was entrusted with the custody of the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya (DA.i.15).</p><p>In one of the verses ascribed to Anuruddha in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 (904; ThagA.ii.72) it is said that for twenty-five years he did not sleep at all, and that for the last thirty years of his life he slept only during the last watch of the night. The same source (Thag.908; also S.i.200) mentions an occasion where a goddess, J\u00e1lin\u00ed (ThagA.ii.73; this story", "is given in detail in SA.i.225-6), who had been his wife in a previous birth, seeing him grown old and grey with meditation, seeks to tempt him with the joys of heaven, but he tells her he has no need of such things, having attained to freedom from rebirth.</p><p>His death took place in Veluvag\u00e1ma in the Vajji country, in the shade of a bamboo thicket. Thag.919. See also Psalms of the Brethren, p.331, n.1. I cannot trace the reference to Hatthig\u00e1ma. He was one hundred and fifteen years old at the time of his death (DA.ii.413).</p><p>In Padumuttara Buddha's time he had been a rich householder. Hearing one of the monks declared best among possessors of the celestial eye, he wished for a similar honour for himself in the future. He did acts of great merit towards that end, including the holding of a great feast of light in front of the Buddha's tomb. In Kassapa Buddha's age he was born in Benares; one day he placed bowls filled with clarified butter all round the Buddha's tomb and lighted them, himself walking round the tomb all night, bearing on his head a lighted bowl.</p><p>Later he was reborn in a poor family in Benares and was named Annabh\u00e1ra (lit. \"food-bearer\"). One day, while working for his master, the banker Sumana, he gave his meal to a Pacceka Buddha, Uparittha. The banker, having heard from the deity of his parasol of Annabh\u00e1ra's pious deed, rewarded him and set him up in trade. The king, being pleased with him, gave him a site for a house, the ground of which, when dug, yielded much buried treasure. On account of this great accretion of wealth he was given the rank of Dhanasetthi (ThagA.ii.65ff.; Thag.910; DhA.iv.120ff).</p><p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (i.113), as a result of his gift to the Pacceka Buddha, Anuruddha never lacked anything he desired - such had been the wish he expressed. A charming story is", "related in this connection. Once when playing at ball with his friends he was beaten and had to pay with sweets. His mother sent him the sweets, but he lost over and over again until no more sweets were to be had. His mother sent word to that effect, but he did not know the meaning of the words \"there isn't.\" When his mother, to make him understand, sent him an empty bowl, the guardian deity of the city filled it with celestial cakes, so that he should not be disappointed. Thereafter, whenever Anuruddha sent for cakes, his mother would send him an empty vessel, which became filled on the way. See also DhA.iv.124ff.</p><p>The Apad\u00e1na (i.35) mentions another incident of his past. Once, in Sumedha Buddha's time, Anuruddha, having seen the Buddha meditating alone at the foot of a tree, set up lights round him and kept them burning for seven days. As a result he reigned for thirty kappas as king of the gods, and was king of men twenty-eight times. He could see a distance of a league both by day and night.</p><p>On various occasions Anuruddha had discussions with the Buddha, and he was consulted by disciples, both monks and laymen, on points of doctrine and practice. In the Anuruddha Sutta (M.iii.144f) he goes with Abhiya Kacc\u00e1na and two others to a meal at the house of Pa\u00f1cakanga, the king's carpenter. At the end of the meal the carpenter asks him the difference between that deliverance of the heart (cetovimutti) that is boundless (appam\u00e1na) and that which is vast (mahaggata). The discussion leads on to an account of the four states of rebirth among the brilliant gods (\u00c1bh\u00e1), and in reply to the questions of Abhiya Kacc\u00e1na, Anuruddha proceeds to explain their nature. At the end of the discourse we find Anuruddha acknowledging that he himself had lived among these gods.</p><p>In the Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya (S.iv.240-5) he", "is mentioned as questioning the Buddha about women, how they come to be born in happy states and how in woeful purgatory. A similar inquiry is mentioned in the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya. Anuruddha had been visited by some Man\u00e1pak\u00e1yik\u00e1 devas, who had played and sung to him and shown their power of changing their complexions at will. He comes to the Buddha and asks how women could be born among these devas (A.iv.262ff).</p><p>We find him (S.v.174-6, also 299f) being asked by Samyutta and Moggall\u00e1na about the sekha and asekha and about super-knowledge (abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1). In dealing with this passage the Commentary (SA.iii.183) states that Anuruddha used to rise early, and that after ablutions he sat in his cell, calling up a thousand kappas of the past and the future. With his clairvoyant eye he knew the thousand fold universe and all its workings.</p><p>The Anuruddha Samyutta (S.v.294) gives an account of a series of questions asked by Moggall\u00e1na on the satipatth\u00e1n\u00e1, their extent, etc. Anuruddha evidently laid great emphasis on the cultivation of the satipatth\u00e1n\u00e1, for we find mention of them occurring over and over again in his discourses. He attributes all his powers to their development, and admonishes his hearers to practise them. S.v.299-306. He himself considered the dibbacakkhu as the highest attainment. Thus in the Mah\u00e1gosinga Sutta (M.i.213) he declares it to be more worthy than knowledge of the doctrine, meditation, forest-life, discourse on the abhidhamma or self-mastery.</p><p>Once he lay grievously ill in the Andhavana in S\u00e1vatthi, but the pain made no impression on his mind, because, he says, his mind was well grounded in the satipatth\u00e1n\u00e1 (S.v.302, but see DhA.iv.129, where he suffered from wind in the stomach). Apart from his teaching of the satipatth\u00e1n\u00e1, he does not seem to have found fame as a teacher. He was of", "a retiring disposition and never interfered in any of the monks' quarrels.</p><p>Mention is often made of Anuruddha's iddhi-powers. Thus, he was one of those who went to the Brahma-world to curb the pride of the Brahma who had thought that no ascetic could reach his world (S.i.145. The others being Moggall\u00e1na, Mah\u00e1kassapa and Mah\u00e1kappina). The mother of the Yakkha Piyankara, while wandering in search of food, heard him at night reciting some verses from the Dhammapada and stood spellbound listening (S.i.209; SA.i.237-8).</p><p>His iddhi, however, does not seem to have enabled him to prevent his fellow-dweller Abhi\u00f1jika from talking too much (S.ii.203-4), nor his other fellow-dweller B\u00e1hiya from attempting to create dissension in the Order (A.ii.239). Among the Vajjians he seems to have been held particularly in esteem, together with Nandiya and Kimbila.

When the Buddha spent a rainy season in T\u00e1vatimsa preaching the Abhidhamma, it was Anuruddha who kept the people on earth informed of his doings. DhA.iii.218f.; SnA. (ii.570), states that the Buddha went to T\u00e1vatimsa at Anuruddha's request.</p><p>In the Sumanas\u00e1manera Vatthu (DhA.iv.120ff ) we are told how Anuruddha, having himself attained salvation, sought for his friend and benefactor of a past birth, Sumana-setthi. Sumana-setthi had been born near the Vindhy\u00e1 forest as C\u00fallasumana, son of Anuruddha's acquaintance Mah\u00e1munda, and Anuruddha ordained him at the age of seven. The lad became arahant in the tonsure-hall.</p><p>According to the Peta Vatthu (Pv., p.27, vv. 58-60), it was by virtue of a spoonful of food given by him to Anuruddha that Indaka entered T\u00e1vatimsa, and the same gift enabled him to surpass in glory Ankura, who had spent all his wealth in practising generosity.</p><p>Anuruddha had a sister, Rohin\u00ed, who suffered from a skin disease and, therefore, remained indoors; she would not see the Elder when he visited her relations. But he insisted on seeing her and persuaded her to sell her ornaments and build a resting hall for the Buddha and", "his monks. She later became a Stream-enterer and was reborn as Sakka's consort (DhA.iii.295f).</p><p>In Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na books Anuruddha's name appears as Aniruddha. In the Lalitavistara he is mentioned as wearing the Bodhisatta's ornaments when the latter renounced the world. He is sometimes spoken of as a son of Dronodana. Thus, e.g., Mtu i.75; iii.117. See Beal, Records of Western World, ii.38 n. for meaning of Anuruddha. According to the Dulva, it was Anuruddha who, finding Ananda still asekha, got him turned out of the First Council until he became an arahant (Rockhill, p.151).</p><hr><p><b>2.

This was the occasion for the preaching of the Cula-Saccaka Sutta (M.i.227ff).

Between it and R\u00e1jagaha is the river Sappin\u00ed, which rises in the Gijjhak\u00fata (Vin.i.109; Vin. Texts i.254, n.2). Once the Buddha went from Benares to Andhakavinda with 1,250 monks, and many people followed them carrying cartloads of provisions that they might feed them in turn. There were so many awaiting their turn that a certain brahmin (referred to as Andhakavindabr\u00e1hmana) had to wait two months for his to come round. At the end of two months, finding that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency he could possibly supply. Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he approached Ananda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha's permission, the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the monks. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke of the tenfold good qualities of milk-rice. Vin.i.220f.; it was this praise uttered by the Buddha that made Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1 ask him, as a favour, that she should be allowed to supply milk-rice to the monks throughout her life (ibid., 293); see also UdA.112.</p><p>During the same visit of the Buddha, a newly converted minister of the district prepared meat dishes for the fraternity, but being disappointed that the monks, who had had a meal of solid milk-rice earlier, could not eat large quantities of his dishes, he was rather rude to them. Later he expressed remorse, and the Buddha assured him that heaven would be his inheritance (Vin.i.222f. This was the occasion for the rule that monks who have been invited to a meal in one place should not accept milk-rice somewhere else earlier in the same day.).

Here, too, the Buddha mentioned to Ananda the necessity of admonishing and encouraging new members of the Order with regard to five things: good conduct, control of the faculties of sense, abstinence from too much talking, love of solitude and the cultivation of right views (A.iii.138-9; referred to in Sp.iv.789). Once in Andhakavinda the Buddha suffered from disease of the wind. Ananda was asked to obtain gruel for the complaint. The wife of the village physician supplied the gruel with great devotion, and as a result was born in T\u00e1vatimsa, where her abode was known as the Ka\u00f1jik\u00e1d\u00e1yika vim\u00e1na (VvA.185-6).

He was born on the day on which his father left the household life (J.i.60; AA.i.82, etc.; cf. J.i.62). When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu for the first time after his Enlightenment and accepted Suddhodana's invitation, R\u00e1hula's mother (R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1) sent the boy to the Buddha to ask for his inheritance (d\u00e1yajja). The Buddha gave him no answer, and, at the conclusion of the meal, left the palace. R\u00e1hula followed him, reiterating his request until at last the Buddha asked S\u00e1riputta to ordain him. (According to SNA.i.340, Moggall\u00e1na taught him the kammav\u00e1c\u00e1; see also J.ii.393). When Suddhodana heard of this he protested to the Buddha, and asked as a boon that, in future, no child should be ordained without the consent of his parents, and to this the Buddha agreed (Vin.i.82f.; the story of R\u00e1hula's conversion is also given at DhA.i.98f).</p><p>It is said (AA.i.145) that immediately after R\u00e1hula's ordination the Buddha preached to him constantly (abhinhov\u00e1davasena) many suttas for his guidance. R\u00e1hula himself was eager to receive instruction from the Buddha and his teachers and would rise early in the morning and take a handful of sand, saying: \"May I have today as many words of counsel from my teachers as there are here grains of sand!\" The monks constantly spoke of R\u00e1hula's amenability, and one day the Buddha, aware of the subject of their talk, went amongst them and related the Tipallatthamiga J\u00e1taka (J.i.160ff ) and the Tittira J\u00e1taka (J.iii.64ff ) to show them that in past births, too, R\u00e1hula had been known for his obedience. When R\u00e1hula was seven years old, the Buddha preached to him the Ambalatthika R\u00e1hulov\u00e1da Sutta (q.v.) as a warning that he should never lie, even in fun.", "R\u00e1hula used to accompany the Buddha on his begging rounds. Sometimes he would accompany S\u00e1riputta on his begging rounds. He was present when S\u00e1riputta went to his (S\u00e1riputta's) mother's house, where he was roundly abused by her for having left her. DhA.iv.164f). </p><p>R\u00e1hula noticed that he harboured carnal thoughts fascinated by his own physical beauty and that of his father, the Buddha preached to him, at the age of eighteen, the Mah\u00e1 R\u00e1hulov\u00e1da Sutta (q.v.). Two other suttas, also called R\u00e1hulov\u00e1da, one included in the Samyutta and the other in the Anguttara (see below), formed the topics for R\u00e1hula's meditation (Vipassan\u00e1). To these Suttas Buddhaghosa (MA.i.635) adds the S\u00e1manera, or Kum\u00e1rapa\u00f1h\u00e1, and proceeds to enumerate the different purposes which the Buddha had in view in preaching these suttas; see also AA.ii.547. SNA.i.340 says, about the R\u00e1hula Sutta (q.v.), that the Buddha constantly preached it to R\u00e1hula. See also the R\u00e1hula Samyutta.</p><p>Later, the Buddha, knowing that R\u00e1hula's mind was ripe for final attainment, went with him alone to Andhavana, and preached to him the C\u00fala R\u00e1hulov\u00e1da Sutta. At the end of the discourse, R\u00e1hula became an arahant, together with one hundred thousand crores of listening devas. SA.iii.26 says these devas were among those who, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, had heard R\u00e1hula's wish to be born as the son of a future Buddha. They were subsequently born in various deva worlds, but on this day they all assembled at Andhavana in order to be present at the fulfilment of R\u00e1hula\u2019s wish. This scene was one of the incidents sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa, as was also the ordination of R\u00e1hula. Mhv.xxxi.81, 83.</p><p>Afterwards, in the assembly of monks, the Buddha declared R\u00e1hula foremost among those of his disciples who were anxious for training (sikkh\u00e1k\u00e1m\u00e1nam).", "A.i.24; the Vinaya (iii.16) gives a story illustrating R\u00e1hula's extreme conscientiousness in the observance of rules. He arrived one evening at Kosamb\u00ed, when the Buddha was staying there in the Badarik\u00e1r\u00e1ma. R\u00e1hula was told there of a new rule which had been laid down to the effect that no novice should sleep under the same roof as a fully ordained monk. Unable to find any resting place which did not violate this rule, R\u00e1hula spent the night in the Buddha's jakes. When the Buddha discovered him there the next morning, he modified the rule. This incident and R\u00e1hula's keenness in observing rules are described again in greater detail at J.i.161f. There the Buddha is said to have found fault with S\u00e1riputta for his neglect of R\u00e1hula (see also Sp.iv.744). On another occasion, finding no place in which to sleep because monks who had arrived late had taken his sleeping place, R\u00e1hula spent the night in the open, in front of the Buddha's cell. M\u00e1ra, seeing him there, assumed the form of a huge elephant and trumpeted loudly, hoping to frighten him. But the plot failed. This was eight years after R\u00e1hula had attained arahantship (DhA.iv.69f.).</p><p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, both R\u00e1hula and Ratthap\u00e1la were rich householders of Hamsavat\u00ed, who, realizing the vanity of riches, gave all away to the poor. One day they entertained two ascetics of great power. The ascetic to whom R\u00e1hula ministered was in the habit of visiting the abode of the N\u00e1ga king, Pathavindhara, and had been impressed by its magnificence. Therefore, in returning thanks to R\u00e1hula for his hospitality, he wished that his host might resemble Pathavindhara. R\u00e1hula remembered this, and after death he was born in the N\u00e1ga world as Pathavindhara, his friend being born as Sakka. He was, however, dissatisfied with his lot, and one day when, with Vir\u00fapakkha, he was on a visit to Sakka, Sakka recognized him, and finding out that he was", "dissatisfied, suggested to him a remedy. Pathavindhara invited the Buddha to his abode. The Buddha, attended by Sumana and one hundred thousand arahants, came and was entertained by him. In the company of monks was Uparevata, the Buddha's son, seated next to him, and Pathavindhara was so fascinated by him that he could not take his eyes off him. Discovering who he was, Pathavindhara expressed a wish that he, too, might be born as the son of a future Buddha. Later, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, R\u00e1hula was born as Pathavindhara, the eldest son of King Kiki, later becoming his viceroy. His seven sisters built seven residences for the Buddha, and, at their suggestion, Pathavindhara built five hundred residences for the monks. The story of the past as given here is taken from AA.i.141ff.; part of it is given in MA.ii.722 under Ratthap\u00e1la, but the account differs in details. There the N\u00e1ga world is called Bhumindhara, and the N\u00e1ga king, P\u00e1lita. SNA.i.341 differs again and calls the king Sankha. See also ThagA.ii.30 on Ratthap\u00e1la, where no mention is made of R\u00e1hula. The Apad\u00e1na (i. 60f.) gives a different version altogether. There R\u00e1hula gave Padumuttara Buddha a carpet (santhara), as a result of which, twenty one kappas ago, he was born as a khattiya named Vimala, in Renuvat\u00ed. There he lived in a palace, Sudassana, specially built for him by Vissakamma.</p><p>Four verses uttered by R\u00e1hula are included in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 (vs.295 98; Mil.413 contains several other stanzas attributed to R\u00e1hula).</p><p>It is said that the news of R\u00e1hula\u2019s birth was brought to the Bodhisatta when he was enjoying himself in his pleasances on the banks of the royal pond after being decked by Vissakamma. As soon as the news was announced, he made up his mind to renounce the world without delay, for he saw, in the birth of a son, a new bond attaching him to household life (\"R\u00e1hulaj\u00e1to, bandhanam j\u00e1tam\"", "the word r\u00e1hula meaning bond). J.i.60; DhA.i.70. The Ap. Commentary, however, derives R\u00e1hula from R\u00e1hu; just as R\u00e1hu obstructs the moon, so would the child be as obstruction to the Bodhisatta's Renunciation.</p><p>According to the D\u00edgha and Samyutta Commentaries (DA.ii.549; SA.iii.172), R\u00e1hula predeceased the Buddha and even S\u00e1riputta, and the place of his death is given as T\u00e1vatimsa. For twelve years he never lay on a bed. (DA.iii.736).</p><p>In numerous J\u00e1takas, R\u00e1hula is mentioned as having been the Bodhisatta's son -  e.g., in the Uraga, Kapi (No. 250), Kumbhak\u00e1ra, Khandah\u00e1la, Culla Sutasoma, Daddara, Bandhan\u00e1g\u00e1ra, Makkata, Makhadeva, Mah\u00e1janaka, Mah\u00e1sudassana, Vidhurapandita, Vessantara, S\u00edhakotthuka and Sonaka. He was also Ya\u00f1\u00f1adatta, son of Mandavya (S\u00e1riputta) and the young tortoise in the Mah\u00e1ukkusa. The Apad\u00e1na (ii.551) says that in many births Uppalavann\u00e1 and R\u00e1hula were born of the same parents (ekasmim sambhave) and had similar tendencies (sam\u00e1nacchandam\u00e1nas\u00e1).</p><p>R\u00e1hula was known to his friends as R\u00e1hulabhadda (R\u00e1hula, the Lucky). He himself says (Thag. vs. 295f ) that he deserved the title because he was twice blest in being the son of the Buddha and an arahant himself. Mention is often made in the books (DhA.i.124; MA.i.537; Mil.410 attributes this statement to S\u00e1riputta; SNA.i.202 expands it to include others) that, though R\u00e1hula was his own son, the Buddha showed as much love for Devadatta, Angulim\u00e1la and Dhanap\u00e1la as he did for R\u00e1hula.</p><p>Asoka built a th\u00fapa in honour of R\u00e1hula, to be specially worshipped by novices.

It consists of a series of lessons given by the Buddha to R\u00e1hula, showing him the fleeting nature of all things (S.ii.244 56). Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.635f ) that these suttas were preached on various occasions, from the time R\u00e1hula entered the Order, to the time of his attainment of arahantship.

R\u00e1hula Sutta</h4><p>The Buddha tells R\u00e1hula that a monk should cultivate the thought that, in the four elements, either in one's own body or in external objects, there is neither self nor what pertains to the self.

R\u00e1hula Sutta</h4><p>R\u00e1hula visits the Buddha and asks him how to get rid of the insidious idea of \"I\" and \"mine,\" both with regard to one's own body and with all external objects. The Buddha replies that one should see things as they really are, that in none of the five khandhas is there any \"I\" or \"mine.\" This is right insight. S.iii.135; this sutta is given at S.ii.252 as Anusaya Sutta. Buddhaghosa describes both this sutta and the next as R\u00e1hulov\u00e1da vipassan\u00e1 (AA.ii.547).</p><hr><h4>3.

He should, therefore, associate with good friends, in good surroundings. He should be free from attachment to food or clothes. He should free his mind from all evil tendencies and fill it with thoughts of renunciation. SN. vv. 335 42.

Ratthap\u00e1la Thera</h4><p>Chief of those who had left the world through faith (saddh\u00e1pabbajit\u00e1nam) (A.i.24). He was born at Thullakotthita in the Kuru country as the son of a very wealthy councillor and was called by his family name of Ratthap\u00e1la. Given to the family because it retrieved the fortunes of a disrupted kingdom, says the Commentary. He lived in great luxury, and, in due course, married a suitable wife. When the Buddha visited Thullakotthita, Ratthap\u00e1la went to hear him preach and decided to leave the world. His parents would not, however, give their consent till he threatened to starve himself to death. Realizing then that he was in earnest, they agreed to let him go on condition that he would visit them after his ordination. Ratthap\u00e1la accompanied the Buddha to S\u00e1vatthi, and there, dwelling alone, he attained arahantship within a short time (But MA.ii.725 says he took twelve years, during which time he never slept on a bed, DA.iii.236). Then, with the Buddha's permission, he returned to Thullakotthita and dwelt in the deer park of the Kuru king. The day after his arrival, while begging for alms, he came to his father's house. His father was in the entrance hall having his hair combed, but, failing to recognize his son, he started to abuse him, taking him for an ordinary monk, one of those who had robbed him of his son. Just at that moment the slave girl of the house was about to throw away some stale rice, which Ratthap\u00e1la begged of her. The girl recognized his voice, gave him the rice and told his parents who he was. When his father came to look for his son, he found him eating stale rice as though it were ambrosia. (This eating of stale rice made of him an aggaariyavamsika, Sp.i.208; MA.ii.726). Having already finished eating, when invited to enter the house, he would not do so,", "but on the next day he went again, and his father tried to tempt him by making a display of the immense wealth which would be his should he return to the lay life, while his former wives, beautifully clothed, asked him about the nymphs, for whose sake he led the homeless life. \"For the sake of no nymphs, Sisters,\" he said, and they fell fainting under the shock of being addressed as \"Sisters.\" Growing impatient at the conduct of his family, he asked for his meal, ate it, preached to them (Buddhaghosa says that according to the Commentators of India, parasamuddav\u00e1s\u00edther\u00e1n\u00e1m, he preached standing; the stanzas so preached are given in M.i.64f. and again in Thag.769-75) on the impermanence of all things, the futility of wealth, the snare of beauty, etc., and returned to Mig\u00e1c\u00edra. Through the air, says the Commentary (ThagA.ii.34; MA.ii.730), because his father put bolts on the house and tried to keep him there. He also sent men to remove his yellow robes and clothe him in white.</p><p>There the Kuru king, who was feasting there, and had often heard of Ratthap\u00e1la's fame, visited him. Their conversation is recorded in the Ratthap\u00e1la Sutta. Ratthap\u00e1la then returned to the Buddha. Ratthap\u00e1la's story is given in M.ii.54ff.; MA.ii.722; ThagA.ii.30ff.; AA.i.144ff., cp. Avadas. ii.118ff.; Mtu.iii.41, n.1.</p><p>In a previous birth, before the appearance of Padumuttara Buddha, Ratthap\u00e1la was one of two rich householders of Hamsavat\u00ed, both of whom spent their wealth in good deeds. They once waited on two companies of ascetics from Himav\u00e1; the ascetics left, but their leaders remained, and the two householders looked after them till they died. After death, one of them (Ratthap\u00e1la) was reborn as Sakka, while the other was born as the N\u00e1ga king P\u00e1lita (v.l. Pathavindhara), who, in this Buddha age, became R\u00e1hula. At Sakka's request, P\u00e1lita gave alms to", "Padumuttara and wished to be like the Buddha's son, Uparevata. Sakka himself entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days and wished to resemble the monk Ratthap\u00e1la, whom Padumuttara Buddha had declared to be foremost among those who had joined the Order through faith. Padumuttara declared that the wish of both would be fulfilled in the time of Gotama Buddha.</p><p>MA.ii.722; ThagA.ii.30 differs in many details; it makes no mention of P\u00e1lita, and says that in Padumuttara's time, too, the householder's name was Ratthap\u00e1la. The name of the monk, disciple of Padumuttara, whose example incited the householder to wish for similar honour, is not given. This account adds (see also AA.i.143f.) that in the time of Phussa Buddha (q.v.) he was one of those in charge of the almsgiving held in the Buddha's honour by his three step brothers. Bimbis\u00e1ra and Vis\u00e1kha were his colleagues (AA.i.165). The Ap.i.63f is again different. It says that in Padumuttara's time the householder gave the Buddha an elephant with all its trappings, and then, buying it back, built with the money a sangh\u00e1-r\u00e1ma containing fifty four thousand rooms. As a result he was king of the gods fifty times and Cakkavatti fifty eight times. AA.i.141 gives the story at greater length, some of the minor details varying.</p><p>Ratthap\u00e1la is mentioned (E.g., SNA.i.232; at AA.ii.596 Yasa's name is added ) with Sona-setthiputta as one who enjoyed great luxury as a householder. He is an example (DA.ii.642; SA.iii.201; VibhA.306; DhA.iv.195) of one who attained to the higher knowledge through resolution (chandam dhuram katv\u00e1). The Vinayapitaka (Vin.iii.148; Ratthap\u00e1la is here called a kulaputta. The incident probably refers to his lay life) contains a stanza quoted by the Buddha, in which Ratthap\u00e1la's father enquires of his son why the latter never asked him for anything. \"Because begging is a degrading thing,\" says Ratthap\u00e1la.</p>", "<hr><p><b>2.

It contains an account of Ratthap\u00e1la's admission into the Order, his visits to his parents after attaining arahantship, and his conversation with the Kuru king in the latter's Deer Park. This last conversation forms the chief theme. The king asks Ratthap\u00e1la why he has left his home when he suffers neither from old age, failing health, poverty, nor death of kinsfolk. Ratthap\u00e1la answers that his reason for leaving it was his conviction of the truth of the four propositions enunciated by the Buddha   that the world (1) is in a state of continual flux and change; (2) there is no protector or preserver; (3) in it, we own nothing, but must leave all behind us; (4) it lacks and bankers, being enslaved by craving. These four propositions are referred to as Catt\u00e1ro dhammuddes\u00e1 (MA.i.361).</p><p>He explains the meaning of these statements to the satisfaction of the king and summarizes his statements in a series of stanzas.

(See also Rockhill, op. cit., where various other names are given as well). It is probable that the name of Gotama's wife was Bimb\u00e1, and that Bhaddakacc\u00e1, Subhaddak\u00e1, Yosadh\u00e1ri and the others, were descriptive epithets applied to her, which later became regarded as, additional names. It is also possible that in Gotama's court there was also a Yasodhar\u00e1, daughter of Dandap\u00e1n\u00ed, and that there was a later confusion of names. The Commentarial explanation (E.g., AA.i.204), that she was called Bhaddakacc\u00e1n\u00e1 because her body was the colour of burnished gold, is probably correct. To suggest (E.g., Thomas, op. cit., 49) that the name bears any reference to the Kacc\u00e1nagotta seems to be wrong, because the Kacc\u00e1na was a brahmin gotta and the S\u00e1kiyans were not brahmins.</p><p>R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1 was born on the same day as the Bodhisatta (J.i.54; BuA. 106, 228). She married him (Gotama) at the age of sixteen (the following account is taken chiefly from J.i.58ff), and was placed at the head of forty thousand women, given to Gotama by the S\u00e1kiyans, after he had proved his manly prowess to", "their satisfaction. Gotama left the household life on the day of the birth of his son R\u00e1hula (according to one account, referred to in the J\u00e1taka Commentary, i.62, R\u00e1hula was seven days old). It is said that just before he left home he took a last look at his wife from the door of her room, not daring to go nearer, lest he should awake her. When the Buddha paid his first visit to Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment, and on the second day of that visit, he begged in the street for alms. This news spread, and R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1 looked out of her window to see if it were true. She saw the Buddha, and was so struck by the glory of his personality that she uttered eight verses in its praise. These verses have been handed down under the name of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/narasihagata')\">Naras\u00edhag\u00e1th\u00e1</a>; on that day, after the Buddha had finished his meal in the palace, which he took at the invitation of Suddhodana, all the ladies of the court, with the exception of R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1, went to pay him obeisance. She refused to go, saying that if she had any virtue in her the Buddha would come to her. The Buddha went to her with his two chief Disciples and gave orders that she should be allowed to greet him as she wished. She fell at his feet, and clasping them with her hands, put her head on them. Suddhodana related to the Buddha how, from the time he had left home, R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1 had herself abandoned all luxury and had lived in the same manner as she had heard that the Buddha lived -  wearing yellow robes, eating only once a day, etc. And the Buddha then related the<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/c/candakinnara_jat_485')\">Candakinnara J\u00e1taka</a>, to show how, in the past, too, her loyalty had been supreme.</p><p>On the seventh day of the Buddha's visit, when he left the palace at the end of his meal, R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1 sent R\u00e1hula to him saying, \"That is your father, go and", "ask him for your inheritance.\" R\u00e1hula followed the Buddha, and, at the Buddha's request, was ordained by S\u00e1riputta. The account of this event is given in Vin.i.82; this is probably the only passage in the Pitakas where R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1, is mentioned by name.</p><p>Later, when the Buddha allowed women to join the Order, R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1 became a nun under <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')\">Mah\u00e1 Paj\u00e1pat\u00ed Gotam\u00ed</a> (AA.i.198).</p><p><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')\">Buddhaghosa</a> identifies (AA.i.204f) R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1 with Bhaddakacc\u00e1n\u00e1 who, in the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya (A.i.25), is mentioned as chief among nuns in the possession of supernormal powers (mah\u00e1bhi\u00f1\u00f1appatt\u00e1nam).

Mtu.iii.138, 254). The Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya (S.i.49f) says that on one occasion when he seized Candim\u00e1 (Moon god), and on another Suriya (Sun god), both these invoked the aid of the Buddha. The Buddha then instructed R\u00e1hu to let them free. R\u00e1hu immediately let them go and ran to Vepacitti, \"trembling and with stiffened hair.\" This incident evidently refers to the Indian myth of the eclipses, and the legend has been annexed by the Buddhists to illustrate the Buddha's power and pity.</p><p>Elsewhere (A.ii.17) R\u00e1hu is spoken of as the chief of those possessing personality (attabh\u00e1va). The Commentaries (E.g., AA.ii.474; DA.ii.487f.; MA.ii.790; SA.i.86, contains more details and differs slightly) explain that he is four thousand eight hundred leagues in height, and that the breadth of his chest is one thousand two hundred yojanas. His hands and feet are two hundred leagues long, each finger joint measuring fifty leagues, the space between the eyebrows also measuring fifty leagues. His forehead is fifty leagues broad, and his head nine hundred leagues in height. His face measures one hundred leagues, his nose three hundred, and the depth of his mouth one hundred. He is jealous of the gods of the Sun and the Moon, and stands in their paths with wide open mouth. When they fall into his mouth, the gods abandon their abodes and flee for their lives. Sometimes he caresses their abodes with his hand only, or with the lower part of his jaw, or with his tongue. Sometimes he takes them up and places them against his cheek; but he cannot stop the course of either the Sun or the Moon; if he attempts to do so, he will meet with disaster. So he journeys along with them.</p><p>The seizure of the Moon by R\u00e1hu and the escape from him is often used as a", "simile (E.g., SN. vs. 465; J.i.183, 274; iii.364, 377; iv.330; v.453; DhA.iv.19, etc.). R\u00e1hu is one of the four \"stains\" (upakkiles\u00e1) of the Sun and the Moon, preventing them from shining in all their glory (A.ii.53; Vin.ii.295; cp. J.iii.365). He is further mentioned as one of the five causes of lack of rain (vassassa antar\u00e1ya). When he gathers water into his hands and spills it into the ocean, there is no rain (A.iii.243). The idea seems to be that he gathers up the rain water which is in the sky in order to cool his body.</p><p>To bring R\u00e1hu down from the sky is mentioned as one of the impossible tasks (J.iii.477).</p><p>It is said (DA.i.285; MA.ii.790f ) that for a long time R\u00e1hu did not visit the Buddha, he thought that being so tall he would fail to see the Buddha. One day, however, he decided to go, and the Buddha, aware of his intention, lay on a bed when he arrived, and, by his iddhi power, contrived to make himself so tall that R\u00e1hu had to crane his neck to see his face. R\u00e1hu, thereupon, confessed his folly and accepted the Buddha as his teacher.</p><p>R\u00e1hu is mentioned (D.ii.259) as being among the Asuras who were present at the Mah\u00e1smaya and as blessing that assembly. In this context he is called R\u00e1hubhadda. When R\u00e1hu steps into the ocean, the water of the deepest part reaches only to his knees (DA.ii.488). R\u00e1hu is also called Veroca, and B\u00e1li's hundred sons were called after him, he being their uncle (DA.ii.689). The name R\u00e1humukha is given to a form of torture (E.g., M.i.87; iii.164; Nid.154; Mil.197, 358), in which the victim's mouth is forced open by a stake and fire or spikes are sent through the orifice of the ear into the mouth, which becomes filled with blood (AA.i.293).</p><hr><hr>"]}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2><b>Ratanag\u00e1ma</b></h2>  </li></ul><p>A village in Ceylon given by Aggabodhi I. as a   maintenance village to the Unnavalli vih\u00e1ra.

The monks refused his request on the ground of his age, so he sought the Buddha who, seeing his upanissaya, asked S\u00e1riputta to admit him.* Soon after he won arahantship. </p><p>He stayed near the Buddha, and, by reason of his skill, the Buddha declared him foremost among those who could inspire speech in others (? patibh\u00e1nakeyy\u00e1nam) (A.i.25; ThagA.i.253f). </p><p>He thereby earned the name of Patibh\u00e1niya Thera (SA.ii.246). </p><p>The Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 (vss.133 4) contains two verses spoken by him in praise of concentration of the mind. </p><p>The R\u00e1dha Samyutta (S.iii.188 201; see also <a href=\"radha_sutta')\">R\u00e1dha Sutta</a>) contains a large number of suttas preached by the Buddha in answer to R\u00e1dha's questions on various topics. </p><p>It is said that when the Buddha saw R\u00e1dha he felt the inclination to talk on matters dealing with subtle topics, illustrating them with various similes. SA.ii.246; this was because of Radha's wealth of views (ditthisamud\u00e1c\u00e1ra) and", "unwavering faith (okappaniya-saddh\u00e1); AA.i.179; also ThagA.i.254.</p><hr><blockquote>  <p>* It is probably this incident which is referred to at ThagA.ii.114, where   S\u00e1riputta is said to have ordained a poor brahmin named R\u00e1dha, but no mention   is made of any order from the Buddha. If the reference is to this same thera,   R\u00e1dha was, for some time, the attendant (pacch\u00e1samana) of S\u00e1riputta, and there   is a verse in Thag. (993) spoken to him by S\u00e1riputta, who was pleased with   R\u00e1dha's gentle manner. DhA.ii.104ff. gives more details of the ordination of   R\u00e1dha. There we are told that he went to the monastery where he performed   various duties. But the monks would not admit him into the Order, and, owing   to his disappointment, he grew thin. One day the Buddha, seeing him with his   divine eye, went to him, and hearing of his wish to join the Order, summoned   the monks and asked if any of them remembered any favour done by R\u00e1dha.   S\u00e1riputta mentioned that he had once received a ladleful of R\u00e1dha\u2019s own food   while begging in R\u00e1jagaha. The Buddha then suggested that S\u00e1riputta should   listen to R\u00e1dha\u2019s request for ordination. After ordination, R\u00e1dha grew weary   of the food of the refectory, but S\u00e1riputta constantly admonished him and   found him most humble; later, he spoke highly of R\u00e1dha's obedience, and the   Buddha praised him. It was on R\u00e1dha's account that the   <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/am/aliinacitta_jat_156')\">Al\u00ednacitta J\u00e1taka</a> was preached. AA.i.179f. agrees, more or less, with the account given   above; so does Ap.ii.485f.</p></blockquote><hr><p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, R\u00e1dha was a householder of Hamsavat\u00ed and held a great almsgiving in honour of the Buddha, wishing to gain pre eminence in the power of inspiring others to speak. He gave ripe mangoes to Vipass\u00ed Buddha", "(ThagA.i.253; AA.i.180; Ap.ii.484) and, as a result, was born in heaven.</p><p><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/suraadha_thera')\">Sur\u00e1dha Thera</a> was his younger brother.

Rakkha</h4><p>A general of Parakkamab\u00e1hu I. He was originally the Dand\u00e1dhin\u00e1yaka (? general) of Gajab\u00e1hu, but Parakkamab\u00e1hu won him over and put him in charge of the conquest of the Malaya country. He accomplished this with the help of his younger brother, after fighting many battles and subduing the chiefs of the various districts (Cv.lxx.5ff). The king thereupon conferred on him the rank of Kesadh\u00e1tu. Later, he subdued the district of Merukandara and was sent against the Mah\u00e1lekha Mahinda, whom he defeated at Sarog\u00e1matittha. He was associated with Nagaragiri N\u00e1tha in the fight against M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana near Badaravall\u00ed. After this he is referred to as Adhik\u00e1r\u00ed Rakkha, and the war against M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana seems to have been chiefly in his charge. He was in command of the army at Mangalabeg\u00e1ma and Mihiranabibbila, and decisively defeated M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana's general, Buddhan\u00e1yaka at Rajataked\u00e1ra. Later, when Queen Sugal\u00e1 raised a revolt in Rohana, it was Rakkha who was sent to crush it. He was by now commander in chief, and was helped in the subjugation of Rohana by the general Bh\u00fata. They fought a battle at Lokagalla and advanced to Majjhimag\u00e1ma and occupied Uddhanadv\u00e1ra, where Rakkha was helped by the two Kittis, the Adhik\u00e1ri and the J\u00edvapotthak\u00ed. From there they marched to Mah\u00e1r\u00edvara, and at Badaguna crushed Sugal\u00e1's forces, thus gaining possession of the Sacred Bowl and the Sacred Tooth which these forces were carrying. In a last onslaught at Dematavala, Rakkha put the enemy to flight and marched on to Sappan\u00e1rukokilla, where he died of an attack of dysentery. Cv.lxx. 5, 15, 19, 282, 295; lxxii.2ff., 107, 160, 207, 232, 265ff.; lxxiv. 41ff. 55, 72ff., 111ff., 136ff.</p><hr><h4>2. Rakkha</h4><p>called Lank\u00e1dhin\u00e1tha. A general of Parakkamab\u00e1hu I. He helped Lokajitv\u00e1na to", "defeat Hukitti, and was later sent to Janapada to fight against Gajab\u00e1hu's forces. He was successful, and occupied Yag\u00e1lla and Tal\u00e1tthala. Gajab\u00e1hu tried to win him over with bribes, but Rakkha mutilated the envoys and sent the presents to Parakkamab\u00e1hu. He fought at Alig\u00e1ma against Gajab\u00e1hu's general, S\u00edka, and, proving victorious, held a great celebration. Later he was in charge of the successful attack on Pulatthipura, when the city was captured and Gajab\u00e1hu taken prisoner. He was then sent to Mangalabeg\u00e1ma against M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana, and fought so fiercely that the latter was forced to flee to Rohana. Rakkha was placed in charge of the ford at Nigundiv\u00e1luk\u00e1. He was, however, greatly offended by the favour shown by Parakkamab\u00e1hu to his rival, the Sen\u00e1pati Deva, and no longer showed himself zealous in war. An officer of Gajab\u00e1hu who was with Rakkha, noticing this, sent word to M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana to come at once and take advantage of Rakkha's lethargy. M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana followed this advice and advanced against Rakkha, whom he killed in the course of a fierce battle.

He was an officer of Parakkamab\u00e1hu I. and took part in the campaigns against M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana, being stationed at Mangalabeg\u00e1ma, at Pillavitthi. At this place he fought a battle, which lasted for eight days, against Buddhan\u00e1yaka and Mah\u00e1m\u00e1ladeva, and brought the district of K\u00e1lav\u00e1pi under his power. Cv.lxxii.161, 170ff., 182, 206.</p><hr><h4>4. Rakkha</h4><p>called Damil\u00e1dhik\u00e1ri. He was an officer of Parakkamab\u00e1hu I., and was one of those chiefly responsible for the subjugation of Rohana. He fought battles at Donivagga, Guralatthakala\u00f1cha, P\u00fagadandak\u00e1v\u00e1ta, Bodhi\u00e1v\u00e1ta, Bhinn\u00e1lavan\u00e1g\u00e1ma and several other places, and inflicted severe defeats on the rebel forces, dealing", "them a severe blow at Mah\u00e1senag\u00e1ma, where Lank\u00e1pura Rakkha was killed. This enabled him to take possession of Mah\u00e1n\u00e1gahula. In order to bring the province completely under his control he had to fight further at Bakagalla Uddhav\u00e1pi, Sanghabhedakag\u00e1ma, Kuravakagalla and Mah\u00e1pabbata, and he thus won full possession of Dv\u00e1dasasahassaka, where he seems to have spent the rest of his days.

The building of this city was hastened on by a threatened invasion by the king of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')\">Ves\u00e1li</a>. The city was called R\u00e1jagaha because Bimbis\u00e1ra was the first person to occupy it. Both Hiouen Thsang and Fa Hsien (Giles: 49) record another tradition which ascribed the foundation of the new city to <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')\">Aj\u00e1tasattu</a>.</p><p>Pargiter (Ancient Ind. Historical Tradition, p.149) suggests that the old city was called Kus\u00e1grapura, after Kus\u00e1gra, an early king of Magadha. In the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana (i. 7, 32) the city is called Vasumat\u00ed. The Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata gives other names -  B\u00e1rhadrathapura (ii.24, 44), Var\u00e1ha, Vrsabha, Rsigiri, Caityaka (see PHAI.,p.70).  </p><p>It was also called Bimbis\u00e1rapur\u00ed and Magadhapura (SNA.ii.584).</p><p>But both names were used indiscriminately (E.g., S.N. vs. 405), though Giribbaja seems, as a name, to have been restricted to verse passages. The place", "was called Giribbaja (mountain stronghold) because it was surrounded by five hills -  Pandava, Gijjhak\u00fata, Vebh\u00e1ra, Isigili and Vepulla* - and R\u00e1jagaha, because it was the seat of many kings, such as Mandh\u00e1t\u00e1 and Mah\u00e1govinda (SNA.ii.413). It would appear, from the names given of the kings, that the city was a very ancient royal capital. In the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545')\">Vidhurapandita J\u00e1taka</a> (J.vi.271), R\u00e1jagaha is called the capital of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga')\">Anga</a>.

He visited it soon after the Renunciation, journeying there on foot from the River Anom\u00e1, a distance of thirty leagues (J.i.66). Bimbis\u00e1ra saw him begging in the street, and, having discovered his identity and the purpose of his quest, obtained from him a promise of a visit to R\u00e1jagaha as soon as his aim should be achieved (See the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pabbajja_sutta')\">Pabbajj\u00e1 Sutta</a> and its Commentary).

According to the Mah\u00e1 Vamsa, (Mhv.xxxi.21; MT. 564) some time later, acting on the suggestion of Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, the king gathered at R\u00e1jagaha seven donas of the Buddha's relics which had been deposited in various places -", "excepting those deposited at R\u00e1mag\u00e1ma -  and built over them a large th\u00fapa.

According to the Commentaries (SNA.i.278ff.; DhA.iii.436ff.; KhpA.164f), the Buddha first taught the sutta to Ananda and asked him to go round the city, accompanied by the Licchavi princes, reciting the sutta and sprinkling water from the Buddha's bowl.

He was only seven years old, and, on the wedding day, the relations of both bride and bridegroom showered blessings on the couple and said to the bride: \"May you live as long as your grandmother.\" Revata asked to see the grandmother, and was shown a woman of one hundred and twenty, decrepit, and showing all the signs of advanced old age. Realizing that his wife would probably share the same fate, he left the bridal procession on some pretext on the way home, and ran away to a place where some monks lived. S\u00e1riputta, foreseeing this, had instructed the monks to ordain his brother without reference to his parents, and, when Revata revealed his identity, the monks at once admitted him into the Order.</p><p>When S\u00e1riputta heard this, he wished to visit his brother, but was persuaded by the Buddha to wait. Revata, after waiting a long time for the visit from S\u00e1riputta, obtained from his teachers a formula of meditation and himself set out to see the Buddha.

Once, during a visit to S\u00e1vatthi, he stayed in a forest near the city. The police, on the track of some thieves, came upon him, and, finding him near the booty which the thieves had dropped in their flight, arrested him and brought him before the king. When the king questioned him, the Elder spoke a series of verses (Thag.646 58; Mrs. Rhys Davids speaks of Revata as a teacher of the Jain doctrine of ahims\u00e1, Gotama the Man, p.116), demonstrating the impossibility of his committing such an act, and also by way of teaching the king the Dhamma. It is said (ThagA.l.555) that at the conclusion of the stanzas he sat cross legged in the sky until his body burnt itself out.</p><p>Revata loved solitude, and, on one occasion (DhA.iii.325f), a lay disciple named Atula, hearing that he was in S\u00e1vatthi, went with five hundred others to hear him preach. But Revata said that he delighted in solitude and refused to address them, and Atula went away complaining.</p><p>Revata's delight in solitude was sometimes misunderstood. For instance, the Elder Sanun\u00f1jani went about continually sweeping, and, seeing Revata sitting cross legged, thought him an idler. Revata read his thoughts and admonished him.</p><p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Revata was a boatman at Pay\u00e1ga on the Ganges, and once took the Buddha and his thousand followers across the river in a boat decked with canopies, flowers, etc. On that occasion he heard the Buddha declare one of the monks highest among forest dwellers, and wished for a similar honour for himself under a future Buddha (ThagA.i.108; A.A.i.126).

At his suggestion, Apar\u00e1ijita (According to DhA.iii.364, both uncle and nephew were called Avaroja) built for the Buddha a very costly Gandhakuti, with the seven kinds of precious things.

One day a brahmin tried to carry away a very", "costly jewel, which much annoyed Apar\u00e0jita.

When the time came for his marriage, <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')\">Sakka</a> provided for him a palace, seven storeys high, made entirely of precious minerals. Four urns of treasure stood at the four corners and four stalks of sugar-cane made of solid gold, each the size of a palmyra tree with leaves of precious stones, to remind Jotika of his good deed in the past. Seven Yakkhas guarded the seven gates - Yamakol\u00ed, Uppala, Vajira, Vajirab\u00e1hu, Kasakanda, Katattha and Dis\u00e1p\u00e1mukha - each with numerous followers.

Whenever they wished to eat, they would put rice over the boiler and set it over the crystals. The stones would immediately become alight and, when the meal was cooked, would extinguish themselves. The pot was inexhaustible. All who came to visit Jotika were provided with food and were allowed to take anything they wished from the treasure, the treasure never growing less. So great were the crowds which flocked to Jotika's palace that for", "a long time Bimbis\u00e1ra had no chance of seeing it. When Bimbis\u00e1ra did in the end visit him with Aj\u00e1tasattu, Jotika invited him to a meal which was the most dainty the king had ever tasted. After the meal Jotika presented his wife to Bimbis\u00e1ra; so delicately was she nurtured that the perfume with which the king was scented hurt her eyes! There were no lamps in Jotika's house; only the light of jewels was made use of, and as a memento of Bimbis\u00e1ra's visit Jotika gave him a huge jewel to be used as a lamp.

But the Yakkha Yamakol\u00ed routed the army, and Aj\u00e1tasattu fled for refuge to the vih\u00e1ra where Jotika was listening to the Dhamma. On being charged by Aj\u00e1tasattu with hypocrisy in that he was there listening to the Dhamma, after having charged his guards to set upon the king, Jotika's answer was that he had no need of guards since nobody could take anything of his without his sanction. He then challenged the king to remove the rings from his (Jotika's) fingers. Aj\u00e1tasattu, trying with all his might, failed. Jotika then held out his hands and his rings all fell off. Agitated by the king's desire to possess his wealth, Jotika asked for permission to become a monk. Aj\u00e1tasattu agreed, hoping thus to get possession of his riches.

Two women, while bathing, saw the vessel, discovered what it contained and each claimed the child. The dispute was settled by the king and the child was given to the woman who happened to be a disciple of Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na. The child was called Jatila because the first time he was bathed after birth his hair became matted. When able to walk, he was given to Mah\u00e1 Kacc\u00e1na to be ordained, but the thera took him to Takkasil\u00e1 and handed him over to one of his supporters, a merchant, who adopted him as his son. Years passed, and one day the merchant, having to go on a journey, made a list of the goods which he had accumulated in his house during twelve years and asked Jatila to sell them if he could find buyers. Such was the lad's fortune that in one day they were all disposed of. The merchant, realising the young man's destiny, gave him his daughter in marriage and provided him with a house. As Jatila stepped into the house, the earth behind it was rent asunder and a mountain of gold,", "eighty cubits in height, appeared for his use. Thereupon the king made him a Treasurer. Later, wishing to retire from the world, Jatila sent out messengers to discover if there were others as rich as he, in case the king should raise objections to his going away. When news was brought back of Mendaka and Jotika, he knew there would be no opposition and obtained the king's permission. He had three sons, but, having tested them, came to know that only the youngest had the necessary good fortune to enjoy his vast wealth. Jatila thereupon handed over to him his wealth and entered the Order, becoming an arahant within a few days. Some time afterwards the Buddha, with Jatila and other monks, was entertained for a fortnight by Jatila's sons, and in answer to the monks' questions Jatila declared that he felt no desire to re-enter household life.

Of his three sons whom he asked, in turn, to help him with the preparations, only the youngest consented to go with him.

When the Buddha accepted An\u00e1thapindika's invitation to visit S\u00e1vatthi the latter, seeking a suitable place for the Buddha's residence, discovered this park belonging to Jetakum\u00e1ra (MA.i.471 says it was in the south of S\u00e1vatthi). When he asked to be allowed to buy it, Jeta's reply was: \"Not even if you could cover the whole place with money.\" An\u00e1thapindika said that he would buy it at that price, and when Jeta answered that he had had no intention of making a bargain, the matter was taken before the Lords of Justice, who decided that if the price mentioned were paid, An\u00e1thapindika had the right of purchase. An\u00e1thapindika had gold brought down in carts and covered Jetavana with pieces laid side by side. (This incident is illustrated in a bas-relief at the Bharhut Tope; see Cunningham - the St\u00fapa of Bharhut, Pl.lvii., pp.84-6). The money brought in the first journey was found insufficient to cover one small spot near the gateway. So An\u00e1thapindika sent his servants back for more, but Jeta, inspired by An\u00e1thapindika's earnestness, asked to be allowed to give this spot. An\u00e1thapindika agreed and Jeta erected there a gateway, with a room over it. An\u00e1thapindika built in the grounds dwelling rooms, retiring rooms, store rooms and service halls, halls with fireplaces, closets, cloisters, halls for exercise, wells, bathrooms, ponds, open and roofed sheds, etc. (Vin.ii.158f).</p><p>It is said (MA.i.50; UdA.56f) that An\u00e1thapindika paid eighteen crores for the purchase of the site, all of which Jeta spent in the construction of the gateway gifted by him. (The gateway was evidently an imposing structure; see J.ii.216).</p><p>Jeta gave, besides, many valuable trees", "for timber. An\u00e1thapindika himself spent fifty-four crores in connection with the purchase of the park and the buildings erected in it.</p><p>The ceremony of dedication was one of great splendour. Not only An\u00e1thapindika himself, but his whole family took part: his son with five hundred other youths, his wife with five hundred other noble women, and his daughters Mah\u00e1 Subhadd\u00e1 and C\u00fala Subhadd\u00e1 with five hundred other maidens. An\u00e1thapindika was attended by five hundred bankers. The festivities in connection with the dedication lasted for nine months (J.i.92ff).</p><p>Some of the chief buildings attached to the Jetavana are mentioned in the books by special names, viz., Mah\u00e1gandhakuti, Kaverimandalam\u00e1la, Kosambakuti and Candanam\u00e1la.

According to Tibetan sources the vih\u00e1ra was built according to a plan sent by the devas of Tusita and contained sixty large halls and sixty small. The Dulva also gives details of the decorative scheme of the vih\u00e1ra (Rockhill: op. cit.48 and n.2).</p><p>All these were built by An\u00e1thapindika; there was another large building erected by Pasenadi and called the Salalaghara (DA.ii.407). Over the gateway lived a guardian deity to prevent all evildoers from entering (SA.i.239). Just outside the monastery was a r\u00e1jayatana-tree, the residence of the god Samiddhisumana (Mhv.i.52f; MT 105; but see DhA.i.41, where the guardian of the gateway is called Sumana).</p><p>In the grounds there seems to have been a large pond which came to be called the Jetavanapokkharan\u00ed.

(J.iv.228f). Not far from the gateway was a cave which became famous as the Kapallap\u00favapabbh\u00e1ra on account of an incident connected with Macchariya-Kosiya (J.i.348).</p><p>Near Jetavana was evidently a monastery of the heretics where Ci\u00f1c\u00e1m\u00e1navik\u00e1 spent her nights while hatching her conspiracy against the Buddha. (DhA.iii.179; behind Jetavana was a spot where the Ajivakas practised their austerities (J.i.493). Once the heretics bribed Pasenadi to let them make a rival settlement behind Jetavana, but the Buddha frustrated their plans (J.ii.170)). </p><p>There seems to have been a playground just outside Jetavana used by the children of the neighbourhood, who, when thirsty, would go into Jetavana to drink (DhA.iii.492). The high road to S\u00e1vatthi passed by the edge of Jetavana, and travellers would enter the park to rest and refresh themselves (J.ii.203, 341; see also vi.70, where two roads are mentioned). </p><p>According to the Divy\u00e1vad\u00e1na (Dvy.395f), the th\u00fapas of S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na were in the grounds of Jetavana and existed until the time of Asoka. Both Fa Hien (Giles: p.33ff) and Houien Thsang (Beal.ii.7ff) give descriptions of other incidents connected with the Buddha, which took place in the neighbourhood of Jetavana - e.g., the murder of Sundarik\u00e1, the calumny of Ci\u00f1c\u00e1, Devadatta's attempt to poison the Buddha, etc.</p><p>The space covered by the four bedposts of the Buddha's Gandhakuti in Jetavana is one of the four avijahitatth\u00e1n\u00e1ni; all Buddhas possess the same, though the size of the actual vih\u00e1ra differs in the case of the various Buddhas. For Vipass\u00ed Buddha, the setthi Punabbasumitta built", "a monastery extending for a whole league, while for Sikh\u00ed, the setthi Sirivaddha made one covering three gavutas. The Sangh\u00e1r\u00e1ma built by Sotthiya for Vessabh\u00fa was half a league in extent, while that erected by Accuta for Kakusandha covered only one g\u00e1vuta. Konagamana's monastery, built by the setthi Ugga, extended for half a g\u00e1vuta, while Kassapa's built by Sumangala covered sixteen kar\u00edsas. An\u00e1thapindika's monastery covered a space of eighteen kar\u00edsas (BuA.2, 47; J.i.94; DA.ii.424).</p><p>The Buddha spent nineteen rainy seasons in Jetavana (DhA.i.3; BuA.3; AA.i.314). It is said that after the Mig\u00e1ram\u00e1tup\u00e1s\u00e1da came into being, the Buddha would dwell alternately in Jetavana and Mig\u00e1ram\u00e1tup\u00e1s\u00e1da, often spending the day in one and the night in the other (SNA.i.336).</p><p>According to a description given by Fa Hien (Giles, pp.31, 33), the vih\u00e1ra was originally in seven sections (storeys?) and was filled with all kinds of offerings, embroidered banners, canopies, etc., and the lamps burnt from dusk to dawn.</p><p>One day a rat, holding in its mouth a lamp wick, set fire to the banners and canopies, and all the seven sections were entirely destroyed. The vih\u00e1ra was later rebuilt in two sections. There were two main entrances, one on the east, one on the west, and Fa Hsien found th\u00fapas erected at all the places connected with the Buddha, each with its name inscribed.</p><p>The vih\u00e1ra is almost always referred to as Jetavane An\u00e1thapindikassa \u00c1r\u00e1ma. The Commentaries (MA.ii.50; UdA.56f, etc.) say that this was deliberate (at the Buddha's own suggestion pp.81-131; Beal: op. cit., ii.5 and Rockhill: p.49), in order that the names of both earlier and later owners might be recorded and that people might be reminded of two men, both very generous in the cause of the Religion, so that others might follow their example.

Candappajjota hated ghee, which was, however, the only remedy. J\u00edvaka prepared the medicine, prescribed it for the king, then rode away on the king's elephant Bhaddavatik\u00e1 before the king discovered the nature of the medicine. Pajjota, in a rage, ordered his capture and sent his slave K\u00e1ka after him. K\u00e1ka discovered J\u00edvaka breakfasting at Kosamb\u00ed and allowed himself to be persuaded to eat half a myrobalan, which purged him violently. J\u00edvaka explained to K\u00e1ka that he wished to delay his return; he told him why he had fled from the court and, having returned the elephant, proceeded to R\u00e1jagaha. Pajjota was cured and, as a token of his favour, sent J\u00edvaka a suit of S\u00edveyyaka cloth, which J\u00edvaka presented to the Buddha (Vin.i.268-81; AA.i.216). J\u00edvaka was greatly attracted by the Buddha. Once when the Buddha was ill, J\u00edvaka found it necessary to administer a purge, and he had fat rubbed into the Buddha's body and gave him a handful of lotuses to smell. J\u00edvaka was away when the purgative acted, and suddenly remembered that he had omitted to ask the Buddha to bathe in warm water to complete the cure. The Buddha read his thoughts and bathed as required. Vin.i.279f; DhA. (ii.164f), relates a like occurrence in another connection. When the Buddha's foot was injured by the splinter from the rock hurled by <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')\">Devadatta</a>, he had to be carried from<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maddakucci')\">Maddakucchi</a> to J\u00edvaka's Ambavana. There J\u00edvaka applied an astringent, and having bandaged the wound,", "left the city expecting to return in time to remove it. But by the time he did return, the city gates were closed and he could not enter. He was greatly worried because he knew that if the bandage remained on all night the Buddha would suffer intense pain. But the Buddha read his thoughts and removed the bandage. See also J.v.333.</p><p>After J\u00edvaka became a Sot\u00e1panna, he was anxious to visit the Buddha twice a day, and finding <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')\">Veluvana</a> too far away, he built a monastery with all its adjuncts in his own Ambavana in R\u00e1jagaha, which he gave to the Buddha and his monks (DA.i.133; MA.ii.590). When Bimbis\u00e1ra died, J\u00edvaka continued to serve Aj\u00e1tasattu, and was responsible for bringing him to the Buddha after his crime of parricide.

Many people, afflicted with disease and unable to pay for treatment by him, joined the Order in order that they might receive that treatment. On discovering that the Order was thus being made a convenience of, he asked the Buddha to lay down a rule that men afflicted with certain diseases should be refused entry into the Order (Vin.i.71ff). J\u00edvaka was declared by the Buddha chief among his lay followers loved by the people (aggam puggalappasann\u00e1nam) (A.i.26). He is included in a list of good men who have been assured of the realisation of deathlessness (A.iii.451; DhA.i.244, 247; J.i.116f).</p><p>At a meal once given by J\u00edvaka, the Buddha refused to be served until C\u00falapanthaka, who had been left out of the invitation, had been sent for.

When the Ajivakas discovered that he ate filth, they expelled him and he lived as a naked ascetic, practising all kinds of austerities and accepting no offerings save butter and honey placed on the tip of his tongue with the point of a blade of grass. His fame spread far. When he was fifty-five years old, the Buddha visited him and spent the night in a cave near his abode. During the night, Jambuka saw mighty gods come to pay homage to the Buddha and was so impressed that the next day he sought the Buddha's counsel. The Buddha told him of his past evil deeds which had condemned him to practise austerities for so long and counselled him to give up his evil ways. In the course of the sermon, Jambuka grew ashamed of his nakedness and the Buddha gave him a bath-robe. At the end of the discourse Jambuka became an arahant, and when the inhabitants of Anga and Magadha came to him with their offerings, he performed a miracle before them and paid homage to the Buddha, acknowledging him as his teacher.</p><p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jambuka was a monk and had a lay patron who looked after him. One day a pious monk came to his vih\u00e1ra, and the layman, being pleased with him, showed him much attention.

They had eminent followers such as high court officials (Vin.ii.166; iv.71) and that, for centuries at least, they retained an important position, is shown by their being thrice mentioned in the Asoka Edicts as receiving royal gifts (Hultsch: Asoka Inscriptions, see Index).</p><p>The doctrines held by the \u00c1j\u00edvaka are mentioned in several places, but the best known account is in the", "<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samannaphala_s')\">S\u00e1ma\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta</a> where they are attributed to Makkhali Gos\u00e1la by name (D.i.53-4. See also M.i.516f). He maintained that there is no cause or reason for either depravity or purity among beings. There is no such thing as intrinsic strength, or energy or human might or endeavour. All creatures, all beings, everything that has life, all are devoid of power, strength and energy; all are under the compulsion of the individual nature to which they are linked by destiny; it is solely by virtue of their birth in the six environments (chalabhij\u00e1tiyo) that they experience their pleasure or pain. The universe is divided into various classes of beings, of occupations and methods of production. There are eighty-four hundred thousand periods during which both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, shall at last make an end of pain. The pleasures and pain, measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of transmigration; there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof, neither excess nor deficiency.</p><p>The fundamental point in their teaching seems, therefore, to have been \"sams\u00e1ra-suddhi,\" purification through transmigration, which probably meant that all beings, all lives, all existent things, all living substances attain and must attain, perfection in course of time.</p><p>According to <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')\">Buddhaghosa</a> (DA.i.161), in the classification of the \u00c1j\u00edvaka:</p><ul>  <li><p>\"all beings\" (satt\u00e1) meant all kinds of animals, camels, cows, asses, etc.;  </p>  </li>  <li><p>\"all lives\" (p\u00e1n\u00e1) comprised all sensitive things and sentient creatures divided into those with one sense (ekendriya), those with two senses and so forth;  </p>", "</li>  <li><p>\"all existent things\" (bh\u00fat\u00e1) denoted all living beings divided into generic types - viz., those produced from an egg, or born from the womb, or sprung from moisture, or propagated from seed;</p>  </li>  <li><p>\"all living substances\" (jiv\u00e1) denoted rice, barley, wheat, etc.</p>  </li></ul><p>The division of men into six classes (chalabhij\u00e1tiyo) is noteworthy. Buddhaghosa describes these as being kanha, n\u00edla, lohita, halidda, sukka and paramasukka. This closely resembles the curious Jaina doctrine of the six Lesyas. Given, e.g., in the Uttar\u00e1dhy\u00e1yana Sutra (Jacobi's Jaina S\u00fatras ii.213). This seems to involve a conception of mind which is originally colourless by nature. The different colours (n\u00edla, etc.) are due to different habits or actions. The supreme spiritual effort consists in restoring mind to its original purity. Cp. with this the Buddha's teaching in A.iii.384ff. and M.i.36. </p><p>In the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya (iii.383-4) a similar doctrine is attributed to <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa')\">P\u00farana Kassapa</a>.</p><p>Gos\u00e1la's theory (D.i.54; see also S.iii.211) of the divisions of the universe into fourteen hundred thousand principle states of birth - (pamukhayoniyo) and into various methods of regeneration - viz.,  </p><ul>  <li><p>seven kinds of animate (sa\u00f1\u00f1igabbh\u00e1) production, i.e. by means of separate sexes;  </p>  </li>  <li><p>seven of inanimate (asa\u00f1\u00f1igabbh\u00e1), such as rice, barley, etc.;  </p>  </li>  <li><p>seven of production by grafting (niganthigabbh\u00e1), propagating by joints, such as sugar cane, etc. -  </p>  </li></ul><p>seems to show that the \u00c1j\u00edvaka believed in infinite gradations of existence, in the infinity of time, and also in the", "recurrent cycles of existence.

Fate (nigati) regulates everything, all things being unalterably fixed.

One day when he was hunting, the quarry escaped from where the king lay in wait and, according to custom, it became the king's duty to capture it. He, therefore, followed the animal for three leagues, killed it and, having cut it in half, carried it in a pingo. On his way back he happened to pass under the banyan tree which was the abode of the Yakkha \u00c1lavaka. The Yakkha had been granted a boon by the Yakkha-king, which allowed him to eat anybody who came within the shadow of the tree. Accordingly, he seized the king, but later released him on obtaining his promise that he would provide him at regular intervals with a human being and a bowl of food (SnA.i.217ff).  </p><p>For the rest of the story see \u00c1lavaka Yakkha.</p><hr><p><b>2. \u00c1lavaka.</b>-The <b>Yakkha</b> referred to above.  </p><p>King \u00c1lavaka, with the help of the Mayor of the town (Nagaraguttika) and his ministers, was able to keep his promise for some time, by sending criminals to the Yakkha.

Soon there were no criminals left, and each household was forced to contribute one child for sacrifice to the Yakkha.  </p><p>Then women, about to bring forth children, began to leave the king's capital. Twelve years passed in this manner and the only child left was the king's own son, \u00c1lavaka Kum\u00e1ra. When the king learnt this, he ordered the child to be dressed in all splendour and taken to the Yakkha. The Buddha, with his Eye of Compassion, saw what was going to happen and went to the Yakkha's abode.</p>", "<p>\u00c1lavaka was away at a meeting of the Yakkhas in Himav\u00e1. His doorkeeper Gadrabha admitted the Buddha, after warning him of the Yakkha's unmannerly nature. The Buddha went in and sat down on \u00c1lavaka's throne while Gadrabha went to Himav\u00e1 to announce to his master the Buddha's arrival. While the Buddha was there, preaching to \u00c1lavaka's women-folk, the Yakkhas <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satagira')\">S\u00e1t\u00e1gira</a> and <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata')\">Hemavata</a>, passing through the air on their way to the assembly in Himav\u00e1, being made aware of the Buddha's presence by their inability to fly over him, descended to \u00c1lavaka's palace and made obeisance to the Buddha before resuming their journey.</p><p>When \u00c1lavaka heard from Gadrabha and from S\u00e1t\u00e1gira and Hemavata of the Buddha's visit, he was greatly incensed and uttering aloud his name, he hurried to his abode. There with all the various supernatural powers he could command he tried to dislodge the Buddha from his seat, but without success even his special weapon, the Duss\u00e1vudha being of no avail against the Buddha. Then, approaching the Buddha, \u00c1lavaka asked him to leave his house, which the Buddha did. He then summoned the Buddha back and he came. Three times this happened and three times the Buddha obeyed, judging compliance to be the best way of softening his wrath, but the fourth time the Buddha refused to return. Thereupon \u00c1lavaka expressed his desire to ask questions of the Buddha, hoping thereby to fatigue him. The Buddha agreed, and when he had answered all the questions to \u00c1lavaka's satisfaction, the latter became a <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')\">Sot\u00e1panna</a> (SnA.i.239).</p><p>At dawn of day, King \u00c1lavaka's men brought the young prince, \u00c1lavaka-Kumara to the Yakkha, as sacrifice.

When they announced to \u00c1lavaka that they had brought their offering, and handed him the child, he was much ashamed because of the Buddha's presence. \u00c1lavaka gave the child to the Buddha, who blessed him and gave him back to the king's messengers. The boy, having passed from the Yakkha's hands to those of the Buddha, and from there to the king's men, thereafter became known as Hatthaka \u00c1lavaka (SnA.i.239-40).</p><p>When the king and the citizens heard that the Yakkha had become a follower of the Buddha, they built for him a special abode near that of Vessavana and provided him with endless gifts of flowers, perfumes, etc., for his use.

It is also given in brief in AA.i.211-12 and with some difference in detail. </p><p>\u00c1lavaka's abode was thirty leagues from S\u00e1vatthi, and the Buddha covered the whole journey in one day (SnA.i.220). The abode was near a banyan tree and on the ground (bhummattham,) well protected with walls, etc., and covered on the top by a metal net, it was like a cart enclosed on all sides. It was three leagues in extent, and over it lay the road to Himav\u00e1 by air (SnA.i.222). Ascetics, having seen the glittering palace, often called to find out what it was. \u00c1lavaka would ask them questions regarding their faith, and when they could not answer he would assume a subtle form and, entering their hearts, would drive them mad (SnA.i.228).</p><p>\u00c1lavaka shouted his name before starting from Himav\u00e1 to vanquish the Buddha. He stood with his left foot on Manosil\u00e1tala and his right on Kel\u00e1sak\u00fata.

It had the power, if it were thrown into the sky, of stopping rain for twelve years and if cast on the earth of destroying all trees and crops for a like period. If hurled into the sea it would dry up all the water, and it could shatter Sineru into pieces.

The origin of the drum is related in the Kakkata J\u00e1taka. When the Golden Crab, there mentioned, was trampled to death by the elephants, his two claws broke away from his body and lay apart in the Kul\u00edradaha, where he lived. During the floods the water flowed from the Ganges into this lake, running back again when the floods subsided. The two claws were thus carried into the Ganges. One of them reached the sea, and the Asuras, picking it up, made thereof the drum named \u00c1lambara. The other was picked up by the Ten Royal Brothers (evidently the Das\u00e1rahas mentioned above) while playing in the river, and they made of it the little drum \u00c1naka (J.ii.344; the J\u00e1taka is quoted in SA.ii.167-8, with several variations in detail).</p><p>In the Samyutta Commentary (ii.167-8) it is said that the drum was like molten wag in colour, because the crab's claw had been dried by wind and sun. The sound of the drum was heard for twelve leagues, and it was, therefore, used only on festive occasions. On hearing it, the people assembled hurriedly, in various conveyances, decked with splendour. It was called \u00c1naka because it brought the people together as if summoning them (mah\u00e1janam pakkositv\u00e1 viya \u00e1net\u00ed ti \u00c1nako). </p><p>Later, when the original drumhead had vanished, it could hardly be heard even inside a hall.</p><p>The \u00c1naka drum is used as a simile in the \u00c1ni Sutta (S.ii.266-7; see also KS.ii.178, n.4).</p><hr><hr>"}, {"data": ["<ul>  <li>  <h2>\u00c1r\u00e1mad\u00fasaka J\u00e1taka </h2>  </li></ul><hr><p><b>1. \u00c1r\u00e1mad\u00fasaka J\u00e1taka (No. 46).</b>-Once in <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')\">Benares</a> there was a festival and all the townsfolk assembled to keep holiday.

The monkey-king agreed and, when the man had gone, distributed the water-skins and water-pots among the monkeys. In order that the water should not be wasted, he gave instructions to the monkeys that they should pull out the trees by the roots and give plenty of water to those plans whose roots went deep and little to those with small roots.

In S.iii.105 \u00c1nanda acknowledges his indebtedness to Punna and gives an account of Punna's sermon to him.</p><p>During the first twenty years after the", "Enlightenment, the Buddha did not have the same personal attendants all the time. From time to time various monks looked after him, among them being <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagasamala_th')\">N\u00e1gasam\u00e1la</a>, <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagita')\">N\u00e1gita</a>, Upav\u00e1na, Sunakkhatta, the novice Cunda, S\u00e1gata, R\u00e1dha and Meghiya. We are told that the Buddha was not particularly pleased with any of them. At the end of twenty years, at an assembly of the monks, the Buddha declared that he was advanced in years and desired to have somebody as his permanent body-servant, one who would respect his wishes in every way. The Buddha says that sometimes his attendants would not obey him, and on certain occasions had dropped his bowl and robe and gone away, leaving him.</p><p>All the great disciples offered their services, but were rejected by the Buddha. \u00c1nanda alone was left; he sat in silence. When asked why he did not offer himself, his reply was that the Buddha knew best whom to choose. When the Buddha signified that he desired to have \u00c1nanda, the latter agreed to accept the post on certain conditions. The Buddha was never to give him any choice food or garment (*) gotten by him, nor appoint for him a separate \"fragrant cell\" (residence), nor include him in the invitations accepted by the Buddha. For, he said, if the Buddha did any of these things, some would say that \u00c1nanda's services to the Buddha were done in order to get clothes, good fare and lodging and be included in the invitations. Further he was to be allowed to accept invitations on behalf of the Buddha; to bring to the Buddha those who came to see him from afar; to place before the Buddha all his perplexities, and the Buddha was to repeat to him any doctrine taught in his absence. If these concessions were not granted, he said, some would ask where was the advantage of such service. Only if these privileges were", "allowed him would people trust him and realise that the Buddha had real regard for him. The Buddha agreed to the conditions.</p><p> </p><blockquote>  <p>(*) \u00c1nanda did, however, accept one of   the two robes given by Pukkusa the Mallan to the Buddha (D.ii.133);   Buddhaghosa explains this by saying that \u00c1nanda's period of service had now   come to an end, and also he wished to be free from the accusation that even   after having served the Buddha for twenty-five years, the Buddha had never   made him any gift. It is further stated that \u00c1nanda offered the robe to the   Buddha later (DA.ii.570).</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>Thenceforth, for twenty-five years (Thag.v.1039), \u00c1nanda waited upon the Buddha, following him like a shadow, bringing him water and toothpick, washing his feet, accompanying him everywhere, sweeping his cell and so forth. By day he was always at hand, forestalling the Master's slightest wish; at night, stout staff and large torch in hand, he would go nine times round the Buddha's Gandha-kuti in order to keep awake, in case he were needed, and also to prevent the Buddha's sleep from being disturbed. </p><p>The account here given is summarised from AA.i.159ff. and from ThagA.ii.121ff. On the boons see J.iv.96, where \u00c1nanda had asked for boons in the past too. The Tibetan sources give a different and interesting version of \u00c1nanda's entry into the Order. See Rockhill: Life of the Buddha, 57-8.</p><p>Many examples are given of- \u00c1nanda's solicitude for the Buddha, particularly during the Buddha's last days, as related in the Mah\u00e1 Parinibb\u00e1na Sutta. \u00c1nanda was the Buddha's equal in age (having been born on the same day), and it is touching to read of this old and most devoted attendant ministering to his eminent cousin, fetching him water, bathing him, rubbing his body, preparing his bed, and receiving last", "instructions from him on various matters of importance. It is said that when the Buddha was ill, \u00c1nanda became sympathetically sick (D.ii.99). He was aware of every change that occurred in the Buddha's body. E.g., the brightening of his features after Janavasabha's visit (D.ii.204); and the fading of his complexion just before death, which was apparent when the Buddha put on the robe given by Pukkusa (ibid., 133).</p><p> </p><p>Once, when acting on the instructions of Devadatta, the royal mahouts let loose N\u00e1l\u00e1giri, maddened with drink, on the Buddha's path, so that he might trample the Buddha to death, \u00c1nanda, seeing the animal rushing towards them, immediately took his stand in front of the Buddha. Three times the Buddha forbade him to do so, but \u00c1nanda, usually most obedient, refused to move, and it is said that the Buddha, by his iddhi-power, made the earth roll back in order to get \u00c1nanda out of the elephant's path. [J.v.335-6; it was in this connection that the C\u00falahamsa J\u00e1taka was preached to show that \u00c1nanda had, in previous births also, renounced his life to save that of the Buddha; see also DhA.i.119. The Cullavagga account of the N\u00e1l\u00e1giri incident makes no mention of \u00c1nanda's past (Vin.ii.195)]. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, the extreme zealousness of \u00c1nanda drew on him the Buddha's rebuke - e.g., when he prepared tekatuka gruel (gruel with three kinds of pungent substances) for the Buddha when he was suffering from wind in the stomach. The gruel was prepared from food kept indoors and was cooked by \u00c1nanda himself, indoors; this was against the rules (Vin.i.210-11), but \u00c1nanda knew that the gruel would cure the Buddha.</p><p> </p><p>\u00c1nanda was most efficient in the performance of the numerous duties attached to his post. Whenever the Buddha wished to summon the monks or to send a message to anyone, it was to \u00c1nanda that", "he entrusted the task. See, e.g., D.ii.199; 147; Vin.i.80; M.i.456.</p><p>He reported to the Buddha any news which he beard and thought interesting. E.g., the death of Nigantha N\u00e1taputta, of which he learnt from Cunda Samanuddesa (D.iii.118; M.ii.244); also Devadatta's conspiracy to harm the Buddha (Vin.ii.198).  </p><p>Laymen and laywomen, wishing to give alms to the Buddha and the monks, would often consult him in their difficulties, and he would always advise them. E.g., the Andhakavinda Br\u00e1hmana (Vin.i.220-1); Roja the Malla (ibid., 248); see also ibid., 238f.</p><p>When the monks came to him expressing their desire to hear the Buddha preach, he did his best to grant their wish. E.g\u201e when the Buddha retired into the P\u00e1rileyya forest (S.iii.95; DhA.i.50f.).</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes when \u00c1nanda felt that an interview with the Buddha would be of use to certain people, he would contrive that the Buddha should talk to them and solve their doubts; thus, for instance, he arranged an interview for the Nigantha Saccaka (M.i.237) and the brahmins Sang\u00e1rava and Rammaka (S.i.163; M.i.161). Similarly he took Samiddhi to the Buddha when he found that Samiddhi had wrongly represented the Buddha's views (M.iii.208). When he discovered that Kimbila and a large number of other monks would greatly benefit if the Buddha would preach to them on \u00e1n\u00e1p\u00e1nasati, he requested the Buddha that he should do so. (S.v.323). \u00c1nanda's requests were, however, not always granted. Once, for instance, though he asked the Buddha three times to recite the P\u00e1timokkha, the Buddha refused to do so until an offending monk had been removed (Vin.ii.236f.).</p><p>Again, when at Ves\u00e1li, as a result of the Buddha's talks to the monks on asubha, a large number of them, feeling shame and loathing for their bodies, committed suicide, \u00c1nanda suggested to the Buddha", "that he might teach the monks some method by which they might obtain insight (a\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1) (S.v.320f).</p><p> </p><p>In order that people might still worship the Buddha when he was away on tour, \u00c1nanda planted the \u00c1nanda-Bodhi (q.v.).</p><p>\u00c1nanda was, however, careful that people should not weary the Buddha unnecessarily. Even when he told the Buddha about the suicide of the monks (mentioned above), he was careful to wait till the Buddha had finished his fortnight's solitude, because he had given orders that he should not be disturbed.</p><p> </p><p>When Subhadda wanted to see the Buddha as he lay on his death-bed, \u00c1nanda refused to let him in until expressly asked to do so by the Master (D.ii.149). That same day when the Mallas of Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1 came with their families to pay their last respects to the Buddha, \u00c1nanda arranged them in groups, and introduced each group so that the ceremony might be gone through without delay (D.ii.148).</p><p> </p><p>He often saved the Buddha from unpleasantness by preventing too pious admirers from trying to persuade the Buddha to do what was against his scruples. E.g., Bodhir\u00e1jakum\u00e1ra, when he asked the Buddha to walk over the carpets in his mansion, Kokanada (Vin.ii.128; M.ii.94).</p><p> </p><p>Among \u00c1nanda's duties was the task of going round to put away anything which might have been forgotten by anyone in the congregation after hearing the Buddha preach (DhA.i.410).</p><p> </p><p>\u00c1nanda was often consulted by colleagues on their various difficulties. Thus we find Vang\u00edsa (S.i.188; Thag.vers.1223-6) confiding to him his restlessness at the sight of women and asking for his advice. Among others who came to him with questions on various doctrinal matters were K\u00e1mabh\u00fa (S.iv.165-6), Ud\u00e1yi (S.v.166-8; A.iv.449), Channa (S.iii.133-4),", "and Bhadda (S.v.171-3; ThagA.i.474; he could not, however, be of use to his fellow celibate Bhandu). Nor were these consultations confined to his fellow-monks, for we find the brahmins Ghosita (S.iv.113) and Unn\u00e1bha (S.v.272), the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakum\u00e1raka (A.i.220), the paribb\u00e1jakas Channa (A.i.215) and Kokanuda (A.v.196), the up\u00e1sik\u00e1 Migas\u00e1l\u00e1 (A.iii.347, and again A.v.137), a householder of Kosamb\u00ed (A.i.217) and Pasenadi Kosala (M.ii.112), all coming to him for enlightenment and instruction. It was on this occasion that Pasenadi presented \u00c1nanda with a valuable piece of foreign material which had been sent to him by Aj\u00e1tasattu. </p><p>Sometimes the monks, having heard a brief sermon from the Buddha, would seek out \u00c1nanda to obtain from him a more detailed exposition, for he had the reputation of being able to expound the Dhamma (A.v.225; S.iv.93).</p><p> </p><p>It is said that the Buddha would often deliberately shorten his discourse to the monks so that they might be tempted to have it further explained by \u00c1nanda. They would then return to the Buddha and report to him \u00c1nanda's exposition, which would give him an opportunity of praising \u00c1nanda's erudition. MA.i.81; for such praise see, e.g., A.v.229. It is said that once when a certain landowner asked the Buddha how he could show honour to the Dhamma, the Buddha told him to show honour to \u00c1nanda if he wished to honour the Dhamma (J.iv.369). </p><p> </p><p>In the Sekha Sutta (M.i.353ff ) we are told that after the Buddha had preached to the S\u00e1kiyans of Kapilavatthu till late at night, he asked \u00c1nanda to continue the discourse while he himself rested. \u00c1nanda did so, and when the Buddha awoke after his sleep, he commended \u00c1nanda on his ability. On another occasion, the Buddha asks \u00c1nanda to address the monks on the wonders attendant on a Buddha's birth, and the Acchari-yabbhuta-Dhamma Sutta", "is the result. The Buddha is mentioned as listening with approval (M.iii.119ff).</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes \u00c1nanda would suggest to the Buddha a simile to be used in his discourse, e.g. the Dhammay\u00e1na simile (S.v.5); or by a simile suggest a name to be given to a discourse, e.g. the Madhupindika Sutta (M.i.114; cp. Upav\u00e1na suggesting the name for the P\u00e1s\u00e1dika Sutta D.iii.141); or again, particularly wishing to remember a certain Sutta, he would ask the Buddha to give it a name, e.g. the Bahudh\u00e1tuka Sutta (M.iii.67).</p><p> </p><p>Several instances occur of \u00c1nanda preaching to the monks of his own accord (E.g., A.ii.156f.; v.6) and also to the laity (E.g., A.ii.194). The Sandaka Sutta records a visit paid by \u00c1nanda with his followers to the paribbajaka Sandaka, and describes how he won Sandaka over by a discourse. Sometimes, as in the case of the Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.189f ) \u00c1nanda would repeat to the assembly of monks a sermon which he had previously heard the Buddha preach. \u00c1nanda took the fullest advantage of the permission granted to him by the Buddha of asking him any question he desired. He had a very inquiring mind; if the Buddha smiled he would ask the reason (M.ii.45, 50, 74; A.iii.214f.; J.iii.405; iv.7).</p><p>Or if he remained silent, \u00c1nanda had to be told the reason (S.iv.400). He knew that the Buddha did nothing without definite cause; when Upav\u00e1na, who stood fanning the Buddha, was asked to move away, \u00c1nanda wished to know the reason, and was told that Upav\u00e1na prevented various spirits from seeing the Buddha (D.ii.139). The Buddha was always willing to answer \u00c1nanda's questions to his satisfaction. Sometimes, as in the case of his question regarding the dead citizens of \u00d1\u00e1tik\u00e1 (D.ii.91ff.),* a long discourse would result.**</p><blockquote>  <p>* In this case the discourse concluded", "with a description of the Dhamm\u00e1d\u00e1sa (Mirror of Truth) to be used for all   time; see also S.v.356-60.</p>  <p>** The Pabbajj\u00e1 Sutta (Sn.72ff.), was   preached because of \u00c1nanda's request that the Buddha should give an account of   his renunciation (SnA.ii.381); see also Pubbayog\u00e1vacara Sutta (SnA.i.47).</p></blockquote><p>Most often his consultations with the Buddha were on matters of doctrine or were connected with it - e.g., on nirodha (S.iii.24); loka (S.iv.53); su\u00f1\u00f1a (S.iv.54; M.iii.104-24); vedan\u00e1 (S.iv.219-21) ; iddhi (S.v.282-4; 286); \u00e1n\u00e1p\u00e1nasati (S.v.328-34); bhava, etc. (A.i.223f.); on the chalabhij\u00e1ti of P\u00farana Kassapa (q.v.); the aims and purposes of s\u00edla (A.v.1f., repeated in v.311f.); the possibilities of sam\u00e1dhi (A.v.7f., repeated in v.318 and in A.i.132f.); on sanghabheda (A.v.75ff.); the qualities requisite to be a counsellor of monks (A.iv.279ff.); the power of carrying possessed by a Buddha's voice (A.i.226f.); the conditions necessary for a monk's happiness (A.iii.132f.); the different ways of mastering the elements (M.iii.62f.); the birthplace of \"noble men\" (DhA.iii.248); and the manner in which previous Buddhas kept the Fast-day (DhA.iii.246). To these should be added the conversations on numerous topics recorded in the Mah\u00e1parinibb\u00e1na Sutta. Some of these questions - e.g., about earthquakes (D.ii.107ff.; A.iv.312ff.) and the different kinds of spirits present at the death of the Buddha (D.ii.139f.) - seem to have been put into \u00c1nanda's mouth in order that they might be used as pegs on which to hang beliefs connected with them which were current among later-day Buddhists.</p><p> </p><p>Not all the Suttas addressed to \u00c1nanda are, however, the result of his questions. Sometimes he would repeat to the Buddha conversations he had had with others and talks he had overheard, and the", "Buddha would expound in detail the topics occurring therein.</p><p> </p><p>Thus, for instance, a conversation with Pasenadi Kosala on Kaly\u00e1namittat\u00e1 is repeated and the Buddha explains its importance (S.i.87-9; v.2-3) ; \u00c1nanda tells the Buddha about his visit to the Paribbajak\u00e1r\u00e1ma in Kosambi and what he there heard about a bhikkhu being called niddasa after twelve years of celibacy. The Buddha thereupon expounds the seven niddasavatthu (A.iv.37ff.). The account conveyed by \u00c1nanda of Ud\u00e1y\u00ed preaching to a large crowd leads to an exposition of the difficulties of addressing large assemblies and the qualities needed to please them (A.iii.184). A conversation between Ud\u00e1y\u00ed and the carpenter Pa\u00f1cakanga on feelings is overheard by \u00c1nanda and reported to the Buddha, who gives a detailed explanation of his views on the subject (S.iv.222f.; M.i.397f.). The same thing happens when \u00c1nanda mentions to the Buddha talks he had heard between S\u00e1riputta and the P\u00e1ribb\u00e1jakas (S.ii.35-7) and between the same Elder and Bh\u00famiya (S.ii.39-41). Sometimes - as in the case of the up\u00e1sik\u00e1 Migas\u00e1l\u00e1 (A.iii.347; v.137) - \u00c1nanda would answer questions put to him as best he could, and seek the Buddha's advice and corrections of his interpretation of the Doctrine.</p><p> </p><p>When the monks asked \u00c1nanda whether the Buddha's predictions regarding the results of Devadatta's crimes were based on actual knowledge, he furnished them with no answer at all until he had consulted the Buddha (A.iii.402). Similarly, when Tapussa questions him as to why household life is not attractive to laymen, \u00c1nanda takes him straight away to the Buddha, who is spending his siesta in the Mah\u00e1vana in Uruvelakappa (A.iv.438f.). Once \u00c1nanda fancies that he knows all about causation, and tells the Buddha how glad he is that he should understand this difficult subject. The", "Buddha points out to him that he really knows very little about it and preaches to him the Mah\u00e1nid\u00e1na Sutta (D.ii.55ff.; S.ii.92-3).</p><p>When \u00c1nanda realises that the Buddha will die in a short while, with childlike simplicity, he requests the Buddha to make a last pronouncement regarding the Order (D.ii<st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID=\".98 ff\">.98 ff</st2:frenchfranctoeuro>.; S.v.152-4).</p><p> </p><p>On several occasions it is news that \u00c1nanda brings to the Buddha - e.g., about the death of the Nigantha N\u00e1taputta, and about Devadatta's plots, already mentioned - which provoke the Buddha to preach to him: Phagguna has died, and at his death his senses seemed very clear; so they would, says the Buddha, and proceeds to speak of the advantages of listening to the Dhamma in due season (A.iii.381f.). Or again, Girim\u00e1nanda is ill and would the Buddha go and see him? The Buddha suggests that \u00c1nanda should go and tell Girim\u00e1nanda about the ten kinds of sa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1 (aniccas\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1, etc.), and the patient will recover (A.v.108f.). \u00c1nanda desires to retire into solitude and develop zeal and energy; would the Buddha tell him on which topics to meditate? And the Buddha preaches to him the doctrine of impermanence (S.iii.187; iv.54-5).</p><p> </p><p>The Buddha, however, often preached to \u00c1nanda without any such provocation on various topics - e.g., on the nature of the sahkh\u00e1ra (S.iii.3740); on the impossibility of the monk without faith attaining eminence in the s\u00e1sana (A.v.152ff.); on the power the Buddha has of knowing which doctrines would appeal to different people and of preaching accordingly (A.v.36f.); on immorality and its consequences (A.i.50f.); on the admonitions that should be addressed to new entrants to the Order (A.iii.138f.); on the advice which should be given to friends by those desiring their welfare", "(A.i.222).</p><p> </p><p>The various topics on which the Buddha discoursed to \u00c1nanda as recorded in the Mah\u00e1 Parinibb\u00e1na Sutta, have already been referred to. Some of them - e.g., on the eight assemblies, the eight positions of mastery, the eight stages of deliverance (D.ii.112) - seem to be stereotyped later additions. On the other hand, with regard to the accounts of the honours to be paid to a Buddha's dead body, the places of pilgrimage for the pious, and various other similar subjects, it is impossible to say how far they are authentic. In a few instances the remarks addressed to \u00c1nanda seem to be meant for others, to be heard by them or to be conveyed to them - e.g., in the dispute between Ud\u00e1y\u00ed and S\u00e1riputta, when they both seek the Buddha for him to settle the differences in opinion between them (A.iii.192ff.); or, again, when the recalcitrant Ud\u00e1y\u00ed fails to answer the Buddha's question on subjects of reflection (anussatitth\u00e1na), and \u00c1nanda gives an answer which the Buddha approves (A.iii.322ff.). A question asked by \u00c1nanda as to whether there are any scents which spread even against the wind, results in the well-known sermon about the fame of the holy man being wafted everywhere (A.i.222f.; DhA.i.420ff.). Once or twice \u00c1nanda intervenes in a discussion between the Buddha and another, either to ask a question or to suggest a simile which he feels could help the Buddha in establishing his point - e.g., in the interviews of Uttiya Paribb\u00e1jaka (A.v.194), of the brahmin Sang\u00e1rava (A.i.169), and again of Vid\u00fadabha, son of Pasenadi (M.ii.130).</p><p> </p><p>In the Mah\u00e1 M\u00e1lunky\u00e1 Sutta (M.i.433), it is \u00c1nanda's intervention which evokes the discourse on the Five Fetters. Similarly he intervenes in a discussion between the Buddha and P\u00e1r\u00e1sariya's pupil, Uttara, and persuades the Buddha to preach the Indriyabh\u00e1van\u00e1 Sutta on", "the cultivation of the Faculties (M.iii.298ff.).</p><p>Buddhaghosa gives a list of the discourses which bring out the eminence and skill of \u00c1nanda; they are the Sekha, B\u00e1hitiya, \u00c1na\u00f1jasapp\u00e1ya, Gopaka-Moggall\u00e1na, Bahudh\u00e1tuka, C\u00falasu\u00f1\u00f1ata, Mah\u00e1su\u00f1\u00f1ata, Acchariyabbhuta, Bhaddekaratta, Mah\u00e1nid\u00e1-na, Mah\u00e1parinibb\u00e1na, Subha and C\u00falaniyalokadh\u00e1tu. (For particulars of these see under the respective names.) The books give accounts of several conversations between \u00c1nanda and his eminent colleagues, such as S\u00e1riputta. See also his conversation with Mus\u00edla, and Savittha and N\u00e1rada at Kosamb\u00ed in the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma (S.ii.113f.). He seems to have felt happy in their company and did not hesitate to take to them his difficulties; thus we find him asking S\u00e1riputta why only certain beings in this world reach parinibb\u00e1na (A.ii.167); on another occasion he asks S\u00e1riputta about the possibilities of sam\u00e1dhi (A.v.8). On the other hand, at least twice (A.iii.201f.; 361f.), when \u00c1nanda asks his questions of S\u00e1riputta, the latter suggests that \u00c1nanda himself should find the answer, and having heard it, S\u00e1riputta praises him highly and extols his abilities.</p><p> </p><p>\u00c1nanda's special friends seem to have been S\u00e1riputta, Moggall\u00e1na, Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, Anuruddha and Kankh\u00e1 Revata (E.g., M.i.212f). He was the Sangha-navaka among them all, yet they held him in high esteem (MA.i.436). \u00c1nanda and S\u00e1riputta were very special friends. It is said that S\u00e1riputta loved \u00c1nanda because the latter did for the Buddha what S\u00e1riputta would wish to have done himself, and \u00c1nanda respected S\u00e1riputta because he was the Buddha's chief disciple. Young men who were ordained by either of them would be sent to the other to learn under him. They shared between them any good thing given to them. Once \u00c1nanda was presented by a brahmin with a costly robe; immediately he wished to give it to S\u00e1riputta, but as the latter was away at the", "time, he obtained the Buddha's permission to keep it for him till his return (Vin.i.289; Sp.iii.636-7; MA.i.436).</p><p>The Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya (i.63-4) contains an eulogy on S\u00e1riputta by \u00c1nanda, where the latter speaks of his comprehensive and manifold wisdom, joyous and swift, of his rampant energy and readiness to accept advice. When he hears of S\u00e1riputta's death from Cunda the Samanuddesa, he goes to the Buddha with Cunda (not wishing to break the news himself) and they take with them S\u00e1riputta's bowl and outer robe, Cunda carrying the ashes, and there \u00c1nanda confesses to the Buddha that when he heard the news he felt as thought his body were drugged, his senses confused and his mind become a blank (S.v.161; Thag.vers.1034-5). The Commentary adds (SA.i.180) that \u00c1nanda was trembling \"like a cock escaping from the mouth of a cat.\"</p><p>That Mah\u00e1 Kassapa was fond of \u00c1nanda, we may gather from the fact that it was he who contrived to have him elected on the First Council, and when Mah\u00e1 Kassapa heard of \u00c1nanda's attainment of arahantship, it was he who led the applause (DA.i.11). \u00c1nanda held him in the highest veneration, and on one occasion refused to take part in an upasampad\u00e1 ordination because he would have to pronounce Kassapa's name and did not consider this respectful towards the Elder (Vin.i.92). In their conversations, Kassapa addresses \u00c1nanda as \"\u00e1vuso\", \u00c1nanda addresses Kassapa as \"bhante.\" There is an interview recorded between them in which Kassapa roundly abuses \u00c1nanda, calling him- corn-trampler\" and \"despoiler of families,\" and he ends by up saying , this boy does not know his own measure.\" \u00c1nanda had been touring Dahkhinagiri with a large company of monks, mostly youths, and the latter had not brought much credit upon them selves. When Kassapa sees \u00c1nanda on his return", "to R\u00e1jagaha, he puts on him the whole blame for the youths' want of training. \u00c1nanda winces at being called \"boy\"; , my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence, yet I am not vexed that you should call me 'boy' even at this time of day.\" Thullanand\u00e1 heard of this incident and showed great annoyance. \"How dare Mah\u00e1 Kassapa,\" she says, \"who was once a heretical teacher, chide the sage \u00c1nanda, calling him 'boy'?\" Mah\u00e1 Kassapa complains to \u00c1nanda of Thullanand\u00e1's behaviour; probably, though we are not told so, \u00c1nanda apologised to him on her behalf (S.ii.217ff).</p><p> </p><p>On another occasion, \u00c1nanda, after a great deal of persuasion, took Kassapa to a settlement of the nuns. There Kassapa preached to them, but the nun Thullatiss\u00e1 was not pleased and gave vent publicly to her displeasure. \"How does Kassapa think it fit to preach the doctrine in the presence of the learned sage \u00c1nanda? It is as if the needle-pedlar were to deem he could sell a needle to the needle-maker.\" Kassapa is incensed at these words, but \u00c1nanda appeases him by acknowledging that he (Kassapa) is in every way his superior and asks him to pardon Tissa. \"Be indulgent, your reverence,\" says he, \"women are foolish.\" S.ii.215ff.; the Tibetans say that when Kassapa died, Aj\u00e1tasattu was very grieved because he had not been able to see the monk's body. \u00c1nanda took the king to the mountain where it had been buried and showed it to him (Rockhill, op. cit., p.162 and n.2).</p><p>In this passage \u00c1nanda is spoken of as Vedehamuni. The Commentary (SA.ii.132) explains it by panditamuni, and says further, pandito hi \u00f1\u00e1nasankh\u00e1tena vedena \u00edhati sabbakicc\u00e1ni karoti, tasm\u00e1 vedeho ti vuccati ; vedeho ca so muni c\u00e1 ti vedehamuni. Compare with this the derivation of Vedehiputta in connection with Aj\u00e1tasattu. See also Vedehik\u00e1. The", "Mtu. (iii.176-7) says that when the Buddha went away from home \u00c1nanda wished to join him, but his mother was unwilling, because his brother, Devadatta, had already gone away. \u00c1nanda therefore went to the Videha country and became a muni. Is this another explanation of the term Vedehamuni?</p><p> </p><p>It was perhaps \u00c1nanda's championship of the women's cause which made him popular with the nuns and earned for him a reputation rivalling, as was mentioned above, even that of Mah\u00e1 Kassapa. When Paj\u00e1pat\u00ed Gotam\u00ed, with a number of S\u00e1kyan women, undaunted by the Buddha's refusal of their request at Kapilavatthu, followed him into Ves\u00e1li and there beseeched his consent for women to enter the Order, the Buddha would not change his mind.</p><p>\u00c1nanda found the women dejected and weeping, with swollen feet, standing outside the K\u00fat\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1. Having learnt what had happened, he asked the Buddha to grant their request. Three times he asked and three times the Buddha refused. Then he changed his tactics. He inquired of the Buddha if women were at all capable of attaining the Fruits of the Path. The answer was in the affirmative, and \u00c1nanda pushed home the advantage thus gained. In the end the Buddha allowed women to enter the Order subject to certain conditions. They expressed their great gratitude to \u00c1nanda (Vin.ii.253ff. \u00c1nanda is again found as intermediary for Paj\u00e1pat\u00ed Gotam\u00ed in M.iii.253f). In this connection, the Buddha is reported as having said (Vin.ii.256) that had \u00c1nanda not persuaded him to give his consent to the admission of women to the Order, the S\u00e1sana would have lasted a thousand years, but now it would last only five hundred.</p><p>This championing of the women's cause was also one of the charges brought against \u00c1nanda by his colleagues at the end of the First Council. (See below.)</p>", "<p>Perhaps it was this solicitude for their privileges that prompted him to ask the Buddha one day why it was that women did not sit in public assemblies (e.g. courts of justice), or embark on business, or reap the full fruit of their actions (A.ii.82. See also GS.ii.92, n.2, on the interpretation of the last word).</p><p>That \u00c1nanda was in the habit of preaching frequently to the nuns is evident from the incidents quoted above and also from other passages (E.g., S.v.154ff.; Thag.v.1020; ThagA.ii.129). He seems also to have been in charge of the arrangements for sending preachers regularly to the nuns. A passage in the Samyutta Commentary (i.210) seems to indicate that \u00c1nanda was a popular preacher among laywomen as well.</p><p>They would stand round him when he preached, fanning him and asking him questions on the Dhamma. When he went to Kosamb\u00ed to impose the higher penalty on Channa, the women of King Udena's harem, hearing of his presence in the park, came to him and listened to his preaching. So impressed were they that they gave him five hundred robes (Vin.ii.290). It was on this occasion that \u00c1nanda convinced Udena of the conscientiousness with which the S\u00e1kyaputta monks used everything which was given to them, wasting nothing. The king, pleased with \u00c1nanda, gave him another five hundred robes, all of which he distributed among the community. </p><p>Ananda had been a tailor in a past birth and had given a Pacceka Buddha a piece of cloth, the size of his hand, and a needle. Because of the gift of the needle he was wise, because of the cloth he got 500 robes (AA.i.239).</p><p>A similar story is related of the women of Pasenadi's palace and their gift to \u00c1nanda. The king was at first angry, but afterwards gave \u00c1nanda one thousand robes (J.ii.24ff).</p><p> </p><p>The Dhammapada Commentary (i.382ff )", "says that once Pasenadi asked the Buddha to go regularly to the palace with five hundred monks and preach the Law to his queens Mallik\u00e1 and V\u00e1sabhakhattiy\u00e1 and to the other women in the palace. When the Buddha said that it was impossible for him to go regularly to one place he was asked to send a monk, and the duty was assigned to \u00c1nanda. He therefore went to the palace at stated times and instructed the queens. Mallik\u00e1 was found to be a good student, but not so V\u00e1sabhakhattiy\u00e1.</p><p> </p><p>The J\u00e1taka Commentary (i.382) says that the women of the palace were themselves asked which of the eighty chief disciples they would have as their preacher and they unanimously chose \u00c1nanda. For an incident connected with \u00c1nanda's visits to the palace see the Mah\u00e1s\u00e1ra J\u00e1taka and also Pasenadi.</p><p>According to the Anguttara Commentary (ii.533) \u00c1nanda was beautiful to look at.</p><p>\u00c1nanda's services seem often to have been sought for consoling the sick. Thus we find An\u00e1thapindika sending for him when he lay ill (M.iii.258), and also Sirivaddha (S.v.176f) and M\u00e1nadinna (S.v.177f). He is elsewhere mentioned as helping the Buddha to wait on a sick monk (Vin.i.302). We are told that when the Buddha had his afternoon siesta, \u00c1nanda would spend his time in waiting upon the sick and talking to them (Sp.iii.651). \u00c1nanda was never too busy to show gratitude to his friends. When a certain crow-keeper's family, members of which had been of special service to him, had been destroyed by a pestilence, leaving only two very young boys, he obtained the Buddha's special permission to ordain them and look after them, though they were under the requisite age. (Vin.i.79; to a young monk who used to wait on him and do various services for him, \u00c1nanda gave five hundred robes presented to him by Pasenadi; the monk distributed them to his colleagues).</p>", "<p>When \u00c1nanda discovered that his friend Roja and Malla had no real faith in the Buddha, he was greatly grieved and interceded on his special behalf with the Buddha that he should make Roja a believer. Later he obtained the Buddha's permission for Roja to offer a meal of potherbs (Vin.i.247-9). In another place we find Roja presenting \u00c1nanda with a linen cloth (Vin.i.296). According to the J\u00e1takatthakath\u00e1 (ii.231) Roja once tried to persuade \u00c1nanda to go back to the lay-life.</p><p>His sympathy is also shown in the story of the woman who asked to have a share in the Vih\u00e1ra built by Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1. She brought a costly carpet, but could find no place in which to put it; it looked so poor beside the other furnishings. \u00c1nanda helped her in her disappointment (DhA.i.415f).</p><p>Once in Jetavana, in an assembly of monks, the Buddha spoke the praises of \u00c1nanda, and ranked him the foremost bhikkhu in five respects: erudition, good behaviour (gatimant\u00e1nam, power of walking, according to Dhammap\u00e1la), retentive memory, resoluteness and personal attention (A.i.24f). Again, shortly before the Buddha's death, he speaks affectionately of \u00c1nanda (D.ii.144-5; A.ii.132; A.v.229; SA.ii.94f ); \u00c1nanda knew the right time to bring visitors to the Tath\u00e1gata; he had four exceptional qualities, in that whoever came to see him, monks or nuns, laymen or laywomen, they were all filled with joy on beholding him; when he preached to them they listened with rapture and delight, which never tired. He was called \u00c1nanda because he brought joy to his kinsmen (ThagA.ii.123).</p><p>But see the story of Atula (DhA.iii.327), who is not satisfied with \u00c1nanda's preaching.</p><p>Another proof of the Buddha's esteem for \u00c1nanda is the incident of his asking \u00c1nanda to design a robe for the monks to be in pattern like a field in Magadha (Vin.i.287).</p>", "<p> </p><p>In spite of \u00c1nanda having been the constant companion of the Buddha - probably because of that very fact - it was not until after the Buddha's parinibb\u00e1na that \u00c1nanda was able to realise Arahantship. Buddhaghosa gives a long account of \u00c1nanda's struggle for final emancipation (DA.i.9ff.); see also Vin.ii.286. Though he was not an arahant he had the patisambhid\u00e1, being among the few who possessed this qualification while yet learners (Sekh\u00e1) ( VibhA.388). When it was decided by Mah\u00e1 Kassapa and others that a Convocation should be held to systematise the Buddha's teachings, five hundred monks were chosen as delegates, among them, \u00c1nanda. He was, however, the only non-arahant (sekha) among them, and he had been enjoined by his colleagues to put forth great effort and repair this disqualification. At length, when the convocation assembled, a vacant seat had to be left for him. It had not been until late the previous night that, after a final supreme effort, he had attained the goal. He had been occupied in consoling the laity after the Buddha's death and had had no time for practising meditation. In the end it was a devat\u00e1 in the woodland grove in Kosala, where he was staying, who pointed out the urgency of the matter (S.i.199-200); but see ThagA.i.237, where the credit for this is given to a Vajjiputta thera.</p><p>It is said that he won sixfold abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1 when he was just lying down to sleep, his head hardly on the pillow, his feet hardly off the ground. He is therefore described as having become an arahant in none of the four postures. When he appeared in the convocation, Mah\u00e1 Kassapa welcomed him warmly and shouted three times for joy. According to the Majjhimabh\u00e1nak\u00e1, says Buddhaghosa, \u00c1nanda appeared on his seat while the others looked on, having come through the earth; according to others he came through", "the air. According to ThagA.ii.130, it was a Brahm\u00e1 of the Suddh\u00e1v\u00e1sa who announced \u00c1nanda's attainment of arahantship to his colleagues at the Convocation. </p><p>In the convocation, \u00c1nanda was appointed to answer Mah\u00e1 Kassapa's questions, and to co-operate with him in rehearsing the Dhamma (as opposed to the Vinaya).</p><p>\u00c1nanda came to be known as Dhammabhand\u00e1g\u00e1rika, owing to his skill in remembering the word of the Buddha; it is said that he could remember everything spoken by the Buddha, from one to sixty thousand words in the right order; and without missing one single syllable (ThagA.ii.134).</p><p>In the first four Nik\u00e1yas of the Sutta Pitaka, every sutta begins with the words \"Thus have I heard,\" the \"I\" referring to \u00c1nanda. It is not stated that \u00c1nanda was present at the preaching by the Buddha of every sutta, though he was present at most; others, the Buddha repeated to him afterwards, in accordance with the conditions under which he had become the Buddha's attendant.</p><p>We are told that \u00c1nanda had learnt eighty-two thousand dhamma (topics) from the Buddha himself and two thousand from his colleagues (Thag.v.1024). He had also a reputation for fast talking; where an ordinary man could speak one word \u00c1nanda could speak eight; the Buddha could speak sixteen words for each one word of \u00c1nanda (MA.i.283). \u00c1nanda could remember anything he had once heard up to fifteen thousand stanzas of sixty thousand lines (MA.i.501).</p><p>\u00c1nanda lived to be very old (one hundred and twenty years, says DhA.ii.99; he is bracketed with Bakkula, as having lived to a great age, AA.ii.596); a hymn of praise sung at his death is included at the end of the stanzas attributed to him in the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 (Vers.1047-9). That the Buddha's death was a great blow to him is shown by the stanzas he uttered", "immediately after the event (D.ii.157). Three months earlier he had heard for the first time that death of the Buddha was near at hand and had besought him to live longer. The reply attributed to the Buddha is a curious one, namely, that on several previous occasions, at R\u00e1jagaha and at Ves\u00e1l\u00ed (See, e.g., D.102f), he had mentioned to \u00c1nanda that he could, if he so desired, live for a whole kappa, and had hinted that \u00c1nanda should, if he felt so inclined, request him to prolong his life. \u00c1nanda, however, having failed to take the hint on these occasions, the opportunity was now past, and the Buddha must die; the fault was entirely \u00c1nanda's (Ibid., 114-18). It was when \u00c1nanda was temporarily absent from the Buddha's side that the Buddha had assured M\u00e1ra that he would die in three months (Ibid., 105-6).</p><p>As the end approached, the Buddha noticed that \u00c1nanda was not by his side; on enquiry he learnt that \u00c1nanda was outside, weeping and filled with despair at the thought that the Master would soon be no more, and that he (\u00c1nanda) would have to work out his perfection unaided. The Buddha sent for him and consoled him by pointing out that whatever is born must, by its very nature, be dissolved. Three times he said, \"For a long time, \u00c1nanda, you have been very near to me by acts of love, kind and good, never varying, beyond all measure,\" and he exhorted him to be earnest in effort, for he would soon realise emancipation. (Ibid., 144). It was on this occasion that the Pal\u00e1sa J\u00e1taka was preached (J.iii.23ff.).</p><p>Once, earlier, when Ud\u00e1yi had teased \u00c1nanda for not having benefited from his close association with the personality of the Master, the Buddha had defended \u00c1nanda, saying, \"Say not so, Ud\u00e1yi; should he die without attaining perfect freedom from passion, by virtue of his piety, he would seven times win rule over the devas and seven times be King of", "Jambud\u00edpa. Howbeit, in this very life shall \u00c1nanda attain to Nibb\u00e1na. A.i.228.</p><p> </p><p>\u00c1nanda did his best to persuade the Buddha to die in one of the great cities, such as R\u00e1jagaha or S\u00e1vatthi, and not in Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1, the little wattle-and-daub town (as he called it) in the middle of the jungle. He was not satisfied until the Buddha had revealed to him the past history of Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1, how it had once been Kus\u00e1vat\u00ed, the royal capital of the mighty Mah\u00e1 Sudassana (D.ii.146).</p><p>Just before the Buddha died, \u00c1nanda was commissioned to inform the Mallas of the impending event, and after the Buddha's death, Anuruddha entrusted him, with the help of the Mallas of Kusin\u00e1\u00e1a, with all the arrangements for the funeral (D.ii.158ff). \u00c1nanda had earlier (D.ii.141f) learnt from the Buddha how the remains of a Tath\u00e1gata should be treated, and now he was to benefit by the instruction.</p><p>At the end of the First Council, the duty of handing down unimpaired the Digha Nik\u00e1ya through his disciples was entrusted to \u00c1nanda (DA.i.15). He was also charged with the duty of conveying to Channa the news that the higher penalty (brahmadanda) had been inflicted on him by the Sangha. \u00c1nanda had been deputed by the Buddha himself to carry out this, his last administrative act (D.ii.154), but \u00c1nanda, not wishing to undertake the responsibility alone (knowing that Channa had a reputation for roughness), was granted a number of companions, with whom he visited Channa. The latter expressed repentance and was pardoned (Vin.ii.290-2). Perhaps it was because both the Buddha and \u00c1nanda's colleagues knew of his power to settle disputes that he was chosen for this delicate task. See S.ii.235f., where the Buddha classes him with S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na for his ability to settle disputes among the monks.</p><p>\u00c1nanda's popularity, however, did not", "save him from the recriminations of his fellows for some of his actions, which, in their eyes, constituted offences. Thus he was charged (Vin.ii.288-9) with: (1) having failed to find out from the Buddha which were the lesser and minor precepts which the Sangha were allowed to revoke if they thought fit (See D.ii.154); (2) with having stepped on the Buddha's rainy-season garment when sewing it; (3) with having allowed the Buddha's body to be first saluted by women (not mentioned elsewhere, but see Rockhill, op. cit., p.154); (4) with having omitted to ask the Buddha to live on for the space of a kappa (D.ii.115); and (5) with having exerted himself to procure the admission of women into the Order (Vin.ii.253).</p><p>\u00c1nanda's reply was that he himself saw no fault in any of these acts, but that he would confess them as faults out of faith in his colleagues.</p><p> </p><p>On another occasion he was found fault with (1) for having gone into the village to beg for alms, clothed in his waist-cloth and nether garment (Vin.i.298); (2) for having worn light garments which were blown about by the wind (Vin.ii.136).</p><p>The last years of his life, \u00c1nanda seems to have spent in teaching and preaching and in encouraging his younger colleagues. Among those who held discussions with him after the Buddha's passing away are mentioned Dasama of the Atthakanagara (M.i.349f), Gopaka Moggall\u00e1na (M.iii.7; Thag.ver.1024) and Subha Todeyyaputta (D.i.204ff).</p><p>The P\u00e1li Canon makes no mention of \u00c1nanda's death. Fa Hsien (Giles trans. 44. The story also occurs in DhA.ii.99ff., with several variations in detail), however, relates what was probably an old tradition. When \u00c1nanda was on his way from Magadha to Ves\u00e1li, there to die, Aj\u00e1tasattu heard that he was coming, and, with his retinue, followed him up to the Rohini River. The chiefs of Vesali also heard the news", "and went out to meet him, and both parties reached the river banks. \u00c1nanda, not wishing to incur the displeasure of either party, entered into the state of tejokasina in the middle of the river and his body went up in flames. His remains were divided into two portions, one for each party, and they built cetiyas for their enshrinement (See also Rockhill, op. cit., 165f).</p><p>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha \u00c1nanda had been the son of \u00c1nanda, King of Hamsavat\u00ed, and was therefore a step-brother of Padumuttara. His name was Sumana. King \u00c1nanda allowed no one but himself to wait on the Buddha. Prince Sumana having quelled an insurrection of the frontier provinces, the king offered him a boon as reward, and he asked to be allowed to entertain the Buddha and his monks for three months. With great reluctance the king agreed, provided the Buddha's consent was obtained. When Sumana went to the vih\u00e1ra to obtain this, he was greatly impressed by the loyalty and devotion of the Buddha's personal attendant, the monk Sumana, and by his iddhi-powers. Having learnt from the Buddha that these were the result of good deeds, he himself determined to lead a pious life. For the Buddha's residence Prince Sumana bought a pleasaunce named Sobhana from a householder of that same name and built therein a monastery costing one hundred thousand. On the way from the capital to Sobhana Park he built vih\u00e1ras, at distances of a league from each other. When all preparations were completed, the Buddha went to Sobhana with one hundred thousand monks, stopping at each vih\u00e1ra on the way. At the festival of dedication of the Sobhana Vih\u00e1ra, Sumana expressed a wish to become a personal attendant of a future Buddha, just as Sumana was of Padumuttara. Towards this end he did many good deeds. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave his upper garment to a monk for him to carry his begging-bowl in it. Later he was born in", "heaven and again as King of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')\">Benares</a>. He built for eight Pacceka Buddhas eight monasteries in his royal park (ThagA.ii.121ff) and for ten thousand years he looked after them.

In the Canonical account (E.g., Vin.ii.182) he became a monk in the second year of the Buddha's ministry. In the verses attributed to him in the Therag\u00e1tha (Vers.1039ff), however, he says that he has been for twenty five years a learner (sekha). It is concluded from this that \u00c1nanda must have joined the Order only in the twentieth year after the Enlightenment and the whole story of his having been ordained at the same time as Devadatta is discredited. (See, e.g., Thomas: op. cit., 123. See also Rhys Davids' article on Devadatta in ERE). The verses occur in a lament by \u00c1nanda that his master is dead and that he is yet a learner. The twenty-five years which \u00c1nanda mentions probably refer to the period during which he had been the Buddha's personal attendant and not to his whole career as a monk. During that period, \"though he was but a learner, no thoughts of evil arose in him,\" the", "implication being that his close connection with the Buddha and his devotion to him gave no room for such. He, nevertheless, laments that he could not become an asekha while the Buddha was yet alive. If this interpretation be accepted - and I see no reason why it should not be - there is no discrepancy in the accounts of \u00c1nanda's ordination.</p><hr><p><b>2. \u00c1nanda.</b>-A Khattiya king of Hamsavati, father of Padumuttara Buddha (J.i.37; Bu.xii.19).

He was one of the six monsters of the deep. He lived on one side of the ocean and all the fishes came to him morning and evening to pay their respects. He lived on rock-slime (sev\u00e1la) till one day he swallowed, by mistake, a fish. Liking the taste very much, be found out what it was, and from that day he ate fish, unknown to his subjects. Seeing their numbers diminish, they began to grow inquisitive, and one day one of their wise ones hid in the lobe of \u00c1nanda's ear and discovered him eating the fish which straggled behind. When this was reported to the other fish, they fled in terror and hid themselves. \u00c1nanda, desirous of eating them, searched everywhere; believing that they lay inside a mountain, he encircled it with his body. Seeing his own tail on the other side of the mountain and believing it to be a fish trying to escape, he crunched it in a rage. The tail was fifty leagues long and he suffered excruciating pain. Attracted by the smell of blood, the fish collected round and ate him bit by bit. His skeleton was as big as a mountain, and holy ascetics, flying through the air and seeing it below them, told men about it and the story became famous throughout Jambud\u00edpa. K\u00e1lahatthi", "is reported as relating this story to the king in the Mah\u00e1 Sutasoma J\u00e1taka (J.v.462-4). \u00c1nanda is referred to as an example of great deceitfulness.

When the banker died he was born in a Cand\u00e1la family outside the city gates. The king appointed M\u00falasiri banker in his place. </p><p>From the time of \u00c1nanda's conception among the Cand\u00e1las, misfortune dogged their footsteps. Knowing that a Jonah had come among them, they caused a search to be made and, as a result of their investigations, they sent the pregnant mother away. When the child was born he was a monstrosity with his organs all out of place. When old enough, he was given a potsherd and told to beg his living. One day he came to the house in which he had lived in his former life, and though he managed to enter it, he was discovered and thrown out by the servants. The Buddha happened to be passing by, and sending for M\u00falasiri, he told him that the beggar had been his father. Being convinced by certain proofs, M\u00falasiri believed and took refuge in the Buddha (DhA.ii.25-8; the story is referred to in the Milindapa\u00f1ha p.350).

(330f), give quite different accounts.</p><p> </p><p>In the Ariyaparives\u00e1na Sutta (M.i.163-5; also 240ff; ii.94ff, 212ff) the Buddha describes his visit to \u00c1l\u00e1ra. Gotama quickly mastered his doctrine and was able to repeat it by heart; but feeling sure that \u00c1l\u00e1ra not only knew the doctrine but had realised it, he approached him and questioned him about it. \u00c1l\u00e1ra then proclaimed the \u00c1ki\u00f1ca\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1yatana, and Gotama, putting forth energy and concentration greater than \u00c1l\u00e1ra's, made himself master of that state. \u00c1l\u00e1ra recognised his pupil's eminence and treated him as an equal, but Gotama, not having succeeded in his quest, took leave of \u00c1l\u00e1ra to go elsewhere (VibhA.432). When, after having practised austerities for six years, the Buddha attained Enlightenment and granted Sahampati's request to preach the doctrine, it was of \u00c1l\u00e1ra he thought first as being the fittest to hear the teaching.

Pukkusa describes \u00c1l\u00e1ra to the Buddha as one who practised great concentration.

Whether this statement is handed down with any real knowledge of the facts of his teaching, it is not now possible to say. Asvaghosa, in his Buddhacarita (xii.17ff), puts into the mouth of \u00c1r\u00e1da or \u00c1l\u00e1ra, a brief account of his philosophy. It has some resemblance - though this is slight - to the S\u00e1nkhya philosophy, but in \u00c1l\u00e1ra\u2019s teaching some of the salient characteristics of the S\u00e1nkhya system are absent. In reply to Gotama's questions about the religious life and the obtaining of final release, \u00c1l\u00e1ra describes a system of spiritual development which is identical with the methods of the Buddhist monk up to the last attainment but one. The monk reaches the four jh\u00e1nas and then attains successively to the states of space, infinity and nothingness. The last three stages are described in the terms of the first three of the four Attainments. (For a discussion on this see Thomas, op. cit., p.229-30; see also MA.ii.881; VibhA.432). According to Buddhaghosa (AA.i.458), Bharandu K\u00e1l\u00e1ma was a disciple of \u00c1l\u00e1ra at the same time as Gotama and is therefore described as the Buddha's pur\u00e1na-sabrahmac\u00e1r\u00ed (A.i.277). Buddhaghosa further tells us (DA.ii.569) that in \u00c1l\u00e1ra K\u00e1l\u00e1ma, \u00c1l\u00e1ra was his personal name.

The Buddha, on several occasions, stayed at \u00c1lav\u00ed at the Agg\u00e1lava shrine (q.v.) which was near the town. In the sixteenth year after the Enlightenment, the Buddha spent the whole of the rainy season at \u00c1lav\u00ed and preached the doctrine to 84,000 listeners (BuA.3). The King of \u00c1lav\u00ed was known as \u00c1lavaka and the inhabitants as \u00c1lavaka. The town later became famous as the residence of \u00c1lavaka Yakkha and of Hatthaka \u00c1lavaka.

Meanwhile at \u00c1lav\u00ed the Buddha and his monks had been served with a meal by the people, but the Buddha waited until the farmer came before returning thanks. On the farmer's arrival the Buddha ordered that some food should be given him, and when the man was comforted and his mind was ready the Buddha preached a sermon, at the end of which the man became a Sot\u00e1panna (DhA.iii.262-3).</p><p>On another occasion the Buddha came all the way from Jetavana to \u00c1lav\u00ed for the sake of a weaver's daughter.

On the occasion of the Buddha's visit to \u00c1pana, during which he converted Sela and Keniya, he seems to have stayed at \u00c1pana for over a week and ordained three hundred monks in the company of Sela (Sn., p.112).</p><p>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.586), the village was called \u00c1pana because it had twenty thousand bazaars (\u00e1pan\u00e1) and was therefore distinguished for its shops (\u00e1pan\u00e1nam ussannatt\u00e1). Near the village, on the banks of the river Mah\u00ed, was the woodland where the Buddha stayed during his visits.</p><hr><hr>"}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>\u00c1y\u00e1citabhatta J\u00e1taka (No. 19)</h2>  </li></ul><p>Once the squire of a certain village, in the K\u00e1si country, promised the deity of a banyan tree a sacrifice should his enterprise succeed.
