He returns to the capital and devotes himself to good works (J.v.98ff).</p><p>The introductory story is given in the R\u00e1jov\u00e1da J\u00e1taka (q.v.).</p><hr><hr>"}, {"data": ["<ul>  <li>  <h2>Garud\u00e1, Garul\u00e1</h2>  </li></ul><p>A class of mythical birds generally mentioned in company with <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga')\">N\u00e1gas</a> (E.g., J.iv.181, 202). </p><p>They live in Simbali-groves (E.g., J.i.202) and are usually huge in size, sometimes one hundred and fifty leagues from wing to wing (J.iii.397).

This wind can plunge a whole city in darkness and cause houses to fall through its violence (J.iii.188). </p><p>A Garula has strength great enough to carry off a whole banyan tree, tearing it up from its roots (J.vi.177). The Garulas are the eternal enemies of the N\u00e1gas (J.ii.13; iii.103) and live in places, such as the Seruma Island (J.iii.187), where N\u00e1gas are to be found. The greatest happiness of the N\u00e1gas is to be free from the attacks of the Garulas (J.iv.463). A Garula's plumage is so thick that a man - e.g., <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/n/n2_ny')\">Natakuvera</a> (J.iii.91) - could hide in it, unnoticed by the bird. Sometimes Garulas assume human form; two Garula kings are said to have played dice with kings of <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')\">Benares</a> and to have fallen in love with their queens, whom they took to the Garula city - one of the queens being <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/s/sussondii_jat_360')\">Sussond\u00ed</a> (J.iii.187) and the other <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaakaatii_jat_327')\">K\u00e1k\u00e1t\u00ed</a> (J.iii.91).

It is said that in olden days the Garulas did not know how to seize N\u00e1gas effectively; they caught them by the bead, and the N\u00e1gas who had swallowed big stones were too heavy to be lifted from the", "ground; consequently the Garulas died of exhaustion in trying to carry them.

Before his conception he was in the Tusita heaven, waiting for the due time for his birth in his last existence. Then, having made the \"five investigations\" (pa\u00f1cavilolcan\u00e1ni) (see Buddha), he took leave of his companions and descended to earth. (According to the Lalitavistara he appointed the Bodhisatta Maitreya as king of Tusita in his place). Many", "wondrous and marvellous events attended his conception and birth. (Given in the Acchariyabbhutadhamma Sutta, M.iii.118f; also D.ii.12f. A more detailed account is found in J.i.47ff; both the Lai. and the Mtu.ii.14ff differ as to the details given here of the conception and the birth). </p><p> </p><p>The conception takes place on the full-moon day of \u00c1s\u00e1lha, with the moon in Uttar\u00e1s\u00e1lha, and Maya has no relations with her husband. She has a marvellous dream in which the Bodhisatta, as a white elephant, enters her womb through her side. When the dream is mentioned to the brahmins, they foretell the birth of a son who will be either a universal monarch or a Buddha. An earthquake takes place and thirty-two signs appear, presaging the birth of a great being. The first of these signs is a boundless, great light, flooding every corner of the ten thousand worlds; everyone beholds its glory, even the fires in all hells being extinguished. Ten months after the conception, in the month of Vis\u00e1kha, M\u00e1y\u00e1 wishes to visit her parents in Devadaha. On the way thither from Kapilavatthu she passes the beautiful Lumbini grove, in which she desires to wander; she goes to a great s\u00e1la-tree and seizes a branch in her hand; labour pains start immediately, and, when the courtiers retire, having drawn a curtain round her, even while standing, she is delivered of the child. It is the day of the full moon of Vis\u00e1kha; four Mah\u00e1brahmas receive the babe in a golden net, and streams of water descend from the sky to wash him. The boy stands on the earth, takes seven steps north-wards and utters his lion-roar, \"I am the chief in the world.\" On the same day seven other beings were born: the Bodhi-tree, R\u00e1hula's mother (R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1, his future wife), the four Treasure-Troves (described at DA.i.284), his elephant, his horse Kanthaka, his charioteer Channa, and K\u00e1lud\u00e1y\u00ed. The babe is escorted back to Kapilavatthu", "on the day of his birth and his mother dies seven days later.</p><p> </p><p>The isi Asita (or K\u00e1ladevala), meditating in the Him\u00e1laya, learns from the T\u00e1vatimsa gods of the birth of the Buddha, visits Suddhodana the same day and sees the boy, whom they both worship. Asita weeps for sorrow that he will not live to see the boy's Buddhahood, but he instructs his nephew N\u00e1laka (v.l. Naradatta) to prepare himself for that great day. On the fifth day after the birth is the ceremony of name-giving. One hundred and eight brahmins are invited to the festival at the palace; eight of them - R\u00e1ma, Dhaja, Lakkhana, Manti, Konda\u00f1\u00f1a, Bhoja, Suy\u00e1ma and Sudatta - are interpreters of bodily marks, and all except Konda\u00f1\u00f1a prophesy two possibilities for the boy; but Konda\u00f1\u00f1a, the youngest, says, quite decisively, that he will be a Buddha. The name given to the boy at this ceremony is not actually mentioned, but from other passages it is inferred that it was Siddhattha (q.v.).</p><p> </p><p>Among other incidents recounted of the Buddha's boyhood is that of his attaining the first jh\u00e1na under a jambu-tree. One day he is taken to the state ploughing of the king where Suddhodana himself, with his golden plough, ploughs with the farmers. The nurses, attracted by the festivities, leave the child under a jambu-tree. They return to find him seated, cross-legged, in a trance, the shadow of the tree remaining still, in order to protect him. The king is informed and, for the second time, does reverence to his son. J.i.57f; MA.i.466f; the incident is alluded to in the Mah\u00e1 Saccaka Sutta (M.i.246); the corresponding incident recounted in Mtu. (ii.45f.) takes place in a park, and the, details differ completely. The Lai. has two versions, one in prose and one in verse and both resemble the Mtu.; but in these the Buddha is represented as being much older. The Divy (391) and the Tibetan", "versions (e.g., Rockhill, p.22) put the incident very much later in the Buddha's life. Other incidents are given in Lai. and Mtu.</p><p> </p><p>The Bodhisatta is reported to have lived in the household for twenty-nine years a life of great luxury and excessive ease, surrounded by all imaginable comforts. He owns three palaces - Ramma, Suramma and Subha - for the three seasons. Mention is made of his luxurious life in A.i.145; also in M.i.504; further details are given in AA.i.378f.; J.i.58. See also Mtu.ii.115; cf. Vin.i.15; D.ii.21.</p><p> </p><p>When the Bodhisatta is sixteen years old, Suddhodana sends messengers to the S\u00e1kyans asking that his son be allowed to seek a wife from among their daughters; but the S\u00e1kyans are reluctant to send them, for, they say, though the young man is hand-some, he knows no art; how, then, can he support a wife? When this is reported to the prince, he summons an assembly of the S\u00e1kyans and performs various feats, chief of these being twelve feats with a bow which needs the strength of one thousand men. (The feats with the bow are described in the Sarabhanga J\u00e1taka, J.v.129f ). The S\u00e1kyans are so impressed that each sends him a daughter, the total number so sent being forty thousand. The Bodhisatta appoints as his chief wife the daughter of Suppabuddha, who, later, comes to be called R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1. She is known under various names: Bhaddakacc\u00e1 (or Kacc\u00e1n\u00e1), Yasodhar\u00e1. Bimb\u00e1, Bimbasundar\u00ed and Gop\u00e1. For a discussion see R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1.</p><p> </p><p>According to the generally accepted account, Gotama is twenty-nine when the incidents occur which lead to final renunciation. Following the prophecy of the eight brahmins, his father had taken every precaution that his son should see no sign of old age, sickness or death. But the gods decide that the time is come for the Enlightenment, and instil into", "Gotama's heart a desire to go into the park. On the way, the gods put before him a man showing signs of extreme age, and the Bodhisatta returns, filled with desire for renunciation. The king, learning this, surrounds him with even greater attractions, but on two other days Gotama goes to the park and the gods put before him a sick man and a corpse. (According to some accounts, e.g. that of the D\u00edghabh\u00e1nakas, the four omens were all seen on the same day, J.i.59)</p><p> </p><p>On the full-moon day of \u00c1s\u00e1lha, the day appointed for the Great Renunciation, Gotama sees a monk and hears from his charioteer praise of the ascetic life. Feeling very happy, he goes to the park to enjoy himself. Sakka sends Vissakamma himself to bathe and adorn him, and as Gotama returns to the city in all his majesty, he receives news of the birth of his son. Foreseeing in this news a bond, he decides to call the babe R\u00e1hula (q.v.). Kis\u00e1 Gotam\u00ed (q.v.) sees Gotama on the way to the palace and, filled with longing for him, sings to him a song containing the word nibbuta. The significance of the word (=extinguished, at peace) thrills him, and he sends to Kis\u00e1 his priceless gold necklace which she, however, accepts as a token of love. Gotama enters the palace and sleeps. He wakes in the middle of the night to find his female musicians sleeping in attitudes which fill him with disgust and with loathing for the worldly life, and he decides to leave it. (In some versions the Renunciation takes place seven days after the birth of R\u00e1hula, J.i.62). He orders Channa to saddle Kanthaka, and enters his wife's room for a last look at her and their son.</p><p> </p><p>He leaves the city on his horse Kanthaka, with Channa clinging to its tail. The devas muffle the sound of the horse's hoofs and of his neighing and open the city gates for Gotama to pass. M\u00e1ra", "appears before Gotama and seeks to stay him with a promise that he shall be universal monarch within seven days. On his offer being refused, M\u00e1ra threatens to shadow him always. Outside the city, at the spot where later was erected the Kanthakanivattana-cetiya, Gotama turns his horse round to take a last look at Kapilavatthu. It is said that the earth actually turned, to make it easy for him to do so. Then, accompanied by the gods, he rides thirty leagues through three kingdoms - those of the S\u00e1kyans, the Koliyans and the Mallas - and his horse crosses the river Anom\u00e1 in one leap. On the other side, he gives all his ornaments to Channa, and with his sword cuts off hair and beard, throwing them up into the air, where Sakka takes them and enshrines them in the C\u00fal\u00e1mani-cetiya in T\u00e1vatimsa. The Brahm\u00e1 Ghatik\u00e1ra offers Gotama the eight requisites of a monk, which he accepts and adopts. He then sends Channa and Kanthaka back to his father, but Kanthaka, broken-hearted, dies on the spot and is reborn as Kanthaka-devaputta. </p><p> </p><p>The account given here is taken mainly from the Nid\u00e1nakath\u00e1 (J.i.59ff) and evidently embodies later tradition; cp. D.ii.21ff. From passages found in the Pitakas (e.g., A.i.145; M.i.163, 240; M.ii.212f.) it would appear that the events leading up to the Renunciation were not so dramatic as given here, the process being more gradual. I do not, however, agree with Thomas (op. cit., 58) that, according to these accounts, the Bodhisatta left the world when \"quite a boy.\" I think the word dahara is used merely to indicate \"the prime of youth,\" and not necessarily \"boyhood.\" The description of the Renunciation in the Lal. is very much more elaborate and adds numerous incidents, no account of which is found in the P\u00e1li.</p><p> </p><p>From Anom\u00e1 the Bodhisatta goes to the", "mango-grove of Anupiya, and after spending seven days there walks to R\u00e1jagaha (a distance of thirty leagues) in one day, and there starts his alms rounds. Bimbis\u00e1ra's men, noticing him, report the matter to the king, who sends messengers to enquire who this ascetic is. The men follow Gotama to the foot of the Pandavapabbata, where he eats his meal, and they then go and report to the king. Bimbis\u00e1ra visits Gotama, and, pleased with his hearing, offers him the sovereignty. On learning the nature of Gotama's quest, he wins from him a promise to visit R\u00e1jagaha first after the Enlightenment.</p><p> </p><p>This incident is also mentioned in the Pabbajj\u00e1 Sutta (SN.vv.405-24), but there it is the king who first sees Gotama. It is significant that, when asked his identity, Gotama does not say he is a king's son. The Pali version of tile sutta contains nothing of Gotama's promise to visit R\u00e1jagaha, but the Mtu. version (ii.198-200), which places the visit later, has two verses, one of which contains the request and the other the acceptance; and the SNA. (ii.385f.), too, mentions the promise and tells that Bimbis\u00e1ra was informed of the prophecy concerning Gotama. There is another version of the Mtu. (ii.117-20) which says that Gotama went straight to Vais\u00e1li after leaving home, joining \u00c1l\u00e1ra, and later visited Uddaka at R\u00e1jagaha. Here no mention is made of Bimbis\u00e1ra. We are told in the Mhv. (ii.25ff) that Bimbis\u00e1ra and Gotama (Siddhattha) had been playmates, Bimbis\u00e1ra being the younger by five years. Bimbis\u00e1ra's father (Bh\u00e1t\u00ed) and Suddhodana were friends.</p><p> </p><p>Journeying from R\u00e1jagaha, Gotama in due course becomes a disciple of \u00c1l\u00e1ra-K\u00e1l\u00e1ma. Having learnt and practised all that \u00c1l\u00e1ra has to teach, he finds it unsatisfying and joins Uddaka-R\u00e1maputta; but Uddaka's doctrine leaves him still unconvinced and he abandons it. He then goes", "to Sen\u00e1n\u00edg\u00e1ma in Uruvel\u00e1 and there, during six years, practises all manner of severe austerities, such as no man had previously undertaken. Once he falls fainting and a deva informs Suddhodana that Gotama is dead. But Suddhodana, relying on the prophecy of K\u00e1ladevala, refuses to believe the news. Gotama's mother, now born as a devaputta in T\u00e1vatimsa, comes to him to encourage him. At Uruvel\u00e1, the Pa\u00f1cavaggiya monks are his companions, but now, having realised the folly of extreme asceticism, he decides to abandon it, and starts again to take normal food; thereupon the Pa\u00f1cavaggiyas, disappointed, leave him and go to Isipatana.</p><blockquote>  <p>J.i.66f. The Ther\u00edg\u00e1th\u00e1 Commentary   (p.2) mentions another teacher of Gotama, named Bhaggava, whom Gotama visited   before \u00c1l\u00e1ra. Lal. (330 [264]) contains a very elaborate account of Gotama's   visits to teachers; he goes first to two brahmin women, S\u00e1k\u00ed and Padm\u00e1, then   to Raivata and Rajaka, son of Trimandika, and finally (as far as this chapter   is concerned) to \u00c1l\u00e1ra at Vais\u00e1li. A poem containing an account of the meeting   of Gotama with Bimbis\u00e1ra is inserted into this account. The next chapter tells   of Uddaka. An account of Gotama's visits to teachers and of the details of his   austerities is also given in the Mah\u00e1 Saccaka Sutta, already referred to   (M.i.240ff); the Mah\u00e1 S\u00edhan\u00e1da Sutta (M.i.77ff) contains a long and detailed   account of his extreme asceticisms. See also M.i.163ff; ii.93f.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>Gotama's desire for normal food is satisfied by an offering brought by Suj\u00e1t\u00e1 to the Ajap\u00e1la banyan tree under which he is seated. She had made a vow to the tree, and her wish having been granted, she takes her slave-girl, Punn\u00e1, and goes to the tree prepared to fulfil her promise. They take Gotama to be the Tree-god, come in person to", "accept her offering of milk-rice; the offering is made in a golden bowl and he takes it joyfully. Five dreams he had the night before convince Gotama that he will that day become the Buddha. (The dreams are, recounted in A.iii.240 and in Mtu.ii.136f). It is the full-moon day of Vis\u00e1kha; he bathes at Suppatittha in the Nera\u00f1jar\u00e1, eats the food and launches the bowl up stream, where it sinks to the abode of the N\u00e1ga king, K\u00e1la (Mah\u00e1k\u00e1la).</p><p> </p><p>Gotama spends the rest of the day in a s\u00e1la-grove and, in the evening, goes to the foot of the Bodhi-tree, accompanied by various divinities; there the grass-cutter Sotthiya gives him eight handfuls of grass; these, after investigation, Gotama spreads on the eastern side of the tree, where it becomes a seat fourteen hands long, on which he sits cross-legged, determined not to rise before attaining Enlightenment.</p><p>J.i.69. The Pitakas know nothing of Suj\u00e1t\u00e1's offering or of Sotthiya's gift. Lal. (334-7 [267-70]) mentions ten girls in all who provide him with food during his austerities. Divy (392) mentions two, Nand\u00e1 and Nandabal\u00e1.</p><p> </p><p>M\u00e1ra, lord of the world of passion, is determined to prevent this fulfilment, and attacks Gotama with all the strength at his command. His army extends twelve leagues to the front, right, and left of him, to the end of the Cakkav\u00e1la behind him, and nine leagues into the sky above him. M\u00e1ra himself carries numerous weapons and rides the elephant Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height. At the sight of him all the divinities gathered at the Bodhi-tree to do honour to Gotama - the great Brahm\u00e1, Sakka, the N\u00e1ga-king Mah\u00e1k\u00e1la - disappear in a flash, and Gotama is left alone with the ten p\u00e1ram\u00ed, long practised by him, as his sole protection. All M\u00e1ra's attempts to frighten him by means of storms and terrifying apparitions fail, and, in the", "end, M\u00e1ra hurls at him the Cakk\u00e1vudha. It remains as a canopy poised over Gotama. The very earth bears witness to Gotama's fitness to be the Enlightened One, and Girimekhala kneels before him. M\u00e1ra is vanquished and flees headlong with his vast army. The various divinities who had fled at the approach of M\u00e1ra now return to Gotama and exult in his triumph.</p><p>The whole story of the contest with M\u00e1ra is, obviously, a mythological development. It is significant that in the Majjhima passages referred to earlier there is no mention of M\u00e1ra, of a temptation, or even of a Bodhi-tree; but see D.ii.4 and Thomas (op. cit., n.1). According to the K\u00e1lingabodhi J\u00e1taka, which, very probably, embodies an old tradition, the bodhi-tree was worshipped even in the Buddha's life-time. The M\u00e1ra legend is, however, to be found in the Canonical Padh\u00e1na Sutta of the Sutta Nip\u00e1ta. This perhaps contains the first suggestion of the legend. For a discussion see M\u00e1ra.</p><p> </p><p>Gotama spends that night in deep meditation. In the first watch he gains remembrance of his former existences; in the middle watch he attains the divine eye (dibbacakkhu); in the last watch he revolves in his mind the Chain of Causation (paticcasamupp\u00e1da). As he masters this, the earth trembles and, with the dawn, comes Enlightenment. He is now the supreme Buddha, and he breaks forth into a paean of joy (ud\u00e1na).</p><p>There is great doubt as to which were these Ud\u00e1na verses. The Nid\u00e1nakath\u00e1 and the Commentaries generally quote two verses (153, 154) included in the Dhammapada collection (anekaj\u00e1ti sams\u00e1ram, etc.). The Vinaya (i.2) quotes three different verses (as does also DhsA.17), and says that one verse was repeated at the end of each watch, all the watches being occupied with meditation on the paticcasamupp\u00e1da. Mtu. (ii.286) gives a completely different Ud\u00e1na, and in another place (ii.416) mentions a different", "verse as the first Ud\u00e1na. The Tibetan Vinaya is, again, quite different (Rockhill, p.33). For a discussion see Thomas, op. cit., 75ff.</p><p> </p><p>For the first week the Buddha remains under the Bodhi-tree, meditating on the Paticcasamupp\u00e1da; the second week he spends at the Ajap\u00e1lanigrodha, where the \"Huhuhka\" Brahmin accosts him (Mara now comes again and asks the Buddha to die at once; D.ii.112) and where Mara's daughters, Tanh\u00e1, Arat\u00ed and R\u00e1g\u00e1, appear before the Buddha and make a last attempt to shake his resolution (J.i.78; S.i.124; Lal.490 (378)); the third week he spends under the hood of the n\u00e1ga-king Mucalinda (Vin.i.3); the fourth week is spent in meditation under the R\u00e1j\u00e1yatana tree*; at the end of this period takes place the conversion of Tapussa and Bhallika. They take refuge in the Buddha and the Dhamma, though the Buddha does not give them any instruction.</p><blockquote>  <p>*This is the Vinaya account   (Vin.i.1ff); but the J\u00e1taka (i.77ff, extends this period to seven weeks, the   additional weeks being inserted between the first and second. The Buddha   spends one week each at the Animisa-cetiya, the Ratanacankama and the   Ratanaghara, and this last is where he thinks out the Abhidhamma Pitaka.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>Doubts now assail the Buddha as to whether he shall proclaim to the world his doctrine, so recondite, so hard to understand. The Brahma Sahampati (according to J.i.81, with the gods of the thousand worlds, including Sakka, Suy\u00e1ma, Santusita, Sunimmita, Vasavatti, etc.) appears before him and assures him there are many prepared to listen to him and to profit by his teaching, and so entreats him to teach the Dhamma. The Buddha accedes to his request and, after consideration, decides to teach the Dhamma first to the Pa\u00f1cavaggiyas at Isipatana. On the way to", "<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')\">Benares</a> he meets the \u00c1j\u00edvaka Upaka and tells him that he (the Buddha) is Jina. On his arrival at Isipatana the Pa\u00f1cavaggiyas are, at first, reluctant to acknowledge his claim to be the Tath\u00e1gata, but they let themselves be won over and, on the full-moon day of \u00c1s\u00e1lha, the Buddha preaches to them the sermon which came to be known as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. (Vin.i.4ff; M.i.118ff; cp. D.ii.36ff. Regarding the claim of this sutta to be the Buddha's first sermon, see Thomas, op. cit., p.86; see also Pa\u00f1cavaggiy\u00e1). At the end of the sermon Konda\u00f1\u00f1a becomes a sot\u00e1panna and they all become monks.</p><p> </p><p>This sermon is followed five days later by the Anattalakkhana Sutta, at the conclusion of which all five become arahants. The following day the Buddha meets Yasa, whom he converts. Yasa's father, who comes seeking him, is the first to take the threefold formula of Refuge.</p><p> </p><p>Yasa becomes an arahant and is ordained. The Buddha accepts a meal at his house, and Yasa's mother and one of his former wives are the first two lay-women to become the Buddha's disciples. Then four friends of Yasa and, afterwards, fifty more, enter the Order and become arahants. There are now sixty arahants besides the Buddha, and they are sent in different directions to preach the Dhamma. They return with many candidates for admission to the Order, and the Buddha, who up till now had ordained men with the \"ehi bhikkhu\" formula, now allows the monks themselves to perform the ceremony of ordination (Vin.i.15ff; J.i.81f).</p><p> </p><p>After spending the rainy season at Benares (about this time M\u00e1ra twice tries to tempt the Buddha, once after he had sent the disciples out to preach and once after the Retreat, S.i.105, 111; Vin.i.21, 22), the Buddha returns to Sen\u00e1nig\u00e1ma in Uruvela, on the way", "converting and ordaining the thirty Bhaddavaggiy\u00e1. At Uruvela, after a long and protracted exercise of magical powers, consisting in all of three thousand five hundred miracles, the Buddha wins over the three Kassapa brothers, the Tebh\u00e1tika Jatil\u00e1, with their thousand followers, and ordains them. They become arahants after listening to the \u00c1dittapariy\u00e1ya Sutta preached at Gay\u00e1s\u00edsa; with these followers he visits R\u00e1jagaha, where King Seniya Bimbis\u00e1ra comes to see him at the Latthivanuyy\u00e1na. The following day the Buddha and the monks visit the palace, preceded by Sakka disguised as a youth and singing the praises of the Buddha. After the meal, the king gifts Veluvana to the Buddha and the Order. The Buddha stays for two months at R\u00e1jagaha (BuA.4), and it is during this time that S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na join the Order, through the instrumentality of Assaji (Vin.i.23ff). It was probably during this year, at the beginning of the rainy season, that the Buddha visited Ves\u00e1li at the request of the Licchavis, conveyed through Mah\u00e1li. The city was suffering from pestilence and famine. The Buddha went, preached the Ratana Sutta and dispelled all dangers (DhA.iii.436ff).</p><p> </p><p>The number of converts now rapidly increases and the people of Magadha, alarmed by the prospect of childlessness, widow-hood, etc., blame the Buddha and his monks. The Buddha, however, refutes their charges (Vin.i.42f).</p><p>The account of the first twenty years of the Buddha's ministry is summarised from various sources, chiefly from Thomas's admirable account in his Life and Legend of the Buddha (pp.97ff). The necessary references are to be found under the names mentioned.</p><p> </p><p>On the full-moon day of Phagguna (February-March) the Buddha, accompanied by twenty thousand monks, sets out for Kapilavatthu at the express request of his father, conveyed through K\u00e1lud\u00e1y\u00ed.", "(This visit is not mentioned in the Canon; but see Thag.527-36; AA.i.107, 167; J.i.87; DhA.i.96f; ThagA.i.997ff). </p><p> </p><p>By slow stages he arrives at the city, where he stays at the Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma, and, in order to convince his proud kinsmen of his power, performs the Yamakap\u00e1tih\u00e1rjya and then relates the Vessantara J\u00e1taka. The next day, receiving no invitation to a meal, the Buddha begs in the streets of the city; this deeply grieves Suddhodana, but later, learning that it is the custom of all Buddhas, he becomes a sot\u00e1panna and conducts the Buddha and his monks to meal at the palace. There all the women of the palace, excepting only R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1, come and do reverence to the Buddha. Mah\u00e1 Paj\u00e1pat\u00ed becomes a sot\u00e1panna and Suddhodana a sakad\u00e1g\u00e1mi. The Buddha visits R\u00e1hulam\u00e1t\u00e1 in her own apartments and utters her praises in the Candakinnara J\u00e1taka. The following day the Buddha persuades his half-brother, Nanda, to come to the monastery, where he ordains him and, on the seventh day, he does the same with R\u00e1hula. This is too great a blow for Suddhodana, and at his request the Buddha rules that no person shall be ordained without the consent of his parents. The next day the Buddha preaches to Suddhodana, who becomes an an\u00e1g\u00e1m\u00ed. During the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu, eighty thousand S\u00e1kyans join the Order, one from each family. With these he returns to R\u00e1jagaha, stopping on the way at Anupiya, where Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila and Devadatta, together with their barber, Up\u00e1li, visit him and seek ordination.</p><p> </p><p>On his return to R\u00e1jagaha the Buddha resides in the S\u00edtavana. (J.i.92, the story is also told in the Vinaya ii.154, but no date is indicated). There Sudatta, later known as An\u00e1thapindika, visits him, is converted, and invites him to S\u00e1vatthi. The Buddha accepts the", "invitation and journeys through Ves\u00e1li to S\u00e1vatthi, there to pass the rainy season. (Vin.ii.158; but see BuA.3, where the Buddha is mentioned as having spent the vassa in R\u00e1jagaha). An\u00e1thapindika gifts Jetavana, provided with every necessity, for the residence of the Buddha and his monks. Probably to this period belongs the conversion of Mig\u00e1ra, father-in-law of Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1, and the construction, by Vis\u00e1kh\u00e1, of the Pubb\u00e1r\u00e1ma at S\u00e1vatthi. The vassa of the fourth year the Buddha spends at Veluvana, where he converts Uggasena. (DhA.iv.59f). In the fifth year Suddhodana dies, having realised arahant-ship, and the Buddha flies through the air, from the K\u00fat\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1 in Ves\u00e1li where he was staying, to preach to his father on his death-bed. According to one account it is at this time that the quarrel breaks out between the S\u00e1kyans and the Koliyans regarding the irrigation of the river Rohin\u00ed. (AA.i.186; SNA.i.357; ThigA.141; details of the quarrel are given in J.v.412ff). The Buddha persuades them to make peace, and takes up his abode in the Nigrodh\u00e1r\u00e1ma. Mah\u00e1 Paj\u00e1pat\u00ed Gotam\u00ed, with other S\u00e1kiyan women, visits him there and asks that women may be allowed to join the Order. Three times the request is made, three times refused, the Buddha then returning to Ves\u00e1li. The women cut off their hair, don yellow robes and follow him thither. Ananda intercedes on their behalf and their request is granted. (Vin.ii.253ff; A.iv.274f.; for details see Mah\u00e1 Paj\u00e1pati).</p><p>In the sixth year the Buddha again performs the Yamakap\u00e1tih\u00e1riya, this time at the foot of the Gandamba tree in S\u00e1vatthi. Prior to this, the Buddha had forbidden any display of magic powers, but makes an exception in his own case (DhA.iii.199f.; J.iv.265, etc.).</p><p> </p><p>He spends the vassa at Mankulapabbata. After the performance of the miracle he follows the custom of all Buddhas and", "ascends to T\u00e1vatimsa in three strides to preach the Abhidhamma to his mother who is born there as a deva, and there he keeps the seventh vassa. The multitude, gathered at S\u00e1vatthi at the Yamakap\u00e1tih\u00e1riya, refuse to go away until they have seen him. For three months, therefore, Moggall\u00e1na expounds to them the Dhamma, while Culla An\u00e1thapindika provides them with food. During the preaching of the Abhidhamma, S\u00e1riputta visits the Buddha daily and learns from him all that has been recited the previous day. At the end of the vassa, the Buddha descends a jewelled staircase and comes to earth at Sankassa, thirty leagues from S\u00e1vatthi. (For details see Devorohana). It was about this time, when the Buddha's fame was at its height, that the notorious Ci\u00f1c\u00e1-m\u00e1navik\u00e1 was persuaded by members of some hostile sect to bring a vile accusation against the Buddha. A similar story, told in connection with a paribb\u00e1jik\u00e1 named Sundar\u00ed, probably refers to a later date.</p><p> </p><p>The eighth year the Buddha spends in the country of the Bhaggas and there, while residing in Bhesakal\u00e1vana near Sumsum\u00e1ragiri, he meets Nakulapit\u00e1 and his wife, who had been his parents in five hundred former births (A.A.i.217). </p><p>The same is told of another old couple in S\u00e1keta. See the S\u00e1keta J\u00e1taka. The Buddha evidently stayed again at Sumsum\u00e1ragiri many years later. It was during his second visit that Bodhir\u00e1jakum\u00e1ra (q.v.) invited him to a meal at his new palace in order that the Buddha might consecrate the building by his presence.</p><p> </p><p>In the ninth year the Buddha is at Kosamb\u00ed. While on a visit to the Kuru country he is offered in marriage M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1, the beautiful daughter of the brahmin M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1. The refusal of the offer, accompanied by insulting remarks about physical beauty, arouses the enmity of M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 who, thenceforward, cherishes hatred against the Buddha.", "</p><p>SN., pp.163ff; SNA.ii.542ff; DhA.i.199ff Thomas (op. cit., 109) assigns the M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 incident to the ninth year. I am not sure if this is correct, for the Commentaries say the Buddha was then living at S\u00e1vatthi.</p><p> </p><p>In the tenth year there arises among the monks at Kosamb\u00ed a schism which threatens the very existence of the Order. The Buddha, failing in his attempts to reconcile the disputants, retires in disgust to the P\u00e1rileyyaka forest, passing on his way through B\u00e1lakalonak\u00e1rag\u00e1ma and P\u00e1c\u00ednavamsad\u00e1ya. In the forest he is protected and waited upon by a friendly elephant who has left the herd. The Buddha spends the rainy season there and returns to S\u00e1vatthi. By this time the Kosamb\u00ed monks have recovered their senses and ask the Buddha's pardon. This is granted and the dispute settled. (Vin.i.337ff; J.iii.486f; DhA.i.44ff; but see Ud.iv.5; s.v. P\u00e1rileyyaka).</p><p> </p><p>In the eleventh year the Buddha resides at the brahmin village of Ekan\u00e1l\u00e1 and converts Kasi-Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1ja (SN., p.12f.; S.i.172f). The twelfth year he spends at Vera\u00f1j\u00e1, keeping the vassa there at the request of the brahmin Vera\u00f1ja. But Vera\u00f1ja forgets his obligations; there is a famine, and five hundred horse-merchants supply the monks with food. Moggall\u00e1na's offer to obtain food by means of magic power is discouraged (Vin.iii.1ff; J.iii.494f; DhA.ii.153). The thirteenth Retreat is kept at C\u00e1likapabbata, where Meghiya is the Buddha's personal attendant (A.iv.354; Ud.iv.1). The fourteenth year is spent at S\u00e1vatthi, and there R\u00e1hula receives the upasampad\u00e1 ordination.</p><p> </p><p>In the fifteenth year the Buddha revisits Kapilavatthu, and there his father-in-law, Suppabuddha, in a drunken fit, refuses to let the Buddha pass through the streets. Seven days later he is swallowed up by the earth at the foot of his palace (DhA.iii.44).</p>", "<p>The chief event of the sixteenth year, which the Buddha spent at \u00c1lav\u00ed, is the conversion of the yakkha \u00c1lavaka. In the seventeenth year the Buddha is back at S\u00e1vatthi, but he visits \u00c1lav\u00ed again out of compassion for a poor farmer who becomes a sot\u00e1panna after hearing him preach (DhA.iii.262ff). He spends the rainy season at R\u00e1jagaha. In the next year he again comes to \u00c1lav\u00ed from Jetavana for the sake of a poor weaver's daughter. She had heard him preach, three years earlier, on the desirability of meditating upon death. She alone gave heed to his admonition and, when the Buddha knows of her imminent death, he journeys thirty leagues to preach to her and establish her in the sot\u00e1pattiphala (DhA.iii.170ff).</p><p> </p><p>The Retreat of this year and also that of the nineteenth are spent at C\u00e1likapabbata. In the twentieth year takes place the miraculous conversion of the robber Angulim\u00e1la. He becomes an arahant and dies shortly after. It is in the same year that Ananda is appointed permanent attendant on the Buddha, a position which he holds to the end of the Buddha's life, twenty-five years later (For details see Ananda). The twentieth Retreat is spent at R\u00e1jagaha.</p><p> </p><p>With our present knowledge it is impossible to evolve any kind of chronology for the remaining twenty-five years of the Buddha's life. The Commentaries state that they were spent at S\u00e1vatthi in the monasteries of Jetavana and Pubb\u00e1r\u00e1ma. (E.g., BuA.3; SNA. p.336f, says that when the Buddha was at S\u00e1vatthi, he spent the day at the Mig\u00e1ram\u00e1tup\u00e1s\u00e1da in the Pubb\u00e1r\u00e1ma, and the night at Jetavana or vice versa).</p><p> </p><p>This, probably, only implies that the Retreats were kept there and that they were made the head quarters of the Buddha. From there, during the dry season, he went every year on tour in various", "districts. Among the places visited by him during these tours are the following:</p><ul>  <li>  <p>Agg\u00e1lavacetiya, Anotatta, Andhakavinda,   Ambap\u00e1livana, Ambalatthik\u00e1, Ambasand\u00e1, Assapura, \u00c1pana, Icch\u00e1nangala, Ukkatth\u00e1   (Subhagavana), Ukk\u00e1cel\u00e1, Ugganagara, Uju\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1 (Kannakatthaka deer-park), Uttara   in Koliya, Uttarak\u00e1, Uttarakuru, Uruvelakappa, Ulumpa, Ekan\u00e1l\u00e1, Opas\u00e1da,   Kakkarapatta, Kajangal\u00e1 (Mukheluvana), Kamm\u00e1ssadhamma, Kalandakaniv\u00e1pa (near   Benares), Kimbil\u00e1, K\u00edt\u00e1giri, Kundadh\u00e1navana (near Kundakoli), Kesaputta,   Kotig\u00e1ma, Kosamb\u00ed (Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma and Badarik\u00e1r\u00e1ma), Kh\u00e1numata, Khomadussa,   Gosingas\u00e1lavana, Candalakappa, Camp\u00e1 (Gaggar\u00e1), C\u00e1tuma, Cetiyagiri in Ves\u00e1li,   J\u00edvakambavana (in R\u00e1jagaha), Tapod\u00e1r\u00e1ma, Tindukkh\u00e1nu (paribb\u00e1jak\u00e1r\u00e1ma),   Todeyya, Thullakotthita, Dakkhin\u00e1giri, Dandakappa, Devadaha, Desaka in the   Sumbha country, Nagaraka, Nagaravinda, N\u00e1dik\u00e1 (Gi\u00f1jak\u00e1vasatha), N\u00e1land\u00e1 (P\u00e1v\u00e1rika   mango-grove), N\u00e1lakap\u00e1na (Pal\u00e1savana), Pankadh\u00e1, Pa\u00f1casal\u00e1, P\u00e1tik\u00e1r\u00e1ma, Beluva,   the Brahma world, Bhaddavat\u00ed, Bhaddiya (J\u00e1tiy\u00e1vana), Bhaganagara (Anandacetiya),   Manin\u00e1lakacetiya, Mana-s\u00e1kata, M\u00e1tul\u00e1, Mithil\u00e1 (Makh\u00e1deva mango-grove),   Medatalumpa, Moraniv\u00e1pa, Rammaka's hermitage, Latthivana, Videha,   Vedha\u00f1\u00f1a-ambavana, Ven\u00e1gapura, Vera\u00f1j\u00e1, Veludv\u00e1ra, Ves\u00e1li (also various   shrines there, Udenacetiya, Gotamacetiya, C\u00e1palacetiya, Bahuputta-kacetiya,   Sattambacetiya, S\u00e1randadacetiya), Sakkara, Sajjanela, Salal\u00e1g\u00e1raka in   S\u00e1vatthi, S\u00e1keta (A\u00f1janavana), S\u00e1mag\u00e1ma, S\u00e1lavatik\u00e1, S\u00e1l\u00e1, Simsap\u00e1vana,   Sil\u00e1vat\u00ed, S\u00edtavana, S\u00fakarakhatalena, Setavy\u00e1, Hatthig\u00e1ma, Halidavassana and   the region of the Him\u00e1laya.</li></ul><p> </p><p>There is a more or less continuous account of the last year of the Buddha's life. This is contained in three suttas: the Mah\u00e1 Parinibb\u00e1na, the Mah\u00e1 Sudassana and the Janavasabha. These are not", "separate discourses but are intimately connected with each other. The only event prior to the incidents recounted in these suttas, which can be fixed with any certainty, is the death of the Buddha's pious patron and supporter, Bimbis\u00e1ra, which took place eight years before the Buddha's Parinibb\u00e1na (Mhv.ii.32). It was at this time that Devadatta tried to obtain for himself a post of supremacy in the Order, and, failing in this effort, became the open enemy of the Buddha. Devadatta's desire to deprive the Buddha of the leadership of the Sangha seems to have been conceived by him, according to the Vinaya account (Vin.ii.184), almost immediately after he joined the Order, and the Buddha was warned of this by the devaputta Kakudha. This account lends point to the statement contained especially in the Northern books, that even in their lay life Devadatta had always been Gotama's rival. </p><p> </p><p>Enlisting the support of Aj\u00e1tasattu, he tried in many ways to kill the Buddha. Royal archers were bribed to shoot the Buddha, but they were won over by his personality and confessed their intentions. Then Devadatta hurled a great rock down Gijjhak\u00fata on to the Buddha as he was walking in the shade of the hill; the hurtling rock was stopped by two peaks, but splinters struck the Buddha's foot and caused blood to flow; he suffered great pain and had to be taken to the Maddakucchi garden, where his injuries were dressed by the physician J\u00edvaka (S.i.27). The monks wished to provide a guard, but the Buddha reminded them that no man had the power to deprive a Tath\u00e1gata of his life.</p><p> </p><p>Devadatta next bribed the royal elephant keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, N\u00e1l\u00e1giri, intoxicated with toddy, on the road along which the Buddha would go, begging for alms. The Buddha was warned of this but disregarded the warning, and when the elephant appeared, Ananda,", "against the strict orders of the Buddha, threw himself in its path, and only by an exercise of iddhi-power, including the folding up of the earth, could the Buddha come ahead of him. As the elephant approached, the Buddha addressed it, pervading it with his boundless love, until it became quite gentle. (This incident, with great wealth of detail, is related in several places - e.g., in J.v.333ff).</p><p> </p><p>These attempts to encompass the Buddha's death having failed, Devadatta, with three others, decides to create a schism in the Order and asks the Buddha that five rules should be laid down, whereby the monks would be compelled to lead a far more austere life than hitherto. When this request is refused, Devadatta persuades five hundred recently ordained monks to leave Ves\u00e1li with him and take up their residence at Gay\u00e1s\u00edsa, where he would set up an organisation similar to that of the Buddha. But, at the Buddha's request, S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na visit the renegade monks; S\u00e1riputta preaches to them and they are persuaded to return. When Devadatta discovers this, he vomits hot blood and lies ill for nine months. When his end approaches, he wishes to see the Buddha, but he dies on the way to Jetavana - whither he is being conveyed in a litter - and is born in Av\u00edci.</p><p> </p><p>From Gijjhak\u00fata, near R\u00e1jagaha, the Buddha starts on his last journey. Just before his departure he is visited by Vass\u00e1k\u00e1ra, and the talk is of the Vajjians; the Buddha preaches to Vass\u00e1k\u00e1ra and the monks on the conditions that lead to prosperity. The Buddha proceeds with a large concourse of monks to Ambalatthik\u00e1 and thence to N\u00e1land\u00e1, where S\u00e1riputta utters his lion-roar (s\u00edhan\u00e1da) regarding his faith in the Buddha. The Buddha then goes to P\u00e1talig\u00e1ma, where he talks to the villagers on the evil consequences of immorality and the advantages of morality. He utters a prophecy", "regarding the future greatness of P\u00e1taliputta and then, leaving by the Gotamadv\u00e1ra, he crosses the river Ganges at Gotamatittha. He proceeds to Kotig\u00e1ma and thence to \u00d1\u00e1tika, where he gives to Ananda the formula of the Dhamm\u00e1d\u00e1sa, whereby the rebirth of disciples could be ascertained. From \u00d1\u00e1tika he goes to Ves\u00e1li, staying in the park of the courtesan Ambap\u00e1li. The following day he accepts a meal from Ambap\u00e1li, refusing a similar offer from the Licchavis; Ambap\u00e1li makes a gift of her park to the Buddha and his monks. The Buddha journeys on to Beluva, where he spends the rainy season, his monks remaining in Ves\u00e1li. At Beluva he falls dangerously ill but, with great determination, fights against his sickness. He tells Ananda that his mission is finished, that when he is dead the Order must maintain itself, taking the Dhamma alone as its refuge, and he concludes by propounding the four subjects of mindfulness (D.ii.100). The next day he begs in Ves\u00e1li and, with Ananda, visits the C\u00e1p\u00e1la-cetiya. There he gives to Ananda the opportunity of asking him to live until the end of the kappa, but Ananda fails to take the hint. Soon afterwards M\u00e1ra visits the Buddha and obtains the assurance that the Buddha's nibb\u00e1na will take place in three months. There is an earthquake, and, in answer to Ananda's questions, the Buddha explains to him the eight causes of earthquakes. This is followed by lists of the eight assemblies, the eight stages of mastery and the eight stages of release. The Buddha then repeats to Ananda his conversation with M\u00e1ra, and Ananda now makes his request to the Buddha to prolong his life, but is told that it is now too late; several opportunities he has had, of which he has failed to avail himself. The monks are assembled in Ves\u00e1li, in the Service Hall, and the Buddha exhorts them to practise the doctrines he has taught, in order that the religious life may last long. He then", "announces his impending death.</p><p> </p><p>According to the Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.549), after the rainy season spent at Beluva, the Buddha goes back to Jetavana, where he is visited by S\u00e1riputta, who is preparing for his own Parinibb\u00e1na at N\u00e1lakag\u00e1ma. From Jetavana the Buddha went to R\u00e1jagaha, where Mah\u00e1-Moggall\u00e1na died. Thence he proceeded to Ukk\u00e1cel\u00e1, where he spoke in praise of the two chief disciples. From Ukk\u00e1cel\u00e1 he proceeded to Ves\u00e1li and thence to Bhandag\u00e1ma. R\u00e1hula, too, predeceased the Buddha (DA.ii.549).</p><p> </p><p>The next day, returning from Ves\u00e1li, he looks round at the city for the last time and goes on to Bhandag\u00e1ma; there he preaches on the four things the comprehension of which destroys rebirth-noble conduct, earnestness in meditation, wisdom and freedom.</p><p> </p><p>He then passes through the villages of Hatthig\u00e1ma, Ambag\u00e1ma and Jambugama, and stays at Bhoganagara at the Ananda-cetiya. There he addresses the monks on the Four Great Authorities (Mah\u00e1pades\u00e1), by reference to which the true doctrine may be determined (Cf. A.ii.167ff). From Bhoganagara the Buddha goes to P\u00e1v\u00e1 and stays in the mango-grove of Cunda, the smith. Cunda serves him with a meal which includes s\u00fakaramaddava. (There is much dispute concerning this word. See Thomas, op. cit., 149, n.3). The Buddha alone partakes of the s\u00fakaramaddava, the remains being buried. This is the Buddha's last meal; sharp sickness arises in him, with flow of blood and violent, deadly pains, but the Buddha controls them and sets out for Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1. On the way he has to sit down at the foot of a tree. Ananda fetches him water to drink from the stream Kakutth\u00e1, over which five hundred carts had just passed; but, through the power of the Buddha, the water is quite clear. Here the Buddha is visited by Pukkusa, the Mallan, who is converted and presents the Buddha with a pair of", "gold-coloured robes. The Buddha puts them on and Ananda notices the marvellous brightness and clearness of the Buddha's body. The Buddha tells him that the body of a Buddha takes on this hue on the night before his Enlightenment and on the night of his passing away, and that he will die that night at Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1. He goes to the K\u00e1kutth\u00e1, bathes and drinks there and rests in a mango-grove. There he instructs Ananda that steps must be taken to dispel any remorse that Cunda may feel regarding the meal he gave to the Buddha.</p><p> </p><p>From Kakutth\u00e1 the Buddha crosses the Hira\u00f1\u00f1avat\u00ed to the Upavattana s\u00e1la-grove in Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1. There Ananda prepares for him a bed with the head to the north. All the trees break forth into blossom and flowers cover the body of the Buddha. Divine mand\u00e1rava-flowers and sandalwood powder fall from the sky, and divine music and singing sound through the air. But the Buddha says that the greater honour to him would be to follow his teachings.</p><p>The gods of the ten thousand world systems assemble to pay their last homage to the Buddha, and Upav\u00e1na, who stands fanning him, is asked to move away as he obstructs their view.</p><p> </p><p>Ananda asks for instruction on several points, including how the funeral rites should be performed; he then goes out and abandons himself to a fit of weeping; the Buddha sends for him, consoles him and speaks his praises. Ananda tries to persuade the Buddha not to die in a mud-and-wattle village, such as is Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1, but the Buddha tells him how it was once the mighty Kus\u00e1vat\u00ed, capital of Mah\u00e1sudassana.</p><p> </p><p>The Mallas of Kusin\u00e1ra are informed that the Buddha will pass away in the third watch of the night, and they come with their families to pay their respects. The ascetic Subhadda comes to see the", "Buddha and is refused admission by Ananda, but the Buddha, overhearing, calls him in and converts him. Several minor rules of discipline are delivered, including the order for the excommunication of Channa. The Buddha finally asks the assembled monks to speak out any doubts they may have. All are silent and Ananda expresses his astonishment, but the Buddha tells him it is natural that the monks should have no doubts. Then, addressing the monks for the last time, he admonishes them in these words: \"Decay is inherent in all component things; work out your salvation with diligence.\" These were the Buddha's last words. Passing backwards and forwards through various stages of trance, he attains Parinibb\u00e1na. There is a great earthquake and terrifying thunder, and the Brahm\u00e1 Sahampati, Sakka king of the gods, Anuruddha and Ananda utter stanzas, each proclaiming the feeling uppermost in his mind. It is the full-moon day of the month of Vis\u00e1kha and the Buddha is in his eightieth year.</p><p> </p><p>The next day Ananda informs the Mallas of Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1 of the Buddha's death, and for seven days they hold a great celebration. On the seventh day, following Ananda's instructions, they prepare the body for cremation, taking it in procession by the eastern gate to the Makutabandhana shrine, thus altering their proposed route, in order to satisfy the wishes of the gods, as communicated to them by Anuruddha. The whole town is covered knee-deep with mand\u00e1rava-flowers, which fall from the sky. When, however, four of the chief Mallas try to light the pyre, their attempt is unsuccessful and they must wait until Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, coming with a company of five hundred monks, has saluted it. The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.603) add that Mah\u00e1 Kassapa greatly desired that the Buddha's feet should rest on his head when he worshipped the pyre. The wish was granted: the feet appeared through the", "pyre, and when Kassapa had worshipped them, the pyre closed together. The pyre burns completely away, leaving no cinders nor soot. Streams of water fall from the sky to extinguish it and the Mallas pour on it scented water. They then place a fence of spears around it and continue their celebrations for seven days. At the end of that period there appear several claimants for the Buddha's relics: Aj\u00e1tasattu, the Licchavis of Ves\u00e1li, the S\u00e1kiyans of Kapilavatthu, the Bulis of Allakappa, the Koliyas of R\u00e1mag\u00e1ma, a brahmin of Vethad\u00edpa and the Mallas of P\u00e1v\u00e1. But the Mallas of Kusin\u00e1r\u00e1 refusing to share the relics with the others, there is danger of war. Then the brahmin Dona counsels concord and divides the relics into eight equal parts for the eight claimants. Dona takes for himself the measuring vessel and the Moriyas of Pipphalivana, who arrive late, carry off the ashes. Th\u00fapas were built over these remains and feasts held in honour of the Buddha. </p><p> </p><p>The concluding passage of the Mah\u00e1-Parinibb\u00e1na Sutta (D.ii.167) states that the Buddha's relics were eight measures, seven of which were honoured in Jambud\u00edpa and the remaining one in the N\u00e1ga realm in R\u00e1mag\u00e1ma. One tooth was in heaven, one in Gandh\u00e1ra, a third in K\u00e1linga (later taken to Ceylon), and a fourth in the N\u00e1ga world. Aj\u00e1tasattu's share was deposited in a th\u00fapa and forgotten. It was later discovered by Asoka (with the help of Sakka) and distributed among his eighty-four thousand monasteries. Asoka also recorded the finding of all the other relics except those deposited in R\u00e1mag\u00e1ma. These were later deposited in the Mah\u00e1cetiya at Anur\u00e1dhapura (Mhv.xxxi.17ff). Other relics are also mentioned, such as the Buddha's collar-bone, his alms bowl, etc. (Mhv.xvii.9ff; Mhv.i.37, etc.).</p><p> </p><p>It is said (E.g., DA.iii.899) that just", "before the Buddha's S\u00e1sana disappears completely from the world, all the relics will gather together at the Mah\u00e1cetiya, and travelling from there to N\u00e1gad\u00edpa and the Ratanacetiya, assemble at the Mah\u00e1bodhi, together with the relics from other parts. There they will reform the Buddha's golden hued body, emitting the six-coloured aura. The body will then catch fire and completely disappear, amid the lamentations of the ten thousand world-systems.</p><p> </p><p>The Ceylon Chronicles (Mhv.i.12ff; Dpv.i.45ff; ii.1ff etc.) record that the Buddha visited the Island on three separate occasions. </p><blockquote>  <p>(The Burmese claim that the Buddha   visited their land and went to the Lohitacandana Vih\u00e1ra, presented by the   brothers Mah\u00e1punna and C\u00falapunna of V\u00e1nijag\u00e1ma (Ind. Antiq.xxii., and   S\u00e1s.36f.). </p></blockquote><p>The first was while he was dwelling at Uruvel\u00e1, awaiting the moment for the conversion of the Tebh\u00e1tika Jatilas, in the ninth month after the Enlightenment, on the full-moon day of Phussa (Dec.-Jan.). He came to the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ga garden, and stood in the air over an assembly of yakkhas then being held. He struck terror into their hearts and, at his suggestion, they left Ceylon and went in a body to Girid\u00edpa, hard by. The Buddha gave a handful of his hair to the deva Mah\u00e1sumana of the Sumanak\u00fata mountain, who built a th\u00fapa which was later enlarged into the Mahiyangana Th\u00fapa. The Buddha again visited Ceylon in the fifth year, on the new-moon day of Citta (March-April), to check an imminent battle between two N\u00e1ga chiefs in N\u00e1gad\u00edpa; the combatants were Mahodara and C\u00falodara, uncle and nephew, and the object of the quarrel was a gem-set throne. The Buddha appeared before them, accompanied by the deva Samiddhi-Sumana, carrying a R\u00e1jayatana tree from Jetavana, settled their quarrel", "and received, as a gift, the throne, the cause of the trouble. He left behind him both the throne and the R\u00e1jayatana tree for the worship of the N\u00e1g\u00e1s and accepted an invitation from the N\u00e1ga king, Maniakkhika of Kaly\u00e1ni, to pay another visit to Ceylon. Three years later Maniakkhika repeated the invitation and the Buddha came to Kaly\u00e1ni with five hundred monks, on the second day of Ves\u00e1kha. Having preached to the N\u00e1gas, he went to Sumanak\u00fata, on the summit of which mountain he left the imprint of his foot (Legend has it that other footprints were left by the Buddha, on the bank of the river Nammad\u00e1, on the Saccabaddha mountain and in Yonakapura). He then stayed at D\u00edghav\u00e1p\u00ed and from there visited Mah\u00e1meghavana, where he consecrated various spots by virtue of his presence, and proceeded to the site of the later Sil\u00e1cetiya. From there he returned to Jetavana.</p><p> </p><p>Very little information as to the personality of the Buddha is available. We are told that he was golden-hued (E.g., Sp.iii.689), that his voice had the eight qualities of the Brahmass\u00e1ra (E.g., D.ii.211; M.ii.166f. It is said that while an ordinary person spoke one word, Ananda could speak eight; but the Buddha could speak sixteen to the eight of Ananda, MA.i.283) - fluency, intelligibility, sweetness, audibility, continuity, distinctness, depth and resonance - that he had a fascinating personality - he was described by his opponents as seductive (E.g., M.i.269, 275) - that he was handsome, perfect alike in complexion and stature and noble of presence (E.g., M.ii.167). He had a unique reputation as a teacher and trainer of the human heart. He was endowed with the thirty-two marks of the Mah\u00e1purisa. (For details of these, see Buddha). There is a legend that Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, though slightly shorter, resembled the Buddha in appearance.</p><p> </p>", "<p>Attempts made, however, to measure the Buddha always failed; two such attempts are generally mentioned - one by a brahmin of R\u00e1jagaha and the other by R\u00e1hu, chief of the Asuras (DA.i.284f). The Buddha had the physical strength of many millions of elephants (e.g., VibhA.397), but his strength quickly ebbed away after his last meal and he had to stop at twenty-five places while travelling three g\u00e1vutas from P\u00e1v\u00e1 to Kusin\u00e1ra (DA.ii.573).</p><p> </p><p>Mention is often made of the Buddha's love of quiet and peace, and even the heretics respected his wishes in this matter, silencing their discussions at his approach (E.g., D.i.178f; iii.39; even his disciples had a similar reputation, e.g., D.iii.37). Examples are given of the Buddha refusing to allow noisy monks to live near him. (E.g., M.i.456; see also M.ii.122, where a monk was jogged by his neighbour because he coughed when the Buddha was speaking). He loved solitude and often spent long periods away from the haunts of men, allowing only one monk to bring him his meals. E.g., S.v.12, 320; but this very love of solitude was sometimes brought against him. By intercourse with whom does he attain to lucidity in wisdom? they asked. His insight, they said, was ruined by his habit of seclusion (D.iii.38).</p><p> </p><p>According to one account (A.i.181), it was his practice to spend part of the day in seclusion, but he was always ready to see anyone who urgently desired his spiritual counsel (E.g., A.iv.438).</p><p> </p><p>In the Mah\u00e1 Govinda Sutta (D.ii.222f ) Sakka is represented as having uttered \"eight true praises\" of the Buddha. Perhaps the most predominant characteristics of the Buddha were his boundless love and his eagerness to help all who sought him. His fondness for children is seen in such stories as those of the two Sop\u00e1kas, of Kum\u00e1ra-Kassapa, of C\u00fala", "Panthaka and Dabba-Mallaputta and also of the novices Pandita and Sukha. His kindness to animals appears, for instance, in the introductory story of the Maccha J\u00e1taka and his interference on behalf of Udena's aged elephant, Bhaddavatik\u00e1 (q.v.). The Buddha was extremely devoted to his disciples and encouraged them in every way in their difficult life. The Therag\u00e1th\u00e1 and the Ther\u00edg\u00e1th\u00e1 are full of stories indicating that he watched, with great care, the spiritual growth and development of his disciples, understood their problems and was ready with timely interference to help them to win their aims. Such incidents as those mentioned in the Bhadd\u00e1li Sutta (M.i.445), the introduction to the Tittha J\u00e1taka and the Ka\u00f1cakkhandha J\u00e1taka, seem to indicate that he took a personal and abiding interest in all who came under him. It was his unvarying custom to greet with a smile all those who visited him, inquiring after their welfare and thus putting them at their ease (Vin.i.313). When anyone sought permission to question him, he made no conditions as to the topic of discussion. This is called sabba\u00f1\u00f1upav\u00e1rana. E.g., M.i.230. When the Buddha himself asked a question of any of his interrogators, they could not remain silent, but were bound to answer; a yakkha called Vajirap\u00e1ni was always present to frighten those who did not wish to do so (e.g., M.i.231). </p><p> </p><p>The Buddha was not over-anxious to get converts, and when his visitors declared themselves his followers he would urge them to take time to consider the matter - e.g., in the case of Acela Kassapa and Up\u00e1ligahapati.</p><p> </p><p>When he was staying in a monastery, he paid daily visits to the sick ward to talk to the inmates and to comfort them (See, e.g., Kut\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1). The charming story of P\u00fatigata-Tissa shows that he sometimes attended on the sick himself, thus setting an example to his", "followers. In return for his devotion, his disciples adored him, but even among those who immediately surrounded him there were a few who refused to obey him implicitly - e.g., L\u00e1lud\u00e1y\u00ed, the companions of Assaji and Punabbasuka, the Chabbaggiyas, the Sattarasavaggiyas and others, not to mention Devadatta and his associates.</p><p>The Buddha seems to have shown a special regard for S\u00e1riputta, Ananda and Mah\u00e1 Kassapa among the monks, and for An\u00e1thapindika, Mallik\u00e1, Visakh\u00e1, Bimbis\u00e1ra and Pasenadi among the laity. He seems to have been secretly amused by the very human qualities of Pasenadi and by his failure to appreciate the real superiority of Mallik\u00e1, his wife.</p><p> </p><p>The Buddha always declared that he was among the happy ones of this earth, that he was far happier, for instance, than Bimbis\u00e1ra (E.g., M.i.94), and he remained unmoved by opposition or abuse. E.g., in the case of the organised conspiracy of M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 (DhA.iv.1f.).</p><p> </p><p>The Milindapa\u00f1ha (p.134) mentions several illnesses of the Buddha: the injury to his foot has already been referred to; once when the humours of his body were disturbed J\u00edvaka administered a purge (Vin.i.279); on another occasion he suffered from some stomach trouble which was cured by hot water, or, according to some, by hot gruel (Vin.i.210f.; Thag.185). The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.232; ThagA.i.311f) mentions another disorder of the humours cured by hot water obtained from the brahmin Devahita, through Upav\u00e1na. The Commentaries mention that he suffered, in his old age, from constant backache, owing to the severe austerities practised by him during the six years preceding his Enlightenment, and the unsuitable meals taken during that period were responsible for a dyspepsia which persisted throughout the rest of his life (SA.i.200),", "culminating in his last serious illness of dysentery. MA.i.465; DA.iii.974; see also D.iii.209, when he was preaching to the Mallas of P\u00e1v\u00e1.</p><p> </p><p>The Apad\u00e1na (Ap.i.299f) contains a set of verses called Pubbakammapiloti; these verses mention certain acts done by the Buddha in the past, which resulted in his having to suffer in various ways in his last birth. He was once a drunkard named Mun\u00e1li and he abused the Pacceka Buddha Surabhi. On another occasion he was a learned brahmin, teacher of five hundred pupils. One day, seeing the Pacceka Buddha Isigana, he spoke ill of him to his pupils, calling him \"sensualist.\" The result of this act was the calumny against him by Sundarik\u00e1 in this life.</p><p> </p><p>In another life he reviled a disciple of a Buddha, named Nanda; for this he suffered in hell for twelve thousand years and, in his last life, was disgraced by Ci\u00f1c\u00e1. Once, greedy for wealth, he killed his step-brothers, hurling them down a precipice; as a result, Devadatta attempted to kill him by hurling down a rock. Once, as a boy, while playing on the highway, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and threw a stone at him, and as a result, was shot at by Devadatta's hired archers. In another life he was a mahout, and seeing a Pacceka Buddha on the road, drove his elephant against him; hence the attack by N\u00e1l\u00e1giri. Once, as a king, he sentenced seventy persons to death, the reward for which he reaped when a splinter pierced his foot. Because once, as a fisherman's son, he took delight in watching fish being caught, he suffered from a grievous headache when Vid\u00fadabha slaughtered the S\u00e1kiyans. In the time of Phussa Buddha he asked the monks to eat barley instead of rice and, as a result, had to eat barley for three months at Vera\u00f1ja. (According to the Dhammapada Commentary [iii.257], the Buddha actually had to starve one day at Pa\u00f1cas\u00e1l\u00e1,", "because none of the inhabitants were willing to give him alms.) Because he once killed a wrestler, he suffered from cramp in the back. Once, when a physician, he caused discomfort to a merchant by purging him, hence his last illness of dysentery. As Jotip\u00e1la, he spoke disparagingly of the Enlightenment of Kassapa Buddha, and in consequence had to spend six years following various paths before becoming the Buddha. He was one of the most short-lived Buddhas, but because of those six years his S\u00e1sana will last longer (Sp.i.190f). </p><p> </p><p>The Buddha was generally addressed by his own disciples as Bhagav\u00e1.

The Buddha often stayed there during his visits to Kosamb\u00ed and numerous incidents are mentioned in the books in connection with the monastery. It was because of a dispute between two monks of the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma, one expert in the Vinaya and one in the Dhamma, that the first schism arose in the Order, driving the Buddha himself to seek quiet in the P\u00e1rileyyaka forest. Vin.i.337f; M.i.320; DhA.i.44ff; the Kosamb\u00ed monks were evidently somewhat peculiar (see Vin.iv.197).</p><p> </p><p>Even at other times the Buddha seems to have sought solitude in this forest during his sojourns at the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma (See, e.g., S.iii.96f). It was here that the Buddha decreed the ukkhepaniyakamma for Channa, who refused to acknowledge and atone for his offences (Vin.ii.21f), and here that he laid down the procedure in that connection to be followed. Devadatta was at Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma when he first conceived the idea of using Aj\u00e1tasattu for his own ends (Vin.ii.184f). The Buddha was there at the time and it is said that the devaputta Kakudha appeared before Mah\u00e1-Moggall\u00e1na to warn him of Devadatta's schemes. The information was reported to the Buddha, who warned Moggall\u00e1na not to pass it on to others. The Buddha then proceeded to tell Moggall\u00e1na of the five kinds of teachers which appear in the world (A.iii.122f). Ananda is several times spoken of as staying in the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma, sometimes with the Buddha, sometimes alone. On one such occasion he asks the Buddha why women should suffer from certain disabilities as compared with men (A.ii.82). And again (A.iii.132f), what are the circumstances which conduce to ease (ph\u00e1suvih\u00e1ra) in the case of monks? Could it be said of a follower of the Buddha that his", "attainments depend on the length of time during which he has observed the Buddha's teachings? Once Ananda visits (A.iv.37f), at her request, a nun living near by reported to be ill and enamoured of him. The mere sight of him causes her recovery, but he preaches to her on the impermanent nature of the body and makes her realise the truth (A.ii.144f). Among those who visit Ananda at the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma and discuss various matters with him are mentioned: Ghosita (S.iv.113), Unn\u00e1bha (S.v.271f.), a householder, follower of the Ajivikas (A.i.217f.), and Bhaddaji (A.iii.202). Ud\u00e1y\u00ed twice visits him there, once to ask for a description of consciousness (S.iv.169f.), and again to quote a verse uttered by Pa\u00f1c\u00e1lacanda devaputta and to ask Ananda to explain it (A.iv.449). We find him also joining in a discussion which ensued on a sermon to the monks by Ananda (A.iv.426f.). Ud\u00e1y\u00ed preached to large audiences at the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma and was evidently appreciated, for we find Ananda reporting it to the Buddha and being told that it is no easy matter to preach to a large assembly with acceptance (A.iii.184f.). The Yuganaddha Sutta is a discourse preached by Ananda to the monks at the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma of his own accord (A.ii.156f.). Channa is several times mentioned in connection with incidents taking place at the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma. Mention has already been made of the ukkhepa-niyakamma declared on him.

On another occasion he is reported to the Buddha for refusing to listen to his colleagues and the Buddha chides him (Vin.iii.77, also iv.35f, 113. See also S.iii.132f). It was when Channa was at the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma that Ananda came, at the", "bidding of the monks, to inflict on him the brahmadanda (Vin.ii.292).</p><p> </p><p>Among others mentioned as staying at the Ghosit\u00e1r\u00e1ma are M\u00fasila, Savittha, N\u00e1rada, in the company of Ananda (S.ii.115), Pindola Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1ja - who converts Udena when the latter comes to see him (S.iv.110f.) and earns the Buddha's praises for his attainments (S.v.224) - S\u00e1riputta and Upav\u00e1na (S.v.76), and B\u00e1hiya and Anuruddha (A.ii.239).

Thus he was the grandson of Vijayab\u00e1hu I and of Tilokasundar\u00ed, and came, therefore, of K\u00e1linga stock. When he saw the increasing power of the Prince Parakkamab\u00e1hu (afterwards Parakkamab\u00e1hu I.), Gajab\u00e1hu sent for him with many marks of favour and welcomed him at his court. In order to win the king's confidence Parakkama gave his sister Bhaddavati to be his queen, but when he saw that Gajab\u00e1hu was becoming suspicious of his power he left Pulatthipura and made preparations to wage war against him. In the campaign that followed, Gajab\u00e1hu suffered many reverses and, in the end, fell into the hands of Parakkama's forces. With great difficulty Parakkama saved him from death, but in the meantime M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana managed to get Gajab\u00e1hu into his power and cast him into a dungeon. From there he was rescued by Parakkamab\u00e1hu and fled to Kotthas\u00e1ra. Meanwhile, Parakkamab\u00e1hu had consolidated his power, and his officers captured Pulatthipura. Gajab\u00e1hu, being able to see no other help, implored the monks of Pulatthipura to intercede on his behalf, and, at their request, Parakkamab\u00e1hu left to Gajab\u00e1hu the enjoyment of his possessions. (This is rather odd, especially in view of the fact that he invited heretical nobles to come to Ceylon, Cv.lxx.53). Gajab\u00e1hu took up his abode at Gang\u00e1tal\u00e1ka and spent his last days there in comparative peace. As he had no heir and no brothers, he bequeathed his kingdom to Parakkamab\u00e1hu, and engraved his will on a stone tablet at Mandalagiri Vih\u00e1ra. He was cremated at Kotthas\u00e1ra. (Details of Gajab\u00e1hu's reign and his fights with Parakkamab\u00e1hu are contained in the C\u00falavamsa, particularly in chapters 63, 66,", "67, 70, 71).

Vanav\u00e1s\u00ed (Vanav\u00e1sika) Tissa. </b>A monk. In his previous birth he was the brahmin Mah\u00e1sena (q.v.). During pregnancy his mother invited S\u00e1riputta with five hundred monks, to her house, and fed them on milk rice. She herself put on yellow robes and ate of the rice left by the monks. On the day of his naming, he presented S\u00e1riputta with his blanket. He was called Tissa after S\u00e1riputta, whose personal name was Upatissa. At the age of seven Tissa joined the Order and his parents held a festival lasting for seven days, distributing porridge and honey to the monks. On the eighth day, when Tissa went for alms in S\u00e1vatthi, he received one thousand bowls of alms and one thousand pieces of cloth, all of which he gave to the monks. This earned for him the name of Pindap\u00e1tad\u00e1yaka. One day, in the cold season, he saw monks warming themselves before fires and, discovering that they had no blankets, he, accompanied by one thousand monks, went into the city. Wherever he went people gave him blankets; one shopkeeper had hidden two of his very costly blankets, but on seeing Tissa he gave them willingly. Tissa thus got one thousand blankets and was thereafter called Kambalad\u00e1yaka.</p><p>Having discovered that, at Jetavana, his young relations came too often to see him, he obtained a formula of meditation and went into the forest to a distance of twenty leagues from S\u00e1vatthi. At the request of the inhabitants of the village near by, he spent the rainy season in the forest hermitage, going into the village for alms. There, at the end of two months, he attained arahantship. Because he was so devoted to the forest, he was given the name of Vanav\u00e1s\u00ed. At the end of the vassa, all the Buddha's chief disciples, with a retinue of forty thousand monks, visited Tissa in his hermitage, arriving", "there in the evening. The villagers, recognizing S\u00e1riputta, asked him to preach the Dhamma, saying that Tissa, their teacher, knew only two sentences   \"May you be happy, may you obtain release from suffering!\"   which sentences he repeated whenever anyone made him a gift. Thereupon S\u00e1riputta asked him to explain the meaning of the two sentences, and the novice preached till sunrise, summarizing the whole of the Buddha's teaching \u201ceven as a thunderstorm rains incessantly upon the four great continents.\"</p><p>At the end of the discourse Tissa's supporters were divided into two camps, some were offended that he should not have preached to them before, while others marvelled at his saintliness and skill. The Buddha, aware of this disagreement, went himself to the village. The villagers gave alms to the Buddha and the monks, and, in returning thanks, the Buddha told them how fortunate they were that, owing to Tissa, they had been able to see himself and his chief disciples. They were then all satisfied.</p><p>On the way back to S\u00e1vatthi, Tissa walked beside the Buddha and pointed out to him the various beautiful spots. The Buddha preached the Upas\u00e1lhaka J\u00e1taka to show that there was no spot on earth where men had not at some time died. In answer to a question of the Buddha, Tissa said that he never felt afraid of the animals in the forest, but only a greater love for the forest at the sound of their voices. He then recited fifty stanzas in praise of life in the wilds. Arrived at the outskirts of the forest, he took leave of the Buddha and S\u00e1riputta and returned to live in his forest hermitage. DhA.ii.84-102. The visit of Buddha is also reported at DA.i.240 and MA.i.357, though the details are the different.

Sa\u00f1jaya put honey on the grass where the animal fed, and, in due course, the animal came to eat out of his hand.

Vakkali Thera. </b>He belonged to a brahmin family of S\u00e1vatthi and became proficient in the three Vedas. After he once saw the Buddha he could never tire of looking at him, and followed him about. In order to be closer to him he became a monk, and spent all his time, apart from meals and bathing, in contemplating the Buddha's person. One day the Buddha said to him, \"The sight of my foul body is useless; he who sees the Dhamma, he it is that seeth me\" (yo kho dhammam passati so mam passati; yo mam passati so dhammam passati) (Cp. Itv. sec. 92). But even then Vakkali would not leave the Buddha till, on the last day of the rains, the Buddha commanded him to depart. Greatly grieved, Vakkali sought the precipices of Gijjhak\u00fata. The Buddha, aware of this, appeared before him and uttered a stanza; then stretching out his hand, he said: \"Come, monk.\" Filled with joy, Vakkali rose in the air pondering on the Buddha's words and realized arahantship. AA.i.140f.; the Apad\u00e1na account (Ap.ii.465f.) is similar. It says that the Buddha spoke to him from the foot of the rock. Vakkali jumped down to meet the Buddha, a depth of many cubits, but he alighted unhurt. It was on this occasion that the Buddha declared his eminence among those of implicit faith; also DhA.iv.118f. The DhA. reports three verses uttered by the Buddha in which he assures Vakkali that he will help him and look after him.</p><p>According to the Therag\u00e1th\u00e1, Commentary (ThagA.i.420), when Vakkali was dismissed by the Buddha he lived on Gijjhak\u00fata, practising meditation, but could not attain insight because of his emotional nature (saddh\u00e1). The Buddha then gave him a special exercise, but neither could he achieve this, and, from lack of food, he suffered from cramp. The Buddha visited", "him and uttered a verse to encourage him. Vakkali spoke four verses (Thag.350 4) in reply, and, conjuring up insight, won arahantship. Later, in the assembly of the monks, the Buddha declared him foremost among those of implicit faith (saddh\u00e1dhimutt\u00e1nam) (cp. A.i.25; also Dvy.49 and VibhA.276; Vsm.i.129). In the P\u00e1r\u00e1yanavagga (SN. vs. 1146) the Buddha is represented as holding Vakkali up to Pingiya as an example of one who won emancipation through faith.</p><p>The Samyutta account (S.iii.119ff.; SA.ii.229) gives more details and differs in some respects from the above. There, Vakkali fell ill while on his way to visit the Buddha at R\u00e1jagaha, and was carried in a litter to a potter's shed in R\u00e1jagaha. There, at his request, the Buddha visited him and comforted him. He questioned Vakkali, who assured him that he had no cause to reprove himself with regard to morals (s\u00edlato); his only worry was that he had not been able to see the Buddha earlier. The Buddha told him that seeing the Dhamma was equivalent to seeing him, and because Vakkali had realized the Dhamma, there would be no hereafter for him. After the Buddha had left, Vakkali asked his attendants to take him to K\u00e1lasil\u00e1 on Isigili. The Buddha was on Gijjhak\u00fata and was told by two devas that Vakkali was about to \"obtain release.\" The Buddha sent word to him: \"Fear not, Vakkali, your dying will not be evil.\" Vakkali rose from his bed to receive the Buddha's message, and sending word to the Buddha that he had no desire or love for the body or the other khandhas, he drew a knife and killed himself. The Buddha went to see his body, and declared that he had obtained Nibb\u00e1na and that M\u00e1ra's attempt to find the consciousness of Vakkali would prove useless.</p><p>The Commentary adds that Vakkali was conceited and blind to his remaining faults. He thought he was a kh\u00edn\u00e1sava, and that he might rid", "himself of bodily pains by death. However, the stab with the knife caused him such pain that at the moment of dying he realized his puthujjana state, and, putting forth great effort, attained arahantship.</p><p>His resolve to become chief among the saddh\u00e1dhimuttas had been made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he saw a monk also named Vakkali similarly honoured by the Buddha.

Later the Buddha declared him foremost among those pre eminent in ready expression (patibh\u00e1navant\u00e1nam). His resolve to attain to this position was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.

S.i.185; on one such occasion, he confessed his disaffection to Ananda, who admonished him.); others (1219-22) were self admonitions against conceit because of his facility of speech; some were spoken in praise of sermons preached by the Buddha -  e.g., the Subh\u00e1sita Sutta (1227-30), a sutta on Nibb\u00e1na (1238-45), and a sutta preached at the Pav\u00e1rana ceremony (1231-7).

It was a remark made by the Nigantha Giri to Vattag\u00e1main\u00ed, as he fled from the battle, that led later to the establishment of Abhayagiri (q.v.). The king hid in the forest in Vessagiri and was rescued by Kupikkala Mah\u00e1tissa, who gave him over to the care of Tanas\u00edva.

The Buddha tells him to proceed to the study of calm and insight, whereby sixfold abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1 may be acquired. Vacchagotta profits by the lesson and soon after becomes an arahant.

K\u00e1kavannatissa heard of this and summoned him to the court. The village irrigated by the tank was given to him, and it came to be called Vasabhodakav\u00e1ra. Mhv.xxiii.90ff.</p><hr><p><b>7.

The Buddha said that as long as the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of prosperity which he had taught them at S\u00e1randada cetiya, they would prosper rather than decline, and this gave Vassak\u00e1ra the idea that the downfall of the Vajjians could be brought about by diplomacy (upal\u00e1pana) or disunion (mithubheda). He thereupon conspired with the king (D.A.ii.522ff ) and, by agreement, the latter expelled him on the charge of showing favour to the Vajjians during discussions in the assembly. Vassak\u00e1ra then went to the Vajjian country, and the Licchavis, all unsuspecting, welcomed him and appointed him as the teacher of their children. By means of cunning and questioning the children in secret, he made them quarrel with each other, and these quarrels soon spread to the elders. In three years the Licchavis were completely disunited, and when the assembly drum was beaten, they failed to appear.

Having asked the subject of conversation, he inquired whether the Buddha himself or the Order had chosen a leader for the Sangha after the Buddha's death. Ananda explains that the Buddha did not do so, that no special leader has been appointed, but that there were monks to whom they showed honour and reverence because of their virtue and insight. Vassak\u00e1ra admits this as good, as does also Upananda, the Sen\u00e1pati, who is present.

Vassak\u00e1ra thinks this a good place for the practice of jh\u00e1na, and tells Ananda of a conversation he once had with the Buddha regarding jh\u00e1na.

The Buddha, hearing of this, said that, unless Vassak\u00e1ra begged the Elder's forgiveness, he would be born as a monkey in Veluvana. Vassak\u00e1ra, feeling sure that the Buddha's prophecy would come true, had various fruit and other trees planted in Veluvana, to be of use to him as a monkey. After death he was actually reborn as a monkey and answered to the name of Vassak\u00e1ra.</p><p>Three conversations between the Buddha and Vassak\u00e1ra are recorded in the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya, all three taking place at Veluvana.

The page was bribed to change the live cocks for dead ones on the way, and S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed and her companions then cooked them and sent them to the Buddha. But even then the king, though not knowing of the exchange, would not be convinced of S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed's disloyalty.</p><p>M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 then obtained a snake from her uncle with its fangs removed. This she inserted in the shell of the flute which Udena carried about, closing the hole with a bunch of flowers. Udena was in the habit of spending a week in turn with each of his three consorts. When he announced his intention of going to S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed, M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 begged of him not to go, saying she had had a dream and feared for his safety. But the king went and M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 went with him. As he lay asleep with the lute under his pillow she pulled out the bunch of flowers, and the snake lay coiled on his pillow. M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 screamed and accused S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed of designs on the king's life. This time Udena believed her, and placing S\u00e1m\u00e1vati and her friends in a line one behind the other, he sent for his bow, which could only be strung by one thousand men, and shot an arrow at S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed's breast. But by the power of her goodness the arrow failed to pierce her. Convinced of her innocence, the king pleaded for her forgiveness and gave her a boon. She chose that the Buddha should be invited to come to the palace every day, but the Buddha would not accept the invitation and sent Ananda in his place.</p><p>Once more M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 conspired with her uncle against S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed. They had all the pillars of S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed's house wrapt in cloth, soaked in oil, and, when she and her women were inside, the house was set fire to. S\u00e1m\u00e1vat\u00ed saw the flames spreading and exhorted her women to be self possessed, and they attained to various fruits of the Path. Udena questioned M\u00e1gandiy\u00e1 very", "carefully, and became convinced of her share and that of her uncle in the crime. He then sent for all M\u00e1gandiya's relations saying that he wished to reward them. He buried them waist-deep in the palace grounds and covered them with straw; the straw was then set fire to, and when it was burnt he had their bodies ploughed with an iron plough.

One day, when Ditthamangalik\u00e1, the daughter of a rich merchant, was on her way to the park with a group of friends, she saw M\u00e1tanga coming towards the city, and thinking the sight inauspicious, washed her eyes with perfumed water and turned back home. Her companions, annoyed at being deprived of their fun, beat M\u00e1tanga and left him senseless. On recovering consciousness, he determined to get Ditthamangalik\u00e1 as wife and lay down outside her father's house refusing to move. Seven days he lay thus until her relations, fearing the ignominy of having a cand\u00e1la die at their door, gave Ditthamangalik\u00e1 to him as wife.</p><p>Knowing her pride to be quelled by this act, M\u00e1tanga decided to bring her great honour. He, therefore, retired into the forest and in seven days, won supernatural power. On his return he told her to proclaim abroad that her husband was not a cand\u00e1la but Mah\u00e1brahm\u00e1, and that seven days later, on the night of the full moon, he would come to her, breaking through the moon's disk. She did as he said and so it happened. The people thenceforth honoured her as a goddess; the water in which she washed her feet was used for the coronation of kings, and in one single day she received eighteen crores from those who were allowed the privilege of saluting her. M\u00e1tanga touched her navel with his thumb, and, knowing that she had conceived a son, admonished her to be vigilant and returned to the moon.</p><p>The son was born in the pavilion, which the people had constructed for the use of Ditthamangalik\u00e1, and was therefore called Mandavya,. At the age of sixteen he knew all the Vedas and fed sixteen thousand brahmins daily. On a feast day M\u00e1tanga came to him, thinking to turn him from his wrong", "doctrines, but Mandavya failed to recognize him and had him cast out by his servants, Bhandakucchi, Upajjh\u00e1ya, and Upajotiya. The gods of the city thereupon grew angry and twisted the necks of Mandavya and all the brahmins so that their eyes looked over their shoulders. When Ditthamangalik\u00e1 heard of this she sought M\u00e1tanga, who had left his footsteps so that she might know where he was. He asked her to sprinkle on the brahmins water in which were dissolved the leavings of his food; to Mandavya himself was given some of the food. On recovering and seeing the plight of the brahmins, he realized his error. The brahmins recovered, but were shunned by their colleagues; they left the country and went to live in the kingdom of Mejjha.</p><p>On the bank of the Vettavat\u00ed lived a brahmin called J\u00e1timanta, very proud of his birth. M\u00e1tanga went thither to humble the pride of J\u00e1timanta and lived higher up stream. One day he nibbled a tooth stick and threw it into the river, where, lower down, it got entangled in J\u00e1timanta's hair. He was greatly annoyed and went up stream, where he found M\u00e1tanga and told him that, if he stayed there any longer, at the end of seven days his head would split into seven pieces. On the seventh day M\u00e1tanga stopped the sun from rising. On discovering the cause, the people dragged J\u00e1timanta to M\u00e1tanga and made him ask forgiveness, falling at M\u00e1tanga's feet. J\u00e1timanta's head was covered with a lump of clay, which was immersed in the water as the sun rose.</p><p>M\u00e1tanga then went to the kingdom of Mejjha, where the exiled brahmins reported against him to the king, saying that he was a juggler and a mountebank. The king's messengers surprised M\u00e1tanga as he was eating his food beside a well, and cut off his head. He was born in the Brahma world.

The king found her sagacious and practical minded and consulted her and accepted her advice when in difficulty -  e.g., in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana')\">Asadisa</a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana')\">-d\u00e1na</a>, wherein he wished to excel his subjects, and again when he was troubled by evil dreams as narrated", "in the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasupina_jat_077')\">Mah\u00e1sup\u00edna J\u00e1taka</a>. DhA.ii.8ff. says that Mallik\u00e1 called the king a simpleton for putting his faith in brahmins and took him to the Buddha, and while the king sat trembling, asked the questions for him and had them explained. </p><p>The J\u00e1taka states how Mallik\u00e1 saved many innocent lives from being sacrificed, and the Buddha declared that in a past life too, as Dinn\u00e1 (q.v.), she had saved the lives of a large number of people by her wisdom (DhA.ii.15f).</p><p>Both Mallik\u00e1 and Pasenadi's other queen, <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa')\">V\u00e1sabhakhattiy\u00e1</a>, desired to learn the Dhamma, and, at their request conveyed through Pasenadi, the Buddha asked Ananda to visit the palace regularly and teach them the Doctrine. Ananda found in Mallik\u00e1 an apt and ready pupil, conscientious in her work; V\u00e1sabhakhattiy\u00e1 was not so devoted to her duties. DhA.i.382f.   For an incident connected with Ananda's visit to the palace, see Vin.iv.158f.</p><p>Mallika's knowledge of the Dhamma made her wiser than Pasenadi would have desired, and he once, in a moment of great affection, asked if anyone were dearer to her than her own \"self.\" \"No, Sire,\" was the answer; the king was evidently greatly disappointed, for he sought the Buddha, who explained to him that Mallik\u00e1, in making that answer, had uttered a great truth (S.i.75; Ud.v.1). Mallik\u00e1, though an exemplary wife, was not without lapses. Reference is made to the quarrels she had with her husband, once, at least, on the question of conjugal rights, as a result of which they both sulked and had to be reconciled by the Buddha. J.iv.437; also J.iii.20; in these quarrels the king was probably more to blame than Mallik\u00e1; it is said that until reconciled by the Buddha he ignored her very existence, saying that prosperity had turned", "her head. </p><p>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.119ff) relates a ridiculous story about her misbehaviour with a dog in the bath house. Pasenadi was a witness of this scene, but she was able to convince him that it was the fault of the lighting of the bath house. Nevertheless, it is said that at the moment of her death she recollected this misdeed, and, as a result, was reborn in <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aviici')\">Av\u00edci</a>. The king was overcome by grief at Mallika's death, and, after the funeral rites, went to the Buddha to ask where she had been reborn. The Buddha, not wishing him to know, caused the king to forget the question, every time he came to the vih\u00e1ra, for a whole week, till Mallik\u00e1's suffering in Av\u00edci was over; then he allowed the question to be asked, and he was able to assure Pasenadi that she had been reborn in <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/t/tusita')\">Tusita</a> and to console him in his grief. It is said (A.iii.57) that Pasenadi was on a visit to the Buddha when a man came with the whispered message that the queen was dead. It was a terrible shock, \"his shoulders drooped, his mouth fell, and he sat brooding, unable to speak.\"</p><p>Mallik\u00e1 had a daughter by Pasenadi; no mention is made of a son. Probably <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajiraakumaarii')\">Vaj\u00edr\u00ed</a>, who is spoken of as the king's only daughter (M.ii.110). He is said to have been disappointed on hearing that the child was a girl; but the Buddha assured him that women were sometimes wiser than men (S.i.86f).</p><p>Mallik\u00e1 is mentioned (Mil. 115, 291) as one of seven persons whose acts of devotion bore fruit in this life and whose fame reached even to the gods. Only one instance is on record of Mallik\u00e1 asking a question of the Buddha. She wished to know why some women are plain, others beautiful, some rich, and others poor. And the Buddha explained to her the reasons for these", "discrepancies (See <a href=\"mallikaa_s')\">Mallik\u00e1 Sutta 1</a>).</p><p>In the <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/pu/piyajatika_sutta')\">Piyaj\u00e1tika Sutta</a> (M.ii.106ff ) Pasenadi is said to have taunted her because \"her recluse Gotama\" had said that dear ones bring sorrow and tribulation. \"If the Lord says so, it must be so,\" she replies; but secretly sends N\u00e1lijangha to find out from the Buddha himself if he had said so and why. Having learnt the facts, she faces Pasenadi again, and convinced him too that the Buddha is right.</p><p>Mallik\u00e1 had a garden, called the Mallik\u00e1r\u00e1ma, in which was a Hall among the Deispyros trees (tinduk\u00e1c\u00edra) set apart for religious discussions between members of various sects (samayappav\u00e1daka).

Magadha formed one of the sixteen Mah\u00e1janapadas and had its capital at R\u00e1jagaha or Giribbaja where Bimbis\u00e1ra, and after him Aj\u00e1tasattu, reigned. Later, P\u00e1taliputta became the capital. By the time of Bimbis\u00e1ra, Anga, too, formed a part of Magadha, and he was known as king of Anga Magadha (see, e.g., Vin.i.27 and ThagA.i.544, where Bimbis\u00e1ra sends for Sona Kolivisa, a prominent citizen of Camp\u00e1, capital of Anga). But prior to that, these were two separate kingdoms, often at war with each other (e.g., J.iv.454f). Several kings of Magadha are mentioned by name in the J\u00e1takas -  e.g., Arindama and Duyyodhana. In one story (J.vi.272) the Magadha kingdom is said to have been under the suzerainty of Anga. In the Buddha's day, Magadha (inclusive of Anga) consisted of eighty thousand villages (Vin.i.179) and had a circumference of some three hundred leagues (DA.i.148).</p><p>Aj\u00e1tasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books (e.g., D.ii.73f., 86).</p><p>Under Bimbis\u00e1ra and Aj\u00e1tasattu, Magadha rose to such political eminence that for several centuries, right down to the time of Asoka, the history of Northern India was practically the history of Magadha. (A list of the kings from Bimbis\u00e1ra to Asoka is found in Dvy.369 ; cp. DA.i.153; Mbv.96, 98).</p><p> </p><p>At the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Magadha was bounded on the east by the river Camp\u00e1 (Camp\u00e1 flowed between Anga and Magadha; J.iv.454), on the south by the Vindhy\u00e1 Mountains, on the west by the river Sona,", "and on the north by the Ganges. The latter river formed the boundary between Magadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the M\u00e1gadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river. When the Buddha visited Ves\u00e1li, Bimbis\u00e1ra made a road five leagues long, from R\u00e1jagaha to the river, and decorated it, and the Licchavis did the same on the other side. DhA.iii.439 f.; the Dvy. (1p.55) says that monks going from S\u00e1vatthi to R\u00e1jagaha could cross the Ganges in boats kept either by Aj\u00e1tasattu or by the Licchavis of Ves\u00e1li.</p><p>During the early Buddhist period Magadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning. The kings of Magadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbis\u00e1ra and Pasenadi marrying each other's sisters. Mention is made of an alliance between Pukkus\u00e1ti, king of Gandh\u00e1ra and Bimbis\u00e1ra. When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbis\u00e1ra sent him his own personal physician, J\u00edvaka.</p><p> </p><p>In Magadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampat\u00ed in Vin.i.5, p\u00e1tur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo, etc.), and it was from Magadha that it spread after the Third Council. The Buddha's chief disciples, S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na, came from Magadha. In Asoka's time the income from the four gates of his capital of P\u00e1taliputta was four hundred thousand kah\u00e1panas daily, and in the Sabh\u00e1, or Council, he would daily receive another hundred thousand kah\u00e1panas (Sp.i.52). The cornfields of Magadha were rich and fertile (Thag.vs.208), and each Magadha field was about one g\u00e1vuta in extent. Thus AA.ii.616 explains the extent of Kakudha's body, which filled two or three M\u00e1gadha village fields (A.iii.122).</p><p>The names of several places in Magadha occur in the books", "-  e.g., Ekan\u00e1l\u00e1, N\u00e1Iakag\u00e1ma, Sen\u00e1nig\u00e1ma, Kh\u00e1numata, Andhakavindha, Macala, M\u00e1tul\u00e1, Ambalatthik\u00e1, P\u00e1talig\u00e1ma, N\u00e1Iand\u00e1 and S\u00e1Iindiya.</p><p>Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.135 f ) that there are many fanciful explanations (bahudh\u00e1 papa\u00f1canti) of the word Magadha. One such is that king Cetiya, when about to be swallowed up by the earth for having introduced lying into the world, was thus admonished by those standing round -  \"M\u00e1 gadham pavisa;\u201d another that those who were digging in the earth saw the king, and that he said to them: \" M\u00e1 gadham karotha.\" The real explanation, accepted by Buddhaghosa himself, seems to have been that the country was the residence of a tribe of khattiyas called Magadh\u00e1.</p><p> </p><p>The Magadhabh\u00e1s\u00e1 is regarded as the speech of the \u00c1riyans (e.g., Sp.i.255). If children grow up without being taught any language, they will spontaneously use the Magadha language; it is spread all over Niraya, among lower animals, petas, humans and devas (VibhA.387f).</p><p> </p><p>The people of Anga and Magadha were in the habit of holding a great annual sacrifice to M\u00e1ha Brahm\u00e1 in which a fire was kindled with sixty cartloads of firewood. They held the view that anything cast into the sacrificial fire would bring a thousand fold reward. SA.i.269; but it is curious that in Vedic, Br\u00e1hmana and S\u00fatra periods, Magadha was considered as outside the pale of Ariyan and Brahmanical culture, and was therefore looked down upon by Brahmanical writers. But it was the holy land of the Buddhists. See VT.ii.207; Thomas: op. cit., 13, 96.</p><p>Magadha was famous for a special kind of garlic (Sp.iv.920) and the Magadha n\u00e1la was a standard of measure. (E.g., AA.i.101).</p><p>Magadha is identified with the modern South Behar.

The last quotation seems to indicate that the four M\u00e1ras are the five M\u00e1ras less Devaputta M\u00e1ra.</p><p>A few particulars are available about Devaputta M\u00e1ra: M\u00e1ro ti Vasavattibh\u00famiyam a\u00f1\u00f1ataro d\u00e1marikadevaputto.

The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean \"the world under the sway of death\" (also called M\u00e1radheyya -", "e.g., A.iv.228) and the beings therein. Thence, the kilesas also came to be called M\u00e1ra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the kilesas were likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a devaputta of the Vasavatti world, called M\u00e1ra, who considered himself the head of the K\u00e1m\u00e1vacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.</p><p>Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with M\u00e1ra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the kilesas, and the world over which Death and the kilesas hold sway. Thus: Those who can restrain the mind and check its propensities can escape the snares of M\u00e1ra (Dhp. Yamaka, vs. 7). He who delights in objects cognizant to the eye, etc., has gone under M\u00e1ra's sway (S.iv.91). He who has attachment is entangled by M\u00e1ra (S.iii.73). M\u00e1ra will overthrow him who is unrestrained in his senses, immoderate in his food, idle and weak (Dhp. Yamaka, vs. 8). By attaining the Noble Eightfold Path one can be free from M\u00e1ra (Dhp. vs. 40). The Samyutta (i. 135) records a conversation between M\u00e1ra and Vajir\u00e1. She has attained arahantship, and tells M\u00e1ra: \"There is no satta here who can come under your control; there is no being but a mere heap of sankh\u00e1ras (suddhasankh\u00e1rarapu\u00f1ja).</p><p>The later books, especially the Nid\u00e1nakath\u00e1 of the J\u00e1taka Commentary (J.i.71ff.; cp. MA.i.384) and the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p. 239f), contain a very lively and detailed description of the temptation of the Buddha by M\u00e1ra, as the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree immediately before his", "Enlightenment. These accounts describe how M\u00e1ra, the devaputta, seeing the Bodhisatta seated, with the firm resolve, of becoming a Buddha, summoned all his forces and advanced against him. These forces extended to a distance of twelve yojanas to the front of the Bodhisatta, twelve to the back, and nine each to the right and to the left. M\u00e1ra himself, thousand armed, rode on his elephant, Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height. His followers assumed various fearsome shapes and were armed with dreadful weapons. At M\u00e1ra's approach, all the various Devas, N\u00e1gas and others, who were gathered round the Bodhisatta singing his praises and paying him homage, disappeared in headlong flight. The Bodhisatta was left alone, and he called to his assistance the ten p\u00e1rami which he had practiced to perfection.</p><p>M\u00e1ra's army is described as being tenfold, and each division of the army is described, in very late accounts (especially in Singhalese books), with great wealth of detail. Each division was faced by the Buddha with one p\u00e1ram\u00ed and was put to flight. M\u00e1ra's last weapon was the Cakk\u00e1vudha (q.v.). But when he hurled it at the Buddha it stood over him like a canopy of flowers. Still undaunted, M\u00e1ra challenged the Buddha to show that the seat on which he sat was his by right. M\u00e1ra's followers all shouted their evidence that the seat was M\u00e1ra's. The Buddha, having no other witness, asked the Earth to bear testimony on his behalf, and the Earth roared in response. M\u00e1ra and his followers fled in utter rout, and the Devas and others gathered round the Buddha to celebrate his victory. The sun set on the defeat of M\u00e1ra. This, in brief, is the account of the Buddha's conquest of M\u00e1ra, greatly elaborated in later chronicler, and illustrated in countless Buddhist shrines and temples with all the wealth of riotous color and fanciful imagery that", "gifted artists could command.</p><p>That this account of the Buddha's struggle with M\u00e1ra is literally true, none but the most ignorant of the Buddhists believe, even at the present day. The Buddhist point of view has been well expressed by Rhys Davids (Article on Buddha in the Ency. Brit.). We are to understand by the attack of M\u00e1ra's forces, that all the Buddha's \"old temptations came back upon him with renewed force. For years he had looked at all earthly good through the medium of a philosophy which had taught him that it, without exception, carried within itself the seeds of bitterness and was altogether worthless and impermanent; but now, to his wavering faith, the sweet delights of home and love, the charms of wealth and power, began to show themselves in a different light and glow again with attractive colors. He doubted and agonized in his doubt, but as the sun set, the religious side of his nature had won the victory and seems to have come out even purified from the struggle.\" There is no need to ask, as does Thomas, with apparently great suspicion (Thomas, op. cit., 230), whether we can assume that the elaborators of the M\u00e1ra story were recording \"a subjective experience under the form of an objective reality,\" and did they know or think that this was the real psychological experience which the Buddha went through? The living traditions of the Buddhist countries supply the adequate answer, without the aid of the rationalists. The epic nature of the subject gave ample scope for the elaboration so dear to the hearts of the P\u00e1li rhapsodists.</p><p>The similar story among Jains, as recorded in their commentarial works -  e.g., in the Uttar\u00e1dhyayana S\u00fatra (ZDMG. vol. 49 (1915), 321ff )   bears no close parallelism to the Buddhist account, but only a faint resemblance.</p><p>There is no doubt that the M\u00e1ra legend had its origin in", "the Padh\u00e1na Sutta (q.v.). There M\u00e1ra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nera\u00f1jar\u00e1, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to M\u00e1ra's army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others. \"Seeing this army on all sides,\" says the Buddha, \"I go forth to meet M\u00e1ra with his equipage (sav\u00e1hanam). He shall not make me yield ground. That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.\" Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.</p><p>The second part of the Padh\u00e1na Sutta (SN. vs. 446f.; cf. S.i.122) is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama, and this the Commentary (SNA.ii.391) definitely tells us. After M\u00e1ra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, \"like a crow attacking a rock,\" he left Gotama in disgust. \"The lute of M\u00e1ra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence.\" This lute, according to the Commentary (SNA.ii.394), was picked up by Sakka and given to Pa\u00f1casikha. Of this part of the sutta, more anon.</p><p>The Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya (S.i.124f.; given also at Lal. 490 (378); cp. A.v.46; see also DhA.iii.195f ) also contains a sutta (\"Dh\u00edtaro\"", "Sutta) in which three daughters of M\u00e1ra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment. Their names are Tanh\u00e1, Arati and Rag\u00e1, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in M\u00e1ra's army, as given in the Padh\u00e1na Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.</p><p>Once M\u00e1ra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and M\u00e1ra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans. Thus the books mention various occasions on which M\u00e1ra appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.</p><p>Soon after the Buddha's first vassa, M\u00e1ra approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by M\u00e1ra's fetters. But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine (Vin.i.22). On another occasion M\u00e1ra entered into the body of Vetambar\u00ed and made him utter heretical doctrines. (S.i.67; cp. DhA.iv.141, where M\u00e1ra asks the Buddha about the further shore. In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.326) M\u00e1ra is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants, of the Brahma world). The M\u00e1ra Samyutta (S.i.103ff ) contains several instances of M\u00e1ra's temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhak\u00fata fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his", "hearers (E.g., at Ekasal\u00e1; cf. Nigrodha and his fellow Paribb\u00e1jakas, D.iii.58). Once, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks, M\u00e1ra came in the guise of a bullock and broke their bowls, which were standing in the air to dry; on another occasion he made a great din so that the minds of the listening monks were distracted. Again, when the Buddha went for alms to Pa\u00f1cas\u00e1l\u00e1, he entered into the brahmin householders and the Buddha had to return with empty bowl. M\u00e1ra approached the Buddha on his return and tried to persuade him to try once more; this was, says the Commentary, a ruse, that he might inspire insult and injury in addition to neglect. But the Buddha refused, saying that he would live that day on p\u00edti, like the Abhassara gods. The incident is related at length in SA.i.140f. and DhA.iii.257f.; the Commentaries (e.g., Sp.i.178f.) state that the difficulty experienced by the Buddha and his monks in obtaining food at Vera\u00f1ja (q.v.) was also due to the machinations of M\u00e1ra.</p><p>Again, as the Buddha was preaching to the monks on Nibb\u00e1na, M\u00e1ra came in the form of a peasant and interrupted the sermon to ask if anyone had seen his oxen. His desire was to make the cares of the present life break in on the calm and supramundane atmosphere of the discourse on Nibb\u00e1na. On another occasion he tempted the Buddha with the fascination of exercising power that he might rescue those suffering from the cruelty of rulers. Once, at the S\u00e1kyan village of S\u00edlavat\u00ed, he approached the monks who were bent on study, in the shape of a very old and holy brahmin, and asked them not to abandon the things of this life, in order to run after matters involving time. In the same village, he tried to frighten Samiddhi away from his meditations. Samiddhi sought the Buddha's help and went back and won arahantship. (Cp. the story of Nandiya Thera. Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.864) that when S\u00farambattha, after", "listening to a sermon of the Buddha, had returned home, M\u00e1ra visited him there in the guise of the Buddha and told him that what he (the Buddha) had preached to him earlier was false. S\u00farambattha, though surprised, could not be shaken in his faith, being a sot\u00e1panna). M\u00e1ra influenced Godhika to commit suicide and tried to frighten R\u00e1hula in the guise of a huge elephant. (DhA.iv.69f ). In the account of Godhika's suicide (S.i.122) there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, M\u00e1ra went about looking for his (Godhika's) consciousness (patisandhicitta), and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, \"going about like a cloud of smoke.\" Later, M\u00e1ra came to the Buddha, like a little child (khuddad\u00e1rakavann\u00ed), (SA.i.145) holding a vilva lyre of golden color, and he questioned the Buddha about Godhika. (This probably refers to some dispute which arose among the monks regarding Godhika's destiny.)</p><p>The books mention many occasions on which M\u00e1ra assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhun\u00eds, often in lonely spots -  e.g., \u00c1lavik\u00e1, Kis\u00e1gotam\u00ed, Som\u00e1, Vijay\u00e1, Uppalavantn\u00e1, C\u00e1l\u00e1, Upac\u00e1l\u00e1, Sis\u00fapac\u00e1l\u00e1, Sel\u00e1, Vajir\u00e1 and Khem\u00e1. To the same category of temptations belongs a story found in late commentaries (J.i.63): when Gotama was leaving his palace on his journey of Renunciation, M\u00e1ra, here called Vasavatt\u00ed, appeared before him and promised him the kingdom and the whole world within seven days if he would but turn back. M\u00e1ra's temptations were not confined to monks and nuns; he tempted also lay men and women and tried to lure them from the path of goodness - e.g., in the story of Dhaniya and his wife. (SNA.i.44; see also J.i.231f).</p><p>Mention is made, especially in the Mah\u00e1 Parinibb\u00e1na Sutta, of several occasions on which M\u00e1ra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvel\u00e1, soon", "after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the s\u00e1sana was firmly established. Can it be that here we have the word M\u00e1ra used in the sense of physical death (Maccum\u00e1ra), and that the occasions referred to were those on which the Buddha felt the desire to die, to pass away utterly, to \"lay down the burden\"? Perhaps they were moments of physical fatigue, when he lay at death's door, for we know (see Gotama) that the six years he spent in austerities made inroads on his health and that he suffered constantly from muscular cramp, digestive disorders and headache. (It is true that in the Mah\u00e1saccaka Sutta (M.i.240ff.), which contains an account of the events leading up to the Enlightenment, there is no mention whatsoever of any temptation by Mara, nor is there any mention of the Bodhi tree. But to argue from this, that such events did not form part of the original story, might be to draw unwarranted inferences from an argumentum e silentio.) At Beluvag\u00e1ma, shortly before he finally decided to die, we are told (D.ii.99; cp. Dvy. 203) that \"there fell upon him a dire sickness, and sharp pains came upon him even unto death.\" But the Buddha conquered the disease by a strong effort of his will because he felt it would not be right for him to die without addressing his followers and taking leave of the Order. Compare with this M\u00e1ra's temptation of the Buddha at Maddakucchi (q.v.), when he laid suffering from severe pain after the wounding of his foot by a splinter. It may have been the physical weariness, above referred to, which at first made the Buddha reluctant to take upon himself the great exertions which the propagation of his Dhamma would involve (e.g., Vin.i.4f). We know of other arahants who actually committed suicide in order to escape being worried by physical ills -  e.g., Godhika, Vakkali, Channa. When their suicide was reported to the Buddha, he declared them free", "from all blame.</p><p>Can it be, further, that with the accounts of M\u00e1ra, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual devaputta, named M\u00e1ra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmita Vasavatti deva world? Already in the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya, M\u00e1ra is described (aggo \u00e1dhipateyy\u00e1nam iddhiy\u00e1 yasas\u00e1 jalam) as the head of those enjoying bliss in the K\u00e1m\u00e1vacara worlds and as a d\u00e1marika devaputta (as mentioned earlier). A.ii.17. Even after the Buddha's death M\u00e1ra was regarded as wishing to obstruct good works. Thus, at the enshrinement of the Buddha's relics in the Mah\u00e1 Th\u00fapa, Indagutta Thera (by supernatural power) made a parasol of copper to cover the universe, in order that it might ward off the attentions of M\u00e1ra (Mhv.xxxi.85).</p><p>Can it be that ancient legends represented him as looking on with disfavour at the activities of the Buddha? Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.533) that M\u00e1radevaputta, having dogged the Buddha's footsteps for seven years, and having found no fault in him, came to him and worshipped him. Is it, then, possible that some of the conversations, which the Buddha is reported to have had with M\u00e1ra -  e.g., in the second part of the Padh\u00e1na Sutta (see above)   were originally ascribed to a real personage, designated as M\u00e1radevaputta, and later confused with the allegorical M\u00e1ra? This suggestion gains strength from a remark found in the M\u00e1ratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.333; cp. D.iii.79) uttered by Moggall\u00e1na, that he too had once been a M\u00e1ra, D\u00fas\u00ed by name; K\u00e1l\u00e1 was his sister's name, and the M\u00e1ra of the present age was his nephew. In the sutta, D\u00fas\u00ed is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the M\u00e1ra of Gotama's day. According to the sutta, M\u00e1radevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men.", "This suggestion is, at all events, worthy of further investigation. See also M\u00e1rak\u00e1yik\u00e1 deva.</p><p>M\u00e1ra bears many names in P\u00e1li Literature, chief of them being Kanha, Adhipati, Antaka, Namuci and Pamattabandhu. (MNid.ii.489; for their explanation see MNidA.328; another name of M\u00e1ra was Paj\u00e1pati, MA.i.28). His usual standing epithet is p\u00e1pim\u00e1, but other words are also used, such as anatthak\u00e1ma, ahitak\u00e1ma, and ayogakkhemak\u00e1ma (E.g., M.i.118).</p><p>M\u00e1ra is called Namuci because none can escape him   Namuc\u00ed ti M\u00e1ro; so hi attano visay\u00e1 nikkhamituk\u00e1me devamanusse na mu\u00f1cati antar\u00e1yam tesam karoti tasma Namuc\u00ed ti vuccati (SNA.ii.386). In the Mah\u00e1samaya Sutta, Namuci is mentioned among the Asuras as being present in the assembly. D.ii.259; elsewhere in the same sutta (p. 261f.) it is said that when all the devas and others had assembled to hear the Buddha preach, Mara came with his \"swarthy host\" and attempted to blind the assembly with thoughts of lust, etc. But the Buddha, seeing him, warned his followers against him and M\u00e1ra had to depart unsuccessful. At the end of the sutta, four lines are traditionally ascribed to M\u00e1ra. They express admiration of the Buddha and his followers. In this sutta M\u00e1ra is described as mah\u00e1sena (having a large army).</p><p>The Commentary explains (DA.ii.689) that Namuci refers to M\u00e1radevaputta and accounts for his presence among the Asuras by the fact that he was temperamentally their companion (te pi acchandik\u00e1 abhabb\u00e1, ayam pi t\u00e1diso yeva, tasm\u00e1 dh\u00e1tuso samsandam\u00e1no \u00e1gato). Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.133; cp. MNidA. 328) that M\u00e1ra is so called because he destroys all those who seek to evade him   attano visayam atikkamitum patipanne satte m\u00e1reti ti M\u00e1ro; he is called Vasavatti (SA.i.158) because he rules all   M\u00e1ro n\u00e1ma vasavatt\u00ed sabesam upari vasam vattati.</p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman\">", "K\u00e1l\u00ed (K\u00e1l\u00e1) is the mother of M\u00e1ra of the present age.

On the twelfth day it was taken with all splendours to Anur\u00e1dhapura, to the Mah\u00e1vih\u00e1ra, where it was left for three months in the courtyard of the Bodhi tree. From there it was removed to the inner city and deposited in a magnificent image house to the south east of the palace.

But the Buddha informs Ananda that it was once Kus\u00e1vat\u00ed (q.v.), the mighty capital of Kusa and Mah\u00e1sudassana. This shows that the Mallas had, at first, a monarchical constitution, but in the sixth century B.C. they were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic (sangha, gana) (M.i.231). The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.

The Mallas seem to have lived at peace with their neighbours, though there was apparently some trouble between them and the Licchavis, as shown by the story of Bandhula Malla", "(q.v.). Both the Mallas and the Licchavis were khattiyas, belonging to the Vasittha gotta, because in the books both tribes are repeatedly referred to as V\u00e1setth\u00e1 (q.v.).

There is no such thing as power or energy or human strength or human vigour.

He seems to have believed in infinite gradations of existence; in his view, each individual thing has eternal existence, if not individually, at least in type. He evidently had definite conceptions of numerous grades of beings, celestial,", "infernal and mundane, as also of the infinity of time and the recurrent cycles of existence. He seems to have conceived the world as a system in which everything has a place and a function assigned to it, a system in which chance has no place and which admits of no other cause whatever, of the depravity or purity of beings, but that which is implied in the word Fate or Destiny (niyati). All types of things and all species of beings, however, are individually capable of transformation that is of elevation or degradation in type. His theory of purification through transmigration (sams\u00e1rasuddhi) probably meant perfection through transformation (parinat\u00e1) -  transformation which implies not only the process of constant change, but also a fixed orderly mode of progression and retrogression. All things must, in course of time, attain perfection (for a discussion on Makkhali and his doctrines see Barua: Pre buddhistic Indian Philosophy, 297ff). Makkhali's followers are known as the \u00c1j\u00edvakas (q.v.).</p><p>According to the books, the Buddha considered Makkhali as the most dangerous of the heretical teachers: \"I know not of any other single person fraught with such loss to many folk, such discomfort, such sorrow to devas and men, as Makkhali, the infatuate (A.i.33). The Buddha also considered his view the meanest -  just as the hair blanket is reckoned the meanest of all woven garments, even so, of all the teachings of recluses, that of Makkhali is the meanest (A.i.286). Buddhaghosa (DA.i.166f) draws particular distinction between the moral effect of Makkhali's doctrine on the one hand and that of the doctrines of P\u00farana Kassapa and Ajita on the other. P\u00farana, by his theory of the passivity of the soul, denied action; Ajita, by his annihilationistic theory denied retribution; whereas Makkhali, by his doctrine of fate or non causation, denied both action and its result.</p>", "<p>Very little is known of the name and the life of Makkhali. The Buddhist records call him Makkhali Gos\u00e1la. Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.143f; MA.i.422) that he was once employed as a servant; one day, while carrying an oil-pot along a muddy road, he slipped and fell through carelessness, although warned thus by his master: \"M\u00e1 khali,\" (stumble not) -  hence his name. When he found that the oil pot was broken, he fled; his master chased him and caught him by his garment, but he left it and ran along naked. He was; called Gos\u00e1la, because he was born in a cow shed. According to Jaina records (e.g. Uv\u00e1saga-das\u00e1o, p.1), he is called Gos\u00e1la Mankhaliputta; he was born at Saravana near S\u00e1vatthi, his father's name being Mankhali and his mother's Bhadd\u00e1. His father was a Mankha   i.e., a dealer in pictures-  and Gos\u00e1la followed this profession until he became a monk.</p><p>The philosopher's true name (Barua, op. cit., 298) seems to have been Maskarin, the Jaina Prakrit form of which is Mankhali and the P\u00e1li form Makkhali. \"Maskarin\" is explained by P\u00e1nin\u00ed (VI.i.154) as \"one who carries a bamboo staff\" (maskara). A Maskarin is also known as Ekadandin. According to Pata\u00f1jali (Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1sya iii.96), the name indicates a School of Wanderers who were called Maskarins, not so much because they carried a bamboo staff as because they denied the freedom of the will.

His father loved him dearly, but was a great miser, and made for him, with his own hands, a pair of burnished ear rings in order to save the goldsmith's fee; the boy thus came to be called Mattakundali (burnished ear rings). When he was sixteen he had an attack of jaundice. His father refused to call in a physician, and prescribed for him himself till the boy was beyond all cure. Then he carried him out and laid him on the terrace, lest those who came to prepare for the funeral should see his wealth.</p><p>The Buddha saw Mattakundali as he lay dying, and, out of compassion, came to the door of his father's house. Too weak to do anything else, the boy conjured up devout faith in the Buddha; he died soon after, and was born among the gods in a golden mansion thirty leagues in extent. When he surveyed his past birth, he saw his father in the charnel ground, weeping and lamenting and preparing to cremate his body. Assuming the form of Mattakundali, he went himself to the charnel ground and, standing near, started to weep. When questioned by Adinnapubbaka, he said he wanted the moon, and in the course of conversation he revealed his identity and censured his father. Adinnapubbaka invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, and, when it was over, asked if it were possible to attain to heaven by a mere act of faith. In order to convince him, the Buddha made Mattakundali appear before him and confirm his statement that this was so.

He dwelt in the forest fulfilling his novitiate, and once came to the Buddha to learn of him. The Buddha, seeing S\u00e1riputta near him wrapt in contemplation, uttered a stanza, that to the monk of lofty thoughts and heedful, sorrow comes not (See Dhammapada, 259). The monk learnt this stanza, and returning to the forest, ever and anon reflected on it. He thus came to be called Ekudd\u00e1niya. One day he obtained insight and became an arahant. Later, when Ananda asked him to preach a sermon, it was this stanza that he took as his text.</p><p>We are told that in the time of Atthadass\u00ed Buddha he was a chief of the yakkhas, and when the Buddha died he went about lamenting that he had not made use of his opportunities. A disciple of the Buddha, named S\u00e1gara, meeting him, advised him to make offering to the Buddha's th\u00fapa. In Kassapa's time he was a householder, and heard the Buddha utter the stanza mentioned above.

One fast-day two monks, versed in the Tipitaka, visited Ekudd\u00e1na with a retinue of five hundred each. Seeing them, Ekudd\u00e1na's heart was glad and he said: \"Today we will listen to the Law.\" On being asked for an explanation, he described how, when the Dhamma was expounded, the forest", "grove was filled with the applause of devas. Thereupon one of the Elders recited the Dhamma and the other expounded it, but there was no sound. In order to dispel their doubts, Ekudd\u00e1na took his seat and pronounced his one stanza.

Uppalavann\u00e1 Ther\u00ed.-One of the two chief women disciples of the Buddha. She was born in S\u00e1vatthi as the daughter of a banker, and she received the name of Uppalavann\u00e1 because her skin was the colour of the heart of the blue lotus. When she was come of age, kings and commoners from the whole of India sent messengers to her father, asking for her hand. He, not wishing to offend any of them, suggested that Uppalavann\u00e1 should leave the world. Because of her upanissaya, she very willingly agreed and was ordained a nun. Soon it came to her turn to perform certain services in the uposatha-hall. Lighting the lamp, she swept the room. Taking the flame of the lamp as her visible object, she developed tejokasina and, attaining to jh\u00e1na, became an arahant possessed of the four special attainments (patisambhid\u00e1). She became particularly versed in the mystic potency of transformation (iddhivikubbana). When the Buddha arrived at the Gandamba-tree to perform the Twin Miracle, Uppalavann\u00e1 offered to perform certain miracles herself, if the Buddha would give his consent, but this he refused (ThigA.190, 195). Later, at Jetavana, in the assembly of the Sangha, he declared her to be the chief of the women possessed of iddhi-power (A.i.25). The Ther\u00edg\u00e1th\u00e1 (vv.234-5) contains several verses attributed to her.</p><p>Three of them had been uttered in anguish by a mother who had been unwittingly living as her daughter's rival with the man who later became the monk Gang\u00e1t\u00edriya (q.v.). Uppalavann\u00e1 repeated them to help her to reflect on the harm and vileness of sensual desires. Two others are utterances of joy on the distinctions she had won and another records a miracle she performed before the Buddha, with his consent. The rest contain a conversation between Uppalavann\u00e1 and M\u00e1ra (a conversation, more or less", "identical with the foregoing, is recorded in S.i.131f), wherein she tells him that she has passed completely beyond his power.</p><p>The books give several episodes connected with Uppalavann\u00e1. Once a young man named Ananda, who was her cousin and had been in love with her during her lay-life, hid himself in her hut in Andhavana and, in spite of her protestations, deprived her of her chastity. It is said that he was swallowed up by the fires of Av\u00edc\u00ed. From that time onwards, nuns were forbidden to live in Andhavana (DhA.ii.49f; the incident is referred to in Vin.iii.35). It is said (E.g., DhA.iv.166f) that this incident gave rise to the question whether even arahants enjoyed the pleasures of love and wished to gratify their passions. Why should they not? For they are not trees nor ant-hills, but living creatures with moist flesh. The Buddha most emphatically declared that thoughts of lust never entered the hearts of the saints. On another occasion, Uppalavann\u00e1 came across, in Andhavana, some meat left behind, obviously for her, by some kind-hearted thief; having cooked the meat, she took it to the Buddha at Veluvana. Finding him away on his alms-rounds, she left the meat with Ud\u00e1yi, who was looking after the vih\u00e1ra, to be given to the Buddha, but Ud\u00e1yi insisted on Uppalavann\u00e1 giving him her inner robe as a reward for his services (Vin.iii.208f).</p><p>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.211), the miracle which Uppalavann\u00e1 volunteered to perform at the Gandamba-tree, was the assumption of the form of a cakkavatti, with a retinue extending for thirty-six leagues and the paying of homage to the Buddha, with all the cakkavatti's followers, in the presence of the multitude.</p><p>Mention is made of a pupil of Uppalavann\u00e1, who followed the Buddha for seven years, learning the Vinaya (Vin.ii.261).</p>", "<p>The Buddha declares that Khem\u00e1 and Uppalavann\u00e1 are the measure of his women disciples, and that the believing nun, if she would aspire perfectly, should aspire to be like them (A.i.88; ii.164; S.ii.236).</p><p>In Padumuttara's time Uppalavann\u00e1 saw a woman disciple who was declared to be the best of those possessed of supernormal power, and wished for herself a similar rank in the dispensation of a future Buddha. In the time of Kassapa, she was one of the seven daughters of Kik\u00ed, king of Benares, and having done many good deeds, was born in heaven. Later, she was born in the world of men and had to work for her own living. One day she gave to a Pacceka Buddha, who had just risen from sam\u00e1dhi, a meal of fried rice in his bowl and covered it with a beautiful lotus; the meal had been prepared for herself. The lotus she afterwards took back but again replaced it, asking the Pacceka Buddha's forgiveness. She expressed a wish that she should beget as many sons as there were grains of rice in her gift, and that lotuses should spring up under her feet as she walked. In her next birth she was born in a lotus. An ascetic adopted her as his daughter, but when she grew up, the king of Benares, hearing of her beauty, asked the ascetic for her hand and made her his chief queen, under the name of Padumavat\u00ed. The king's other wives were jealous of her beauty, and when the king was away, quelling a rising of the border tribes, they concealed in caskets the five hundred sons, chief of whom was the prince Mah\u00e1paduma (q.v.), that were born to Padumavat\u00ed, and told the king that Padumavat\u00ed was a non-human and had given birth to a log of wood. Padumavat\u00ed was sent away in disgrace, but later, through the instrumentality of Sakka, the trick was exposed, and Padumavat\u00ed regained all her former power and glory. (Her temporary downfall was due to her having withdrawn her gift of a lotus to the", "Pacceka Buddha.) Later, when Mah\u00e1paduma and his brothers became Pacceka Buddhas, Padumavat\u00ed died of a broken heart and was born in a village outside R\u00e1jagaha. There some of the Pacceka Buddhas who had been her sons discovered her, and they all came to a meal at her house. At the conclusion of the meal she offered them blue lotuses, and expressed the wish that her complexion should be like the matrix of the blue lotus. </p><p>This account is a summary of the Ther\u00edg\u00e1th\u00e1 Commentary, pp.182ff; AA.i.188ff; but see also DhA.ii.48f.</p><p>The Apad\u00e1na account of the past lives of Uppakavanna differs from the above in several details (ii.551. But vv.1-15 quoted in the ThigA. differ from those in the Apad\u00e1na, and agree with the ThigA. account). According to this account, in Padumuttara's time she was a N\u00e1ga maiden named Vimal\u00e1 and was impressed by the iddhi-powers displayed by a nun, hence her wish for similar powers. The Apad\u00e1na also mentions Uppalavann\u00e1's birth as the daughter of a banker of Benares, in the time of Vipass\u00ed. She gave great alms to the Buddha and the monks and made offerings of lotuses. She was the second daughter of Kik\u00ed and her name was Samannagutt\u00e1. In her next birth she became the ravishing daughter of Tir\u00edtavaccha of Aritthapura. In her last birth she became an arahant within a fortnight of her ordination.</p><p>Uppalavann\u00e1's name occurs several times in the J\u00e1takas.

He went to work early in the morning and returned late in the evening. When he discovered that all the others were keeping the fast he refused to touch any food and, as a result, died the same night. Just before death he saw the king of Benares passing in procession with great splendour, and felt a desire for royalty. He was therefore born as the son of the king of Benares and was named Udaya. In due course he became king, and one day, having seen Addham\u00e1saka (q.v.) and learnt his story, he gave him half his kingdom. Later, when Addham\u00e1saka confessed to him the evil idea that had passed through his mind of killing the king in order to gain the whole kingdom, Udaya, realising the wickedness of desire, renounced the kingdom and became an ascetic in the Him\u00e1laya.

The Mah\u00e1vastu (iii.431f) also mentions an Upasena who was nephew to the Tebh\u00e1tika Jatilas. When the Tebh\u00e1tikas accepted the Buddha as their teacher, they cast the garments, etc., which they had used as ascetics, into the Nera\u00f1jar\u00e1, on the banks of which was Upasena's hermitage.

When he came of age, he learnt the three Vedas, and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order. When his ordination was but one year old, he ordained another bhikkhu, to increase the number of holy ones, and went with him to wait upon the Buddha. The Buddha roundly rebuked him for this hasty procedure (Vin.i.59; Sp.i.194; J.ii.449), and Upasena, wishing to earn the Master's praise on account of the very cause of this rebuke, practised insight and became an arahant. Thereafter he adopted various dhutangas and persuaded others to do likewise. In a short", "time he had a large retinue, each member of which was charming in his way, and the Buddha declared Upasena to be the best of those who were altogether charming (samantap\u00e1s\u00e1dik\u00e1nam) (A.i.24).

AA.i.152; also Mil.360, where more details are given of how Upasena admitted monks into the Order and of the conditions imposed on them; for a slightly different version see Vin.iii.230ff; it is said there that after Upasena's visit, the Buddha allowed monks who practised dhutangas, to visit him even during his periods of retreat.

The Milinda-pa\u00f1ha (pp.393, 394) contains several other verses attributed to Upasena similar in their trend of ideas and admonitions. The Ud\u00e1na states (p.45f; UdA.266ff) that once when he was taking his siesta he reviewed the happiness he enjoyed and the glories of the life he led under the guidance of the Buddha. The Buddha, noticing this, proclaimed his approval.</p><p>One day, while Upasena was sitting after his meal in the shadow of the Sappasondika-pabbh\u00e1ra, fanned by the gentle", "breeze, mending his outer robe, two young snakes were sporting in the tendrils overhanging the cave.

One day he heard the Buddha declare one of his monks to be the best of those who were altogether charming, and wished for a similar declaration regarding himself by some future Buddha. Towards this end he did many deeds of piety (ThagA.i.525). The Apad\u00e1na mentions that he gave a meal to Padumuttara and eight monks, and at the meal placed over the Buddha's head a parasol made of kanikdra-flowers.

Among householders he was declared by the Buddha to be the best of those who waited on the Order (sanghupatth\u00e1k\u00e1nam) (A.i.26). On his father's death he was appointed to the post of setthi. Once when the Buddha went to Hatthig\u00e1ma during a tour and was staying in the N\u00e1gavanuyy\u00e1na there, Ugga came to the pleasance, with dancers, at the conclusion of a drinking-feast of seven days' duration. At the sight of the Buddha he was seized with great shame and his intoxication vanished. The Buddha preached to him and he became an an\u00e1g\u00e1m\u00ed. Thereupon he dismissed his dancers and devoted himself to looking after members of the Sangha. Devas visited him at night and told him of the attainments of various monks, suggesting that he should choose only the eminent", "ones as the recipients of his gifts. But what he gave, he gave to all with equal delight (AA.i.214-5).</p><p>The Buddha once stated that Ugga was possessed of eight special and wonderful qualities. One of the monks, hearing the Buddha's statement, went to Ugga and asked him what these qualities were. Ugga replied that he was not aware of what the Buddha had in mind and proceeded to explain eight wonderful things that had happened to him, viz.:  </p><ul>  <li>(1) As soon as he saw the Buddha, his state of drunkenness vanished and he made obeisance to the Buddha, who talked to him on various topics, such as d\u00e1na, s\u00edla, etc. </li>  <li>(2) When the Buddha saw that Ugga's mind was ready, he preached to him the Four Truths, which he understood and realised. </li>  <li>(3) He had had four young and beautiful wives; when he took the vow of celibacy, he made ample provision for them; for one of them he obtained the husband of her choice, because she so desired, and this he did with no tinge of jealousy. </li>  <li>(4) All his immense wealth he shared with men of good and lovely conduct. </li>  <li>(5) On whatever monk he waited, he did it with whole-heartedness; to the monk's preaching he listened earnestly; if the monk did not preach, Ugga himself taught him the doctrine. </li>  <li>(6) Devas told him of the different attainments of various monks, but he   gave to all alike, without distinction. </li>  <li>(7) He felt no pride that he should hold converse with devas. </li>  <li>(8) He did not worry about death because the Buddha had assured him that   he would never more return to this world.</li></ul><p>The monk reports this conversation to the Buddha and the Buddha tells him that these were the very qualities he had in", "mind when praising Ugga (A.iv.212-6).</p><p>The Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya (Vajj\u00ed Sutta<b>, </b>S.iv.109f) records a visit paid to the Buddha by Ugga, at Hatthig\u00e1maka. He asked the Buddha why it was that some beings attained full freedom in this very life, while others did not. Because of grasping, says the Buddha.</p><p>Ugga had been a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He once heard the Buddha preach and declare, at the end of his sermon, one of his lay disciples to be the best of those who waited on the Order. He wished for himself a similar attainment and did many good deeds towards that end (AA.i.214). v.l. Uggata.</p><hr><p><b>5.

He came to be called Ugga-setthi, because he was tall in body, lofty in morals and of striking personality. The very first time he saw the Buddha, he became a sot\u00e1panna and later an an\u00e1g\u00e1m\u00ed. When he was old, the thought came to him one day, while he was alone, \"I will give to the Buddha whatever I consider most attractive to myself and I have heard from him that such a giver obtains his wishes. I wish the Buddha would come to my house now.\" The Buddha, reading his thoughts, appeared before his door with a following of monks. He received them with great respect and, having given them a meal, announced to the Buddha his intention of providing him and the monks with whatever they found agreeable (AA.i.213-4).</p><p>While staying at the K\u00fat\u00e1g\u00e1ras\u00e1l\u00e1 in Ves\u00e1li, the Buddha once declared to the monks that Ugga was possessed of eight marvellous qualities. The rest of the story is very similar to that of Ugga of", "Hatthig\u00e1maka, given above. This Ugga states as the first wonderful thing which happened to him, the faith he found in the Buddha at their very first meeting; three and four are the same; the fifth is that whatever monk he waits on, he does it whole-heartedly; the sixth, that if the monk preaches he would listen with attention, if the monk does not preach, Ugga would teach to him the doctrine; the seventh is the same; the eighth that he has got rid of all the orambh\u00e1giya-samyojanas mentioned by the Buddha. The conversation is reported to the Buddha who agrees that Ugga does possess the qualities mentioned (A.iv.208-12).</p><p>The Samyutta Nik\u00e1ya (S.iv.109f) repeats under Ugga of Ves\u00e1li the same discussion with the Buddha as was given in connection with Ugga of Hatthig\u00e1ma, regarding the reason why some beings do not attain complete freedom in this very life. This is perhaps due to uncertainty on the part of the compilers as to which Ugga took part in the original discussion.</p><p>A sutta in the Anguttara Nik\u00e1ya (A.iii.49-51) gives a list of things of which Ugga himself was fond. We are told that he offered these things to the Buddha. The list includes rice-cakes made in the shape of S\u00e1la-blossoms, the flesh of sucking pig and K\u00e1si robes. These and other things were given not only to the Buddha, but, according to the Commentary (AA.ii.602), also to five hundred monks. The Sutta goes on to say that Ugga died soon after and was born among the Manomayadev\u00e1. He visited the Buddha from the deva-world and stated that he had achieved his goal (of reaching arahantship).</p><p>He is included in a list of householders who possessed six special qualities: unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, Ariyan conduct, insight and liberation (A.iv.451).</p><p>His desire to become chief of those who", "give agreeable things was first conceived in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he was a householder in Hamsavat\u00ed; he heard the Buddha describe one of his disciples as being a giver of such gifts (AA.i.213).</p><hr><p><b>6.

Mhv.xix.68ff; the Tik\u00e1 (p.408) says the houses were originally called C\u00falagan\u00e1-g\u00e1ra, Mah\u00e1gan\u00e1g\u00e1ra and Sirivaddh\u00e1g\u00e1ra. </p><hr><hr>"}, {"data": "<ul>  <li>  <h2>Uposatha Sutt\u00e1</h2>  </li></ul><hr><p>1.

Looking round and finding them seated in silence, he spoke their praises, saying how some of them had won access to the devas, some to Brahma, others to the Imperturbable (\u00e1nejja), and yet others to the Ariyan state.

Three times he asks, but the Buddha remains silent, and at last says that the assembly is impure. Mah\u00e1moggall\u00e1na, who is present, looks round, and seeing there a monk given up to wicked ways, asks him to leave. On his refusing to do so, Moggall\u00e1na takes him by the hand and leads him away. Thereupon the Buddha proceeds to explain how, just as the sea is full of eight kinds of marvels, so is the Dhamma.

The Buddha explains to her that there are various ways of observing the sabbath; these he describes as the herdsman's sabbath, the sabbath of the naked ascetics and the sabbath of the Ariyans.

Once M\u00e1ra came to him in the darkness of the night in the guise of a terrifying elephant, trying to frighten him. On another dark night when the rain was falling drop by drop, M\u00e1ra came to the Buddha and assumed various wondrous shapes, beautiful and ugly. Another time M\u00e1ra tried to fill the Buddha's mind with doubt as to whether he had really broken away from all fetters and won complete Enlightenment (S.i.103ff). Seven years after the Buddha's Renunciation, M\u00e1ra made one more attempt to make the Buddha discontented with his lonely lot and it was then, when M\u00e1ra had gone away discomfited, that Mars's three daughters, Tanh\u00e1, Rat\u00ed and Rag\u00e1, made a final effort to draw the Buddha away from his purpose (S.i.124f).  </p>", "<p>It was at Uruvel\u00e1, too, that the Buddha had misgivings in his own mind as to the usefulness of preaching the Doctrine which he had realised, to a world blinded by passions and prejudices. The Brahm\u00e1 <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sahampati')\">Sahampat\u00ed</a> thereupon entreated the Buddha not to give way to such diffidence (S.i.136ff; Vin.i.4f). It is recorded that either on this very occasion or quite soon after, the thought arose in the Buddha's mind that the sole method of winning Nibb\u00e1na was to cultivate the four <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/satipatthaana')\">satipatth\u00e1nas</a> and that Sahampat\u00ed visited the Blessed One and confirmed his view (S.v.167; and again, 185). A different version occurs elsewhere (S.v.232), where the thought which arose in the Buddha's mind referred to the five controlling faculties (saddhindriya, etc.), and Brahm\u00e1 tells the Buddha that in the time of Kassapa he had been a monk named Sahaka and that then he had practised these five faculties.</p><p>The name Uruvela is explained as meaning a great sandbank (mah\u00e1 vel\u00e1, mahanto v\u00e1likar\u00e1si). A story is told which furnishes an alternative explanation: Before the Buddha's appearance in the world, ten thousand ascetics lived in this locality, and they decided among themselves that if any evil thought arose in the mind of any one of them, he should carry a basket of sand to a certain spot. The sand so collected eventually formed a great bank (AA.ii.476; UdA.26; MA.i.376; MT.84). In the Divy\u00e1vad\u00e1na (p.202), the place is called Uruvilv\u00e1.

Uruvel\u00e1 was evidently a port as well, because we are told that when Dutthag\u00e1man\u00ed decided to build the Mah\u00e1-Th\u00fapa, six wagonloads of pearls as large as myrobalan fruit, mixed with coral, appeared on dry land at the Uruvela-pattana (Mhv.xxviii.36).
