<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vessantara Játaka (No. 547)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessantara (the Bodhisatta) was the son of Sañjaya, king of Sivi, and queen Phusatí, and was so called because his mother started in labour as she passed through the vessa street in the city of Jetuttara, and he was born in a house in the same street. He spoke as soon as he was born (Cf. BuA.228). On the same day was also born a white elephant named Paccaya. At the age of eight, Vessantara wished to make a great gift and the earth trembled. He married Maddí at the age of sixteen, and their children were Jáli and Kanhajiná.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time there was a great drought in Kálinga, and eight brahmins came from there to Vessantara to beg his white elephant, which had the power of making rain to fall. He granted their request, and gave the elephant together with its priceless trappings (J.vi.488f. gives the details of these). The citizens of Jetuttara were greatly upset that their elephant should have been given away, and demanded of Sañjaya that Vessantara should be banished to Vankagiri. The will of the people prevailed, and Vessantara was asked to take the road along which those travel who have offended. He agreed to go, but before setting out, obtained the king's leave to hold an almsgiving called the &quot;Gift of the Seven Hundreds&quot; (Sattasataka), in which he gave away seven hundred of each kind of thing. People came from all over Jambudípa to accept his gifts, and the almsgiving lasted for a whole day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Vessantara took leave of his parents and prepared for his journey, Maddí insisted on accompanying him with her two children. They were conveyed in a gorgeous carriage drawn by four horses, but, outside the city, Vessantara met four brahmins who begged his horses. Four devas then drew the chariot, but another brahmin soon appeared and obtained the chariot. </data>
<data>Thenceforward they travelled on foot, through Suvannagiritála, across the river Kantimárá, to beyond Mount Arañjaragiri and Dunnivittha, to his uncle's city, in the kingdom of Ceta. The devas shortened the way for them, and the trees lowered their fruit that they might eat. Sixty thousand khattiyas came out to welcome Vessantara and offered him their kingdom, which, however, he refused. He would not even enter the city, but remained outside the gates, and, when he left early the next morning, the people of Ceta, led by Cetaputta, went with him for fifteen leagues, till they came to the entrance to the forest. Vessantara and his family then proceeded to Gandhamádana, northwards, by the foot of Mount Vipula to the river Ketumatí, where a forester entertained them and gave them to eat. Thence they crossed the river to beyond Nálika, along the bank of Lake Mucalinda, to its north eastern corner, then along a narrow footpath into the dense forest, to Vankagiri. There Vissakamma had already built two hermitages, by order of Sakka, one for Vessantara and one for Maddí and the children, and there they took up their residence. By Vessantara's power, the wild animals to a distance of three leagues became gentle. Maddí rose daily at dawn, and, having fetched water to wash, went into the forest for yams and fruit. In the evening she returned, washed the children, and the family sat down to eat. Thus passed four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then from Dunnivittha there came to the hermitage an old brahmin, called Jújaka, who had been sent by his young wife, Amittatápaná, to find slaves for her, because when she went to the well for water the other women had laughed at her, calling her &quot;old man's darling.&quot; She told Jújaka that he could easily get Vessantara's children as slaves, and so he came to Vankagiri. Asking the way of various people, including the hermit Accuta, Jújaka arrived at </data>
<data>Vankagiri late in the evening and spent the night on the hilltop. That night Maddí had a dream, and, being terrified, she sought Vessantara. He knew what the dream presaged, but consoled her and sent her away the next day in search of food. During her absence, Jújaka came and made his request. He would not await the return of Maddí, and Vessantara willingly gave him the two children. But they ran away and hid in a pond till told by their father to go with Jújaka. When Vessantara poured water on Jújaka's hand as a symbol of his gift, the earth trembled with joy. Once more the children escaped and ran back to their father, but he strengthened his resolve with tears in his eyes. Jújaka led the children away, beating them along the road till their blood flowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was late in the evening when Maddí returned because devas, assuming the form of beasts of prey, delayed her coming, lest she should stand in the way of Vessantara's gift. In answer to her questions, Vessantara spoke no word, and she spent the night searching for the children. In the morning she returned to the hermitage and fell down fainting. Vessantara restored her to consciousness and told her of what had happened, explaining why he had not told her earlier. When she had heard his story she expressed her joy, affirming that he had made a noble gift for the sake of omniscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, lest some vile creature should come and ask for Maddí, Sakka, assuming the form of a brahmin, appeared and asked for her Vessantara looked at Maddí, and she expressed her consent. So he gave Maddí to the brahmin, and the earth trembled. Sakka revealed his identity, gave Maddí back to Vessantara, and allowed him eight boons. Vessantara asked that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) he be recalled to his father's city, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) he should condemn no man to death, &lt;/li&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;li&gt;(3) he should be a helpmate to all alike &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) he should not be guilty of adultery, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(5) his son should have long life: &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(6) he should have celestial food, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(7) his means of giving should never fail, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(8) after death he should be reborn in heaven.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Jújaka had travelled sixty leagues with the children, whom the devas cared for and protected. Guided by the devas, they arrived in fifteen days at Jetuttara, though Jújaka had intended to go to Kálinga. Sañjaya bought the children from Jújaka, paying a high price, including the gift of a seven storeyed palace. But Jújaka died of over eating, and as no relation of his could be traced, his possessions came back to the king. Sañjaya ordered his army to be prepared and a road to be built from Jetuttara to Vankagiri, eight usabhas wide. Seven days later, led by Jáli, Sañjaya and Phusatí started for Vankagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the army was the white elephant, who had been returned because the people of Kálinga could not maintain him. There was great rejoicing at the reunion of the family, and the six royal personages fell in a swoon till they were revived by rain sent by Sakka, the rain only wetting those who so wished it. Vessantara was crowned king of Sivi, with Maddí as his consort. After a month's merry making in the forest, they returned to Jetuttara. On the day Vessantara entered the city he set free every captive, including even cats. In the evening, as he lay wondering how he would be able to satisfy his suitors the next day, Sakka's throne was heated, and he sent down a shower of the seven kinds of precious things, till the palace grounds were filled waist high. Vessantara was thus able to practise his generosity to the end of his days. </data>
<data>After death he was born in Tusita (J.i.47; DhA.i.69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related on the occasion of the Buddha's first visit to Kapilavatthu. The Buddha's kinsmen escorted him to the Nigrodháráma, but sat round him without doing any obeisance, because of their great pride. The Buddha then performed the Twin Miracle, and the Sákyans, led by&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt;, worshipped him. There was then a shower of rain, refreshing all and falling only on those who so wished. When the people expressed their wonder, the Buddha related this story, showing that in the past, too, rain had fallen on his kinsfolk to revive them. (According to BuA.245, the Játaka was related at the end of the recital of the Buddhavamsa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Devadatta is identified with Jújaka, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Cincá with Amittatápaná, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Channa with Cetaputta, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sáriputta with Accuta, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Anuruddha with Sakka, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sañjaya with Suddhodana, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mahámáyá with Phusatí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ráhulamátá with Maddí, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ráhula with Jáli, and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Uppalavanna with Kanhajiná. (The story is given at   J.vi.479-593).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story also occurs in the Cariyápitaka (i.9), and is often referred to (E.g., Sp.i.245; VbhA.414; Cv.xlii.5; c.74) as that of a birth in which the Bodhisatta's dána páramitá reached its culmination. The earth shook seven times when Vessantara made his gifts, and this forms the subject of a dilemma in the Milinda-Pañha. (Mil. p.113; for another question, see ibid. 274f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the Játaka was sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahá Thúpa. (Mhv.xxx.88).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Vessantara is the first of the Játakas to </data>

The mountain has diminished in size, for the Tivaras, who lived for forty thousand years, took four days to climb it and four to descend; the Rohitassas lived for thirty thousand years and took three days each way; while the Suppiyas, with a life span of twenty thousand years, did the journey there and back in four days. In the present age, the Magadhans, who lived for about one hundred years, could both climb and descend the mountain in very little time (S.ii.190f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vepulla was the abode of the Yakkha Kumbhíra and his one hundred thousand followers (D.ii.257).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dummedha_jat_50_122')"&gt;Dummedha Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.445) it was possible for an elephant to climb to the top of Vepulla.

The quality of the food is not important, says the Buddha, but only the heart of the giver, whether the giving is done casually or considerately and with devotion, and whether the recipients are worthy. He then tells of the great gifts made by &lt;a href="velaama')"&gt;Veláma&lt;/a&gt;. Though the gifts were great, Veláma could find no holy persons as recipients. The Buddha then goes on to say that greater than the giving of alms, or even the building of monasteries, is the taking of the Refuges, the observance of good conduct, the practice of amity, and the thinking of impermanence, each of these being greater than the last. (A.iv.392ff.; the sutta is referred to at DhA.iii.11; KhA.222; DA.i.234 VibhA.414).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on this occasion that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khadirangaara_jat_40')"&gt;Khadirangára Játaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Bodhisatta warned the ascetic against the snake, but his warning was unheeded. The hermit thus came to be called Velukapitá. One day the hermits went into the forest and were away for a few days, and when Velukapitá touched the viper on his return, the animal, hungry and angry, bit him, and he fell down dead. The story was told in reference to a headstrong monk who is identified with Velukapitá. J.i.245f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vesáli&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city, capital of the Licchavis. The Buddha first visited it in the fifth year after the Enlightenment, and spent the vassa there (BuA., p. 3). The Commentaries give detailed descriptions of the circumstances of this visit. KhpA.160ff.= SNA.i.278; DhA.iii.436ff.; cp. Mtu.i.253ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesáli was inhabited by seven thousand and seven rájás, each of whom had large retinues, many palaces and pleasure parks. There came a shortage in the food supply owing to drought, and people died in large numbers. The smell of decaying bodies attracted evil spirits, and many inhabitants were attacked by intestinal disease. The people complained to the ruling prince, and he convoked a general assembly, where it was decided, after much discussion, to invite the Buddha to their city. As the Buddha was then at Veluvana in Rájagaha, the Licchavi Maháli, friend of Bimbisára and son of the chaplain of Vesáli, was sent to Bimbisára with a request that he should persuade the Buddha to go to Vesáli. Bimbisára referred him to the Buddha himself, who, after listening to Maháli's story, agreed to go. The Buddha started on the journey with five hundred monks. Bimbisára decorated the route from Rájagaha to the Ganges, a distance of five leagues, and provided all comforts on the way. He accompanied the Buddha, and the Ganges was reached in five days. Boats, decked with great splendour, were ready for the Buddha and his monks, and we are told that Bimbisára followed the Buddha into the water up to his neck. The Buddha was received on the opposite bank by the Licchavis, with even greater honour than Bimbisára had shown him. As soon as the Buddha set foot in the Vajjian territory, there was a thunderstorm and rain fell in torrents. The distance from the Ganges to Vesáli was three leagues; as the Buddha approached Vesáli, Sakka </data>
<data>came to greet him, and, at the sight of the devas, all the evil spirits fled in fear. In the evening the Buddha taught Ananda the Ratana Sutta, and ordered that it should be recited within the three walls of the city, the round of the city being made with the Licchavi princes. This Ananda did during the three watches of the night, and all the pestilences of the citizens disappeared. The Buddha himself recited the Ratana Sutta to the assembled people, and eighty four thousand beings were converted. After repeating this for seven consecutive days, the Buddha left Vesáli. (According to the DhA. account the Buddha stayed only seven days in Vesáli; KhA. says two weeks). The Licchavis accompanied him to the Ganges with redoubled honours, and, in the river itself, Devas and Nágas vied with each other in paying him honour. On the farther bank, Bimbisára awaited his arrival and conducted him back to Rájagaha. On his return there, the Buddha recited the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankha')"&gt;Sankha Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. (See 2.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was probably during this visit of the Buddha to Vesáli that Suddhodana died. (See ThigA., p. 141; AA.i.186). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was during this visit of the Buddha to Kapilavatthu (tadá) that Mahá Pajápatí Gotamí first asked his permission to join the Order, but her request was refused (AA.i.186).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one account, the Buddha went through the air to visit his dying father and to preach to him, thereby enabling him to attain arahantship before his death. It is not possible to know how many visits were paid by the Buddha to Vesáli, but the books would lead us to infer that they were several. Various Vinaya rules are mentioned as having been laid down at Vesáli. See, e.g., Vin.i.238, 287f; ii.118, 119 27. The visit mentioned in the last context seems to have been a long one; it was on this occasion that the </data>
<data>Buddha ordered the monks to turn their bowls upon the Licchavi Vaddha (q.v.). For other Vinaya rules laid down at Vesáli, see also Vin.ii.159f.; iii. and iv. passim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was during a stay in Vesáli, whither he had gone from Kapilavatthu, that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Mahá Pajápatí Gotamí&lt;/a&gt; followed the Buddha with five hundred other Sákyan women, and, with the help of Ananda's intervention, obtained permission for women to enter the Order under certain conditions. Vin.ii.253ff.; see&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Mahá Pajápatí Gotamí&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books describe (E.g., D.ii.95ff) at some length the Buddha's last visit to Vesáli on his way to Kusinárá. On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ananda to Cápála cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ananda of the beauties of Vesáli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sárandada cetiya. Cf. Mtu.i.300, where a Kapinayha-cetiya is also mentioned. All these were once shrines dedicated to various local deities, but after the Buddha's visit to Vesáli, they were converted into places of Buddhist worship. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesáli   e.g., Pátikáráma, Válikáráma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha generally stayed at the Kútágárasálá (q.v.) during his visits to Vesáli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines (See D.ii.118). During his last visit to the Cápála cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed Mára and, later, Ananda, of his decision. The next day he left Vesáli for Bhandagáma, after taking one last look at the city, &quot;turning his whole body round, like an elephant&quot; (nágápalokitam apaloketvá) (D.ii.122). The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent </data>
<data>at Beluvagáma, a suburb of Vesáli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesáli. On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapáli invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order (D.ii.98; but see Dial.ii.102, n.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesáli was a stronghold of the Niganthas, and it is said that of the forty two rainy seasons of the latter part of Mahávíra's ascetic life, he passed twelve at Vesáli. Jacobi: Jaina Sutras (S.B.E.) Kalpa Sútra, sect. 122; Vesáli was also the residence of Kandaramasuka and Pátikaputta (q.v.). Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesáli, special mention is made of Ugga (chief of those who gave pleasant gifts), Pingiyáni, Káranapáli, Síha, Vásettha (A.iv.258), and the various Licchavis (see Licchavi.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha's presence in Vesáli was a source of discomfort to the Niganthas, and we find mention (See, e.g., Síha) of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Buddha, Vesáli was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. There were seven thousand seven hundred and seven pleasure grounds and an equal number of lotus ponds. Its courtesan, Ambapálí, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous (Vin.i.268). The city had three walls, each one gávuta away from the other, and at three places in the walls were gates with watch towers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.i.604; cf.i.389. Perhaps these three walls separated the three districts of Vaisálí mentioned in the Tibetan Dulva (Rockhill, p.62); Hoernle (Uvásagadasáo Translation ii., p.4, n.8) identifies these three districts with the city proper, Kundapura and Vániyagáma, respectively mentioned in the Jaina books. Buddhaghosa says (e.g., Sp.ii.393) that Vesáli was so called </data>
<data>because it was extensive (visálíbhútatá Vesáli ti uccati); cf. UdA.184 (tikkhattum visálabhútattá); and MA.i.259. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the town, leading uninterruptedly up to the Himálaya, was the Mahávana (DA.i.309) (q.v.), a large, natural forest. Near by were other forests, such as Gosingalasála. (A.v.134)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among important suttas preached at Vesáli are the Maháli, Mahásíhanáda, Cúla Saccaka, Mahá Saccaka, Tevijja, Vacchagotta, Sunakkhatta and Ratana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also A.i.220, 276; ii.190, 200; iii.38, 49ff., 75, 142, 167, 236, 239; iv. 16, 79, 100, 179, 208, 274ff., 279ff., 308ff.; v. 86, 133, 342; S.i.29, 112, 230; ii.267, 280; iii.68, 116; iv. 109, 210ff., 380; v. 141f, 152f, 258, 301, 320, 389, 453; D.ii.94ff.; the subjects of these discourses are mentioned passim, in their proper places; see also DhA.i.263; iii.267, 279, 460, 480.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Telováda Játaka (No. 246) and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sigala_jat_113_142_8')"&gt;Sigála Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (No. 152) were preached at Vesáli. After the Buddha's death a portion of his relics was enshrined in the City. (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred years later Vesáli was again the scene of interest for Buddhists, on account of the &quot;Ten Points&quot; raised by the Vajjiputtaká, (q.v.), and the second Council held in connection with this dispute at the Válikáráma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city was also called Visálá. (E.g., AA.i.47; Cv.xcix.98). There were Nágas living in Vesáli; these were called Vesálá (D.ii.258).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesáli is identified with the present village of Basrah in the Muzafferpur district in Tirhut. See Vincent Smith, J.R.A.S. 1907, p. 267f., and Marshall, Arch. Survey of India, 1903 4, p. 74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

For details see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sambhava_jat_515')"&gt;Sambhava Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. He is identified with Mahá Kassapa (J.v.67).

See the &lt;a href="vidhurapandita_jat_545')"&gt;Vidhurapandita Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His father was the brahmin &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/canda')"&gt;Canda&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.262), and he owned three palaces: Koñca, Mayúra and Piyaketa (J.vi.289).

A monk can, in five ways, get rid of bad thoughts associated with lust, hatred, and delusion: by diverting his mind elsewhere; by scrutiny of their perilous consequence; by ignoring bad and wrong thoughts; by allaying what moulds these thoughts; by subduing them by sheer force of mind. These different methods are illustrated by similes. M.i.118 122.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day the owl stood with lowered wings, its claws clasped together. The Buddha smiled when he saw it, and, in reply to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda’s&lt;/a&gt; question, said that the owl, after spending one hundred thousand kappas among gods and men, would become a Pacceka Buddha named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somanassa')"&gt;Somanassa&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MA.i.255 f; cp.

The sutta is also called the &lt;b&gt;Káyavicchandanika Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is a discourse on the foul nature of the body, full of impurities flowing in nine streams; when dead, nobody cares for it.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vissakamma, Vissukamma&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deva, inhabitant of Távatimsa. He is the chief architect, designer and decorator among the devas, and Sakka asks for his services whenever necessary. Thus he was ordered to build the palace called Dhamma for Mahásudassana (D.ii.180) and another for Mahápanáda (J.iv.323; DA.iii.856). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also built the hermitages for the Bodhisatta in various births -  e.g., as &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sumedha (J.i.7)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Kuddálapandita (J.i.314)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Hatthipála (J.iv.489)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ayoghara (J.iv.499)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Jotipála (J.v.132)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sutasoma (J.v.190)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Temiya (J.vi.21, 29) &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Vessantara (J.vi.519f)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vissakamma also built the hermitage for Dukúlaka and Páriká (J.vi.72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day that the Buddha renounced the world, Sakka sent Vissakamma in the guise of a shampooer to bathe him and clothe him in his royal ornaments (J.i.60; DhA.i.70; BuA.232; he also constructed ponds in which the prince might bathe, AA.i.379); he also sent him to adorn Temiya on the day he left the kingdom (J.vi.12). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vissakamma erected the jewelled pavilion, twelve leagues in compass, under the Gandamba, where the Buddha performed the Twin Miracle and built the three stairways of jewels, silver and gold, used by the Buddha in his descent from Távatimsa to Sankassa (J.iv.265f). He built, the pavilions in which the Buddha and five hundred arahants travelled to Uggapura, at the invitation of Culla Subhaddá. (DhA.iii.470; and again for the journey to Sunápuranta, MA.ii.1017). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ajátasattu deposited his share of the Buddha's relics in a thúpa, Sakka ordered Vissakamma to construct around the thúpa a </data>
<data>válasanghátayanta (revolving wheel?) to prevent anyone from approaching the relics. Later, when Dhammásoka (Piyadassí) wished to obtain these relics for his vihára, Vissakamma appeared before him in the guise of a village youth and, by shooting an arrow at the controlling screw of the machine, stopped its revolutions (DA.ii.613, 614). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He constructed the jewelled pavilion in which Sonuttara placed the relies he brought from the Nága world till the time came for them to be deposited in the Mahá Thúpa, (Mhv.xxxi.76) and on the day of their enshrinement, Vissakamma, acting on Sakka's orders, decorated the whole of Ceylon (Mhv.xxxi.34). He also provided the bricks used in the construction of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxviii.8). Sometimes he would enter into a workman's body and inspire him with ideas -  e.g., in designing the form of the Mahá Thúpa (Mhv.xxx.11). He was also responsible for the construction of the golden vase in which the branch of the Bodhi tree was conveyed to Ceylon (Mhv.xviii.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in the case of Mátalí and Sakka, Vissakamma is evidently the name of an office and not a personal name. Thus, in the Suruci Játaka (J.iv. 325), Vissakamma is mentioned as a previous birth of Ananda, while, according to the Dhammapada Commentary, the architect who helped Magha and his companions in their good works, was reborn as Vissakamma. DhA.i.272. The story given regarding Vissakamma in SNA.i.233, evidently refers to the Mahákanha Játaka. The deva who accompanied Sakka in the guise of a dog in that Játaka was Mátali and not Vissakamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Visvakarma in Hopkins' Epic Mythology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Bu.xiv.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Visákhá.&lt;/b&gt; Mother of Kakusandha Buddha and wife of Aggidatta. Bu.xxiii.58; J.i.94; D.ii.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Visákhá. &lt;/b&gt;One of the five queens of the third Okkáka. DA.i.238; SNA.i.352; MT. 131.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Visákhá Therí.&lt;/b&gt; She belonged to the harem of the Bodhisatta and left the world with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Mahá Pajápatí Gotamí&lt;/a&gt;. She received a topic of meditation from the Buddha and in due course won arahantship. A verse uttered by her, admonishing her companions, is included in the Therígáthá. Thig.vs.13; ThigA.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Visákhá&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief among the female lay disciples of the Buddha and declared by him to be foremost among those who ministered to the Order (dáyikánam aggá) (A.i.26; she is considered the ideal lay woman - e.g., A.iv.348). Her father was Dhanañjaya, son of Mendaka, and her mother Sumaná. She was born in the city of Bhaddiya in Anga. When she was seven years old, the Buddha visited Bhaddiya with a large company of monks, out of compassion for the brahmin Sela and others. Mendaka gave Visákhá five hundred companions, five hundred slaves, and five hundred chariots, that she might visit the Buddha. She stopped the chariots some distance away and approached the Buddha on foot. He preached to her and she became a sotápanna. For the next fortnight Mendaka invited the Buddha and his monks daily to his house, where he fed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when, at Pasenadi's request, Bimbisára sent Dhanañjaya to live in Kosala, Visákhá accompanied her parents and lived in </data>
<data>Sáketa. The messengers, sent by Migára of Sávatthi to find a suitable bride for his son Paññavaddhana, saw Visákhá on her way to the lake to bathe on a feast day. At that moment there was a great shower. Visákhá's companions ran for shelter, but Visákhá herself, walking at her usual pace, came to the place where the messengers, already greatly impressed, were awaiting her. When they asked her why she did not run to seek shelter and so preserve her clothes, she answered that she had plenty of clothes in the house, but that if she ran she might damage a limb which would be a great loss. &quot;Unmarried girls,&quot; she said, &quot;are like goods awaiting sale, they must not be disfigured.&quot; The messengers offered her a bouquet of flowers (málágulam), which she accepted as a proposal of marriage, and then went on to her father's house. The messengers followed and laid Punnavaddhana's suit before Dhanañjaya. The proposal was accepted and confirmed by an exchange of letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pasenadi heard of it, he offered to accompany Punnavaddhana to Sáketa, as a mark of signal favour. Dhanañjaya welcomed the king and his retinue, Migára, Punnavaddhana and their followers, with all honour, attending personally to all the details of hospitality. He persuaded the king to stay with him during the rains, providing all that was necessary. According to the DhA. account (loc. cit.) Visákhá superintended all the arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five hundred goldsmiths were engaged to make the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahalata_pasadhana')"&gt;Mahálatápasádhana&lt;/a&gt; (ornament), q.v., for the bride; three months passed, but it was still unfinished. The supply of firewood ran out, and orders were given that the wood of dilapidated houses should be used. This wood lasted for a fortnight, and then the storehouses containing cloths were opened, the cloths soaked in oil </data>
<data>and used for cooking the food. The ornament was finished in four months. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she gave bowls and robes to twenty thousand monks, also thread and needles and sewing materials; as a result of this, she received her parure in this life (DhA.i.395).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhanañjaya gave his daughter, as dowry, five hundred carts full of money, five hundred with vessels of gold, five hundred each of silver, copper, various silks, ghee, rice husked and winnowed; also ploughs, ploughshares, and other farm implements, five hundred carts with three slave-women in each, everything being provided for them. The cattle given by him filled an enclosure three quarters of a league in length and eight rods across, standing shoulder to shoulder, and in addition to these, sixty thousand bulls and sixty thousand milk cows escaped from their stalls and joined the herd already gifted to her. In her birth as Sanghadási, she gave the five products of the cow to twenty thousand monks, begging them to eat; hence the escaping of the cattle for her benefit (DhA.i.397). Visákhá's relations continued to send her costly gifts even after her marriage. The Udána (ii.9) contains a story of a dispute she had with the customs officers regarding the duty they levied on one of her presents. She visited Pasenadi several times, trying to get the matter settled; but he had no time to give to the matter, and, in the end, she sought consolation from the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the time came for Visákhá to leave, Dhanañjaya gave her ten admonitions, which Migára overheard from the next room. These admonitions were: Not to give fire from the house outside; not to take into the house fire from without; to give only to those who give in return: not to give to those who do not give in return; to give to him that gives and to him that gives not; to sit, eat and sleep happily; to tend the fire and to honour </data>
<data>household deities. These riddles were later explained by Visákhá to her father in law (DhA.i.403f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the following day Dhanañjaya appointed eight householders to be sponsors to his daughter and to enquire into any charges which might be brought against her. When she left, Dhanañjaya allowed any inhabitants of his fourteen tributary villages to accompany her if they so wished. As a result the villages were left empty; but Migára, fearing that he should have to feed them, drove most of them back. Visákhá entered Sávatthi standing in her chariot, so that all might see her glory. The citizens showered gifts on her, but these she distributed among the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migára was a follower of the Niganthas, and, soon after Visákhá's arrival in his house, he sent for them and told her to minister to them. But Visákhá, repulsed by their nudity, refused to pay them homage. The Niganthas urged that she should be sent away, but Migára bided his time. One day, as Migára was eating, while Visákhá stood fanning him, a monk was seen standing outside his house. Visákhá stood aside, that Migára might see him, but as Migára continued to eat without noticing the monk, she said to the latter, &quot;Pass on, Sir, my father in law eats stale fare.&quot; Migára was angry and threatened to send her away, but, at her request, the matter was referred to her sponsors. They enquired into the several charges brought against her and adjudged her not guilty. Visákhá then gave orders that preparations should be made for her return to her parents. But Migára begged her forgiveness which she granted, on condition that he would invite to the house the Buddha and his monks. This he did, but, owing to the influence of the Niganthas, he left Visákhá to entertain them, and only consented to hear the Buddha's sermon at the end of the meal from behind a curtain. At the conclusion of this sermon, </data>
<data>however, he became a sotápanna. His gratitude towards Visákhá was boundless; henceforth she was to be considered as his mother and to receive all the honour due to a mother; from this time onwards she was called Migáramátá. In DhA.i.406 we are told that in order to confirm this declaration, Migára sucked the breast of Visákhá. This account adds that she had also a son named Migára; thus there was a double reason for the name. AA.i.313 says that Migára was her eldest son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migára got made for her everyday use an ornament called ghanamatthaka, at a cost of one hundred thousand. (Some time after, Visákhá sold the Matálatápasádhana and built the Migáramátupásada.) On the day of the presentation of this ornament, Migára held for her a special festival in her honour, and she was made to bathe in sixteen pots of perfumed water. This account of Visákhá is summarized from DhA.i.384ff.; AA.i.219ff. contains a similar account but with far less detail. The DhA. account contains numerous other particulars, some of which are given below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visákhá had ten sons and ten daughters, each of whom had a similar number of children, and so on down to the fourth generation. Before her death, at the age of one hundred and twenty, she had eighty four thousand and twenty direct lineal descendants, all living. (But see Ud.viii.8, which speaks of the death of a grand daughter and of Visákhá's great grief; this evidently refers to Dattá). She herself kept, all her life, the appearance of a girl of sixteen. She had the strength of five elephants, and it is said that once she took the trunk of an elephant, which was sent to test her, between her two fingers and forced him back on his haunches (DhA.i.409). Visákhá owned such a great reputation for bringing good fortune that the people of Sávatthi always invited her to their houses on festivals and holidays (Ibid.).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Visákhá fed five hundred monks daily at her house. (Thus, e.g., J.iv.144; two thousand, according to DhA.i.128; later she appointed her grand daughter, probably Dattá, to officiate for her.) In the afternoon she visited the Buddha, and, after listening to his sermon, would go round the monastery inquiring into the needs of the monks and nuns (*1). In these rounds she was sometimes accompanied by Suppiyá (*2). Visákhá begged for, and was granted, eight boons by the Buddha: that as long as she lived she be allowed to give robes to the members of the Order for the rainy season; food for monks coming into Sávatthi (*3); food for those going out; food for the sick; food for those who wait on the sick; medicine for the sick; a constant supply of rice gruel for any needing it; and bathing robes for the nuns (*4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the construction of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada')"&gt;Mígáramátupásáda&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.) in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pubbarama')"&gt;Pubbáráma&lt;/a&gt; Visákhá's ambitions were fulfilled, and it is said (DhA.i.416f) that when the monastery was completed and the festival of opening in progress, as the evening drew on she walked round the monastery accompanied by her children, her grandchildren and her great grandchildren, and in five stanzas sang her joy, saying, &quot;Now is entirely fulfilled the prayer which I prayed in times of yore.&quot; (The wishes mentioned in these stanzas as having been fulfilled differ from the eight boons mentioned above). The monks heard her sing and told the Buddha; he related to them how, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Visákhá had been the friend of the principal women benefactors of that Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was Sanghadásí, youngest of the seven daughters of Kiki, and for long after her marriage she gave alms and performed other good works with her sisters. (AA.i.219).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*1) Because she wished the Sangha well she was   appointed on the committee set up to enquire into the charge of misbehaviour   brought against the mother of Kumárakassapa (q.v.); Visákhá's experience as   the mother of several children stood her in good stead.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*2) For an incident connected with one of these visits,   see Suppiyá. DhA. (i. 100f.) says that once five hundred young men of good   family entrusted the care of their wives to Visákhá. On one occasion, when   accompanying her to the monastery, they became drunk and committed   improprieties in the presence of the Buddha. The Buddha frightened them by   emitting a dark blue ray of light, thus restoring them to their senses. This   was the occasion of the preaching of the Kumbha Játaka; see also J.v.11f.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*3) Probably on account of this boon the monks who had   been to see Khadiravaniya Revata (q.v.) visited Visákhá immediately after   their return to Sávatthi; but see the Pítha Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*4) This list of boons and Visákhá’s reasons for   begging them are given at Vin.i.290ff. According to the Suruci Játaka (q.v.),   she obtained the boons owing to her virtue in the past as well     e.g., in her birth as Sumedhá (J.iv.315ff.); see also Vin.i.296, where the   Buddha accepts a face towel as a special gift from Visákhá but would not   accept an earthenware foot scrubber (Vin.ii.129f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Viháravimánavatthu (Vv.iv.6; VvA.189,191), Visákhá was born, after death, among the Nimmánaratidevá as the consort of the deva king Sunimmita.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.740) that Visákhá, like Sakka and Anáthapindika, will enjoy one hundred and thirty one kappas of happiness in the Brahma-worlds before she finally passes away into nibbána.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Among Visákhá's relations are also mentioned, in addition to her two sons Migajála and Migára, a sister Sujátá, who became Anáthapindika’s daughter in law (A.iv.91; AA.ii.724; J.ii.347); a grandson, Salha (q.v.); a granddaughter, Dattá, who died (DhA.iii.278): and Uggaha (q.v.), called Mendakanattá. Mention is also made of a grandson of hers on whose behalf she interceded with the Buddha when the monks refused to ordain him during the rainy season. (Vin.i.153)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books contain numerous suttas preached by the Buddha to Visákhá during her frequent visits to him, chief among such suttas being the famous discourse on the keeping of the uposatha, (A.i.205ff.; cf.iv.255; DhA.iii.58f) the discourse of the eight qualities which win for women power in this world and power and happiness in the next, (A.iv.269) and eight qualities which win for a woman birth among the Manápakáyika devas. (A.iv.267)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Visákhá&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the women who will renounce the world at the same time as the future Buddha Metteyya. She will be accompanied by eighty four thousand other women. Anágat. vs. 63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Visákha. &lt;/b&gt;Husband of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammadinnaa')"&gt;Dhammadinná&lt;/a&gt;. He was a rich merchant of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; on his visit to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, who was then at Rájagaha for the first time after his Enlightenment. Visákha, on that occasion, became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;, after hearing the Buddha preach; he later became a sakadágámí and then an anágámí. After he became an anágámí his behaviour to his wife completely changed, and when he explained to her the reason, offering her all his wealth and freedom to do as she wished, she asked his leave to join the Order. Visákha informed Bimbisára of her wish, and, at his request, the king ordered that the city be decked in her honour on the day of her renunciation and that she be taken to the nunnery in a golden palanquin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Dhammadinná had joined the Order, she left the city and retired into the country, returning to Rájagaha after she had attained arahantship. Visákha, hearing of her return, visited her at the nunnery and asked her various questions regarding the Buddha's teachings, all of which she answered (MA.i.514f.; ThigA.15, 19). Their conversation is recorded in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_vedalla_s')"&gt;Culla Vedalla Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.299f.; cf. DhA.iv.229f.; AA.i.197). Visákha then visited the Buddha and reported their conversation to him, winning the Buddha's praises for Dhammadinná.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Phussa Buddha, Visákha and Dhammadinná had been husband and wife. (For details see PvA.20ff.; of. KhpA.202f.; DhA.i.86f. AA.i.144f.) Visákha had been the treasurer, appointed by the three sons of </data>
<data>Jayasena, in charge of the provisions given by them for the almsgiving held in honour of Phussa Buddha and his monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visákha is mentioned (SA.iii.223) as one of the seven lay disciples in the time of the Buddha who had each five hundred followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Visákha. &lt;/b&gt;Called Pañcáliputta. He was son of a provincial governor (mandalikarájá) of Magadha, and was called Pañcáliputta because his mother was the daughter of the Pañcála king. (AA.ii.511 calls him the son of Pañcálibráhmaní). He succeeded his father, and, hearing one day that the Buddha had arrived near his village, he visited him, heard him preach and joined the Order. He then accompanied the Buddha to Sávatthi, where he became an arahant. Later, out of compassion, he visited his relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day he was asked how many qualities were necessary to a man in order that he should be considered a skilful preacher of the Dhamma. Visákha's answer is included in the Theragáthá (Thag. vs. 209 10; ThagA.i.331f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen kappas ago he was a poor householder, and one day, while searching in the forest for fruit, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and offered him a vallí fruit. He is evidently to be identified with Valliphaladáyaka of the Apadána (Ap.i.296).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visákha was evidently a clever and arresting preacher, and the books mention that the Buddha heard him preach and praised him. S.ii.280; A.ii.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Visákha Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was a rich householder of Pátaliputta who, hearing that there were many shrines in Ceylon, made over his property to his family and left home with one single coin wrapt in the hem of his garment. He had to spend one month at the port waiting for a ship, and, during that time, made one thousand by his skill in trade. Arrived at the </data>
<data>Mahávihára, he asked to be ordained, and when, at the time of his ordination, the money was discovered, he distributed it among those who were present. After five years he set out travelling, and, with the help of a devatá, found his way to Cittalapabbata vihára, where he stayed for four months. As he was about to leave, the devatá of the jambu tree which stood at the head of his cankamana appeared before him weeping, and explained that while the Thera was there the nonhumans lived in peace, but that when he had gone they would start quarrelling and talking loudly. Several times he tried to leave but was thus prevented, until, at last, he became an arahant and died there. Vsm.i.312f; the story is referred to at AA.ii.865.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

Vimala Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a rich family of Rájagaha and received his name because he was born free of all dirt. Much impressed by the majesty of the Buddha when the latter visited Rájagaha, Vimala entered the Order, and lived in a mountain cave in Kosala. One day a vast cloud spread over the sky; rain fell, allaying the heat and discomfort, and Vimala, concentrating his mind, attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a family of conch blowers in the time of Vipassí Buddha, and one day honoured the Buddha by playing on his conch shell. He bathed the Bodhi tree of Kassapa Buddha with fragrant water and washed the seats and the clothes of holy monks. Twenty four kappas ago he was king six times, under the name of Mahánigghosa. ThagA.i.121f; his Udána verse is included in Thag.vs.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vimala Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was born in a brahmin family of Benares and entered the Order under Somamitta Thera, who encouraged him to attain arahantship. In the story of Somamitta, however, Vimala is said to have been his teacher. For details see Somamitta. In the days of Padumuttara Buddha he was a householder, and, when the Buddha's body was being carried to the pyre for cremation, amidst impressive celebrations, he offered sumana flowers in his honour.

When Vijayabáhu IV. became king, Vírabáhu lived at court, helped the king in his duties as a devoted friend and was constantly in his company.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Vidúdabha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa')"&gt;Vásabhakhattiyá&lt;/a&gt;. On the birth of Vidúdabha, the king, glad at having a son, sent word to his own grandmother asking her to choose a name. The minister who delivered the message was deaf, and when the grandmother spoke of Vásabhakhattiyá as being dear to the king, mistook &quot;vallabha&quot; for &quot;Vidúdabha,&quot; and, thinking that this was an old family name, bestowed it on the prince. When the boy was quite young, Pasenadi conferred on him the rank of senápati, thinking that this would please the Buddha. It was for the same reason he married Vásabhakhattiyá; both in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/piyajatika_sutta')"&gt;Piyajátika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.110) and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kannakatthala_s')"&gt;Kannakatthala Suttas&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.127) Vidúdabha is spoken of as senápati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Vidúdabha was seven years old, he wished to visit his maternal grandparents, hoping to be given presents, like his companions by theirs, but Vásabhakhattiyá persuaded him against this, telling him that they lived too far away. But he continued to express this desire, and when he reached the age of sixteen she consented to his going. Thereupon, accompanied by a large retinue, he set out for Kapilavatthu. The Sákiyans sent all the younger princes away, there being thus none to pay obeisance to him in answer to his salute, the remaining ones being older than he. He was shown every hospitality and stayed for several days. On the day of his departure, one of his retinue overheard a contemptuous remark passed by a slave woman who was washing, with milk and water, the seat on which Vidúdabha had sat. This was reported to him, and, having discovered the deceit which had been practiced on his father, he vowed </data>
<data>vengeance on the Sákiyans. Pasenadi cut off all honours from Vásabhakhattiyá and her son, but restored them later, at the Buddha's suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Pasenadi’s death, which was brought about by the treachery of Díghakáráyana in making Vidúdabha king (for details see Pasenadi), Vidúdabha remembered his oath, and set out with a large army for Kapilavatthu. The Buddha, aware of this, stood under a tree, with scanty shade, just within the boundaries of the Sákiyan kingdom. On the boundary was a banyan which gave deep shade. Vidúdabha, seeing the Buddha, asked him to sit under the banyan. &quot;Be not worried,&quot; said the Buddha, &quot;the shade of my kinsmen keeps me cool.” Vidúdabha understood and returned home with his army. This exposure to the sun gave the Buddha a headache which lasted through out his life (UdA.265; Ap.i.300).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three times he marched against the Sákiyans and three times he saw the Buddha under the same tree and turned back. The fourth time the Buddha knew that the fate of the Sákiyans could not be averted and remained away. In a previous existence they had conspired and thrown poison into a river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sákiyans went armed into the battle, but not wishing to kill, they shot their arrows into Vidúdabha's ranks without killing anyone. On this being brought to Vidúdabha's notice, he gave orders that all the Sákiyans, with the exception of the followers of the Sákiyan Mahánáma, should be slain. The Sákiyans stood their ground, some with blades of grass and some with reeds. These were spared, and came to be known as Tinasákyá and Nalasákiyá respectively.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The others were all killed, even down to the infants. Mahánáma was taken prisoner and went back with Vidúdabha, who wished him to share his meal. But Mahánáma said he wished to bathe, and plunged into a lake </data>
<data>with the idea of dying rather than eating with a slave woman's child. The Nágas of the lake, however, saved him and took him to the Nága world. That same night Vidúdabha pitched his camp on the dry bed of the Aciravatí. Some of his men lay on the banks, others on the river bed. Some of those who lay on the river bed were not guilty of sin in their past lives, while some who slept on the bank were. Ants appeared on the ground where the sinless ones lay, and they changed their sleeping places. During the night there was a sudden flood, and Vidúdabha and those of his retinue who slept in the river bed were washed into the sea. This account is taken from DhA.i.346 9, 357 61; but see also J.i.133 and iv.146f., 151f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;* According to Chinese records, Vidúdabha took five hundred Sákyan maidens into his harem, but they refused to submit to him and abused him and his family. He ordered them to be killed, their hands and feet to be cut off, and their bodies thrown into a ditch. The Buddha sent a monk to preach to them, and they were reborn after death in heaven. Sakra collected their bones and burnt them (Beal, op. cit.ii.11f.). The eleventh Pallava of the Avadánakalpalatá has a similar story. Vidúdabha killed seventy seven thousand Sákiyans and stole eighty thousand boys and girls. The girls were rude to him, and he ordered their death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Samyutta Nikáya mentions a lady of the gotta living in Kámandá, who was evidently a teacher. A pupil of hers (antevásí máttavaka) having visited Udáyi, then staying in the Todeyya ambavana, told her of his excellences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was asked to invite Udáyí to a meal, and, when it was over, the teacher put on her sandals, sat on a high seat, and, with her head veiled, asked Udáyí to preach the doctrine. &quot;A time will come for that, sister,&quot; he said, and went away. Three times this happened, and then she told her pupil. He pointed out to her her mistake in not showing respect for the Doctrine. The next time Udáyí came, she approached him after the meal with all humility and asked him what, according to the arahants, was the cause of weal and woe. &quot;The existence of the senses,&quot; answered Udáyí; and she, expressing her satisfaction, declared herself a follower of Udáyí.

On his way to see the Buddha he died, and was reborn in the deva world. (ThagA.i.295f.; two verses attributed to him are given in Thag.169 70).

In the time of Atthadassí Buddha he was a hermit and gave the Buddha some fruit (ThagA.i.424f).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Verañjá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town in which the Buddha once spent the rainy season at the invitation of the brahmin Verañja. (In the twelfth year, according to Buddhaghosa   e.g., AA.ii.758; cf. BuA.3). Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Nalerupicumanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tathágata were so to honour anyone, that person's head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the Buddha’s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there. Here he spoke of the Vijjáttaya, says UdA.(p. 183), because all the monks with the Buddha were chalabhiññá, and therefore no special mention was needed of abhiññá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttarápatha, staying at Verañjá, supplied the monks with food. Moggallána proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this stay Sáriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them -  Vipassí, Sikhí and Vesabhú-  did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality. Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in </data>
<data>the house. The Commentators add that Verañja forgot his invitation because Mára, being in a spiteful mood, had taken possession of him and of all the inhabitants of Verañja (Sp.i.178 L; DhA.ii.153; cf. J.iii.494).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha and a pair to each of the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Verañjá the Buddha went to Benares, passing through Soreyya, Sankassa and Kannakujja, and crossing the Ganges at Payágapatitthána. From Benares he proceeded to Vesáli. This account, of the Buddha's visit to Verañja, forms the introduction to the Vinaya and is found at Vin.iii.1 11. The interview with Verañja is given at A.iv.172ff. The road taken by the Buddha from Verañjá to Benares was, according to Buddhaghosa (Sp.i.201), the shortest, and the Buddha knew the monks were tired after their experiences in Verañjá. Soon after, he appears to have visited Kapilavatthu. There he was visited by Mahánáma, the Sákyan, who asked permission to entertain him and the monks for four months that they might recover their strength. At the end of the four months he renewed his request, and thus looked after the monks for a whole year. It was this act that won for him the title of aggo panítadáyakánam (A.A.i.213).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (SNA.i.154; Mil. 232) that the devas put flavour (ojá) into every mouthful of food taken by the Buddha at Verañjá. According to the Apadána (Ap.i.301; ApA.i.103f.; cf. UdA.265), the Bodhisatta was born of a noble house in the time of Phussa Buddha, and, once, seeing the monks eating good food, he had reviled them and asked them to eat oats (yava). It was for this reason the Buddha was condemned to eat yava during three months at Verañjá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A road led from Verañjá to Madhurá, and the Anguttara </data>
<data>Nikáya (A.ii.57f) contains a sermon preached by the Buddha to a large number of people while he rested by the roadside. There was evidently frequent intercourse between Sávatthi and Verañjá, and the Verañjaka Sutta (q.v.) was preached to some brahmins who visited the Buddha at Sávatthi, whither they had gone on business. The books also record (A.iv.198f ) a visit paid by the Asura Paháráda to the Buddha at Verañjá. The Válodaka Játaka (q.v.) and the Cullasuka Játaka (q.v.) were preached soon after the Buddha's return from Verañjá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He gave for her use one of the eight loads of water brought for him from Anotatta (Mhv.v.85; two says Sp.i.42). She was a faithful follower of the Buddha's teaching and died in the thirtieth year of Asoka's reign (Mhv.xx.2). When preparations were being made to take the branch of the Bodhi-tree to Ceylon, she offered to the tree all kinds of ornaments and various sweet-scented flowers (Mbv.152).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having learnt from the monks that the voice of the karavíka bird was like that of the Buddha, she had a karavíka given her by the king, and listened to his song. Thrilled with joy at the thought of the sweetness of the Buddha's voice, she attained to the First Fruit of the Path (DA.ii.453; MA.ii.771).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was called Asandhimittá because the joints in her limbs were visible only when she bent or stretched them (MT.136).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous birth, when Asoka was born as a honey merchant and gave honey to the Pacceka Buddha, she was the maid who pointed out the honey-store to the Pacceka Buddha. She had then wished that she might become the queen consort of the King of Jambudípa and be possessed of a lovely form with invisible joints. Mhv.v.59-60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Arindama.&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta, born as King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and son of the Magadha King of Rájagaha. During the time of Sikhí Buddha he held a great almsgiving for the Buddha and his monks; he presented to the Order a fully caparisoned elephant which he redeemed by giving suitable gifts to the height of an elephant (J.i.41; Bu.xxi.9). He had as friend the chaplain's son, Sonaka. They both studied in Takkasilá and at the conclusion of their studies they travelled about in search of experience. In the course of their travels Arindama was elected to succeed the King of Benares who had died childless, and Sonaka became a Pacceka Buddha. Forty years later Arindama wished to see Sonaka, but no one could tell him his whereabouts in spite of the offer of a large reward. Ten years later Sonaka saw the king through the good offices of a lad of seven, who belonged to the harem and had learnt a song composed by the king expressing his desire to meet Sonaka. At the meeting, however, the king failed to recognise him. Sonaka, not revealing his identity, spoke to the king about the joys of renunciation, and disappeared through the air. The king, moved by his words, decided to give up the throne and to follow the ascetic life. He appointed his eldest son Díghávu king in his stead, handed over to him all his possessions, and developing supernatural faculties was born in the Brahma world (J.v.247-61).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arindama is mentioned together with Mahájanaka as an example of a king who renounced a mighty kingdom to lead a hermit's life (J.iii.489). The story also appears in the Mahávastu (iii.449ff), but the details given differ from those of the Játaka version. There Arindama is spoken of as the King of Mithilá.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;In both accounts Díghávu's mother, the king's chief queen, is spoken of as having died before the king's renunciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.203), Arindama's capital was Paribhuttanagara. (v.l. Arindamaka.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Arindama.&lt;/b&gt;-King in the time of Sumana Buddha. A great dispute had arisen at this time regarding nirodha and all the inhabitants of many thousand world systems were divided into two camps. In order to settle their doubts, the disputants, with Arindama at their head, sought the Buddha. The Buddha sat on Mount Yugandhara while Arindama, with his ninety thousand crores of followers, sat on a golden rock, which by the power of his merit had sprung from the earth near Sankassa. The Buddha preached to them, and at the end of the sermon they all became arahants. BuA.128-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Arindama.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Uttara. When Revata Buddha visited his city the king went to see him, accompanied by three crores of people. The next day a great almsgiving was held for the Buddha and the monks, and also a festival of light covering a space of three leagues. The Buddha preached to the assembly, and one thousand crores of people realised the Truth. Bu.vi.4; BuA.133.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Aruna&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Aruna.-A khattiya, father of Sikhí Buddha and husband of Pabhávatí (Bu.xxi.15; J.i.41; AA.i.436). Aruna's chief queen became the Therí Abhayá in the present age (ThigA.41). Another of his wives became, in her last life, the Therí Somá (ThigA.66), who is perhaps to be identified with Uppaladáyiká of the Apadána (Ap.ii.601f). In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.155) he is called Arunavá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Aruna.-The Assaka king of Potali in the Assaka country. (In the main story the king's name is given as Assaka, but the scholiast says his real name was Aruna). The Kálinga king of that time, longing for a fight, but finding no one willing to accept his challenge, at last devised a plan. He sent his four beautiful daughters, in a covered carriage and with an armed escort to the various cities in the neighbourhood, proclaiming that any king, who took them as wives, would have to fight their father. No one was found willing to take the risk till they came to Potali in the Assaka country. Even the Assaka king at first merely sent them a present by way of courtesy, but his minister, Nandisena, fertile in expedients, urged the king to marry them, saying that he himself would undertake to face the consequences. The Kálinga king at once set out with his army. On his way to Potali, he came across the Bodhisatta, who was leading the ascetic life and, without revealing his identity, consulted him regarding his chances of success in the fight. The Bodhisatta promised that he would see Sakka about it the next day and, having done so, informed the king that the Kálinga forces would win. Nandisena heard of this prophecy but, nothing daunted, he gathered together the Assaka forces and all their allies; then, by a well-planned manoeuvre, he managed to have the </data>
<data>tutelary deity of Kálinga (who was fighting for the Kálinga king) killed by Assaka. Thereupon the Kálinga king was routed and fled. The Bodhisatta, finding that his prophecy had turned out false, sought Sakka in his distress; Sakka consoled him thus: &quot;Hast thou never heard that even the gods favour the bold hero of intrepid resolve, who never yields?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, at the suggestion of Nandisena, the Assaka king demanded of Kálinga's ruler dowry for his four daughters, and the Kálinga king acceded to his request. The story is told in the Kálinga Játaka (J.iii.3ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.

Aruna.-The name of the lotus that grows in the Nága world. It was one of Uppalavanná's wishes to have a body of the colour of the Aruna-lotus. Ap.ii.554(v.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Aruna.-A class of devas present at the preaching of the Mahá-Samaya Sutta. They were of diverse hue, of wondrous gifts, mighty powers, comely and with splendid following. D.ii.260.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Anusásika Játaka (No. 115)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Jetavana regarding a gluttonous sister, who sought alms in quarters unvisited by other sisters. In order to keep these areas for herself she warned others of dangers lurking there. One day, while begging for alms, her leg was broken by a ram, and her secret discovered. The story of the past is of a greedy bird, which, after cunningly warning others against the dangers of the road in which she found food, is herself crushed to death by a carriage on that same road. The sister is identified with the bird. J.i.428-30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Assaláyana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young brahmin, sixteen years old, of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, very learned in the Vedas and allied subjects. Five hundred brahmins staying in the city asked him to hold a discussion with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; and refute his views. He agreed only after repeated requests, because, he said, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt; was a thinker with views of his own and, therefore, difficult to defeat in controversy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He visits the Buddha and asks what he has to say concerning the claims of the brahmins to be the only superior class, the legitimate sons of Brahma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The Buddha points out to him that such pretensions are baseless, and that virtue, which alone leads to purity, can be cultivated by &lt;b&gt;any&lt;/b&gt; of the four classes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assaláyana sits silent and upset at the end of the discourse, but when the Buddha relates to him a story of the past where &lt;a href="asita_devala')"&gt;Asita Devala&lt;/a&gt; had defeated brahmins who held these same views, Assaláyana feels relieved and expresses his admiration of the Buddha's exposition. He declares himself a follower of the Buddha (M.ii.147ff). Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.785) tells us further that Assaláyana became a devoted follower of the faith and built a cetiya in his own residence for worship, and that all his descendants, down to Buddhaghosa's day, built similar cetiyas in their houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assaláyana is probably to be identified with the father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kotthita')"&gt;Mahákotthita&lt;/a&gt;, his wife being Candavati. There is, however, one difficulty connected with this theory: Mahákotthita says that he was won over to the faith after hearing the same sermon of the Buddha as </data>
<data>converted his father (yadá me pitaram Buddho vinayí sabbasuddhiyá) (ThagA.i.31; Ap.ii.480). It is unlikely, if the identification be correct, that this refers to the Assaláyana Sutta, because at the time of that Sutta, Assaláyana was only sixteen years old; but there exists no record of any other sutta preached to Assaláyana, dealing with &quot;sabbasuddhi.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assalayána's name occurs in a list of eminent brahmins found in the Sutta-Nipáta Commentary (i.372).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assaláyana Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Records the conversation   between the Buddha and  Assaláyana when the latter went to visit him.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ariyapariyesaná Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached in Sávatthi in the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka. Some monks expressed to Ananda their desire to hear a discourse from the Buddha, as it was so long since they had heard one. He advised them to go to the hermitage of Rammaka where their wishes might be fulfilled. The noontide of that same day Amanda spent with the Buddha at the Pubbáráma in the Migáramátupásáda and in the evening, after the Buddha had bathed in the Pubbakotthaka, Ananda suggested to him that he might go to Rammaka's hermitage. The Buddha assenting, they went together. The Buddha, finding the monks engaged in discussing the Doctrine, waited till their discussion was over. Having inquired the topic thereof, he praised them and proceeded to tell them of the two quests in the world-the noble and the ignoble. He described how he, too, before his Enlightenment, had followed the quest, apprenticing himself to various teachers, such as Áláva-Káláma and Uddaka Rámaputta, and how, on discovering that they could not give him what he sought, he went to Uruvelá and there found the consummate peace of Nibbána. This biographical account is also found in the Mahá-Saccaka, Bodhirájakumára and Sangárava-Suttas. It is in part repeated in the Vinaya and the Digha Nikáya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta then proceeds to give an account of the Buddha's first reluctance to preach, of Sahampati's intervention, of the meeting with the Ájivaka Upaka and the first sermon preached to the Pañcavaggiyas. Finally the sutta expounds the pleasures of the senses, the dangers therefrom and the freedom and confidence which ensue when one has overcome desire (M.i.160-75).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Commentary (MA.i.369ff) the sutta is called Pásarási, evidently because of the simile found at the end of the </data>
<data>discourse where the pleasures of the senses are compared to baited traps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atthasáliní quotes it (p.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Asokamálá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wife of Prince Sáli. She was a candála woman of exceedingly great beauty, and the prince married her, thus renouncing his right to the throne (Mhv.xxiii.2-4). The two had been husband and wife, named Tissa and Nagá, in a previous existence and had lived in Mundagangá in Ceylon. One day the husband received a pig from a hunter in payment of some smith's work he had done. Having prepared the animal for food, he expressed the wish that eight holy monks might come to accept alms from him. His wife joining him in this wish, they decorated the house, prepared eight seats, strewed the village path with sand and awaited the guests. Dhammadinna Thera of Piyangudípa, having divined the man's wish, came to the village with seven colleagues. After they had eaten, they gave thanks and went away. The man was born as Sáli the son of Dutthagámani, but his wife was born as a candála as punishment for an offence in another existence. She had been the youngest of seven daughters of a carpenter and was one day scolded by her mother for untidiness. In anger she used to her mother the same abusive terms as had been hurled at her. This undutiful behaviour caused her to be born as the daughter of a candála. MT.606 f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her name was Deví, and her father was the chief candála in Hallolagáma. Her story is given at great length in Ras.ii.117f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

After his education at Takkasilá his parents wished him to marry. After much persuasion he agreed to do so, if they could find a woman like a golden image which he would make. Emissaries were sent out and they found a girl of sixteen, Samíllabhásiní, in the Kási kingdom. She did not wish to marry either, but yielded to her parent's wishes. Though the two young people were married they lived in celibacy and when their parents died they gave away their immense wealth and became ascetics. Samillabhásini died of dysentery caused by unsatisfactory meals. The Bodhisatta coming back from his begging-rounds found her dead on a bench, but proceeded to eat his meal much to the surprise of the onlookers. On being questioned, &quot;Why should I weep?&quot; he said &quot;that which has the quality of dissolution is dissolved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a landowner who, when his wife died, gave himself up to despair. The Buddha, seeing his upanissaya, went out to meet him and told him the story, whereupon he obtained the First Fruit of the Path. J.iii.92-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Anabhirati Játaka (No. 65).&lt;/b&gt;-Women cannot be regarded as private property. They are common to all; they extend universal hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a famous teacher of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. A pupil of his, finding his wife unfaithful, was so affected by the discovery that he kept away from classes. When asked why, he told his teacher the whole story; the latter consoled him by telling him that all women were unfaithful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to an upásaka who came to visit the Buddha. Once, on discovering his wife's faithlessness, he had words with her and kept away from the vihára. J.i.301-2; see also DhA.iii.348ff., where the details given are slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Anabhirati Játaka (No. 185).&lt;/b&gt;-Told to a young brahmin of Sávatthi who knew the three Vedas by heart. When he married his mind became darkened. He visited the Buddha, who talked to him pleasantly and discovered in the course of conversation that his memory had grown weak. The same thing had happened to him in the past, said the Buddha. Serenity of mind is essential for good memory. J.ii.99-101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Angirasa &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Angirasa (Angírasa).-A name applied to the Buddha several times in the Pitakas. (E.g., Vin.i.25; D.iii.196; S.i.196; A.iii.239; Thag.v.536; J.i.116). In the Commentaries three etymologies are given: Buddhaghosa says that &quot;it means emitting rays of various hues from the body,&quot; and that the word is therefore applicable to all Buddhas alike (DA.iii.963). Dhammapála adds that it signifies being possessed of attainments such as virtue, and also that according to some, Angirasa was a personal name given by the Buddha's father in addition to Siddhatha (ThagA.i.503. It is worth noting that in AA.i.381 Siddhattha is referred to as Angírasa Kumára.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, however, well-known that, according to Vedic tradition, the Gautamas belong to the Angirasa tribe (see Vedic Index: Gotama); the word, as applied to the Buddha, therefore, is probably a patronymic, in which case we have another example of a Ksatriya tribe laying claim to a brahmin gotra. See Thomas: Life and Legend of the Buddha, p.22-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Angirasa.-Another name (Angirasa gahapati) for Asayha. Pv.p.25, vv.23 and &lt;st1:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="27 ff"&gt;27 ff&lt;/st1:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;.; also PvA.124.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Angirasa.-One of the ten ancient seers who conducted great sacrifices and were versed in Vedic lore. The others being Atthaka, Vámaka, Vámadeva, Vessámitta, Yamataggi, Bháradvája, Vásettha, Kassapa and Bhagu. The list occurs in several places, e.g. Vin.i.245; A.iii.224; M.ii.169, 200. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same ten are also mentioned as being composers and reciters of the Vedas. D.i.238.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Angirasa.-A celebrated physician </data>
<data>(Mil.272). Rhys Davids suggests that the connection of the name Angirasa with the physician is due to the charms against disease to be found in the Atharva Veda. Mil. trans. ii.109, n. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Angirasa.-A king, mentioned among the descendants of Mahásammata. Mhv.ii.4; and Dpv.iii.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Angirasa.-An ascetic. The name occurs in a list of eleven ascetics who, because of their holy lives, passed the Peta world and were born in Brahma's heaven (J.vi.99; J.v.267). For the others see Akitti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Angirasa.-An ascetic, Angírasa Gotama, who was killed by the thousand-armed Ajjuna. The ascetic disturbed the animals when Ajjuna was waiting to hunt, and the king, in anger, shot at him with a poisoned arrow (J.v.135, 144 and 145; DA.i.266). This Angírasa is probably to be identified with one of the foregoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was born in Sobhana in the Sucindhanu pleasaunce, his parents being Ságara and Sudassaná (Bu.xv.; BuA.178ff). He was so called because at his birth people recovered long-buried treasures. His wife was Visákhá and his son Sena (Sela according to the Buddhavamsa Commentary). He lived for 10,000 years as a householder in three palaces - Amaragiri, Suragiri and Giriváhana. He left home on a horse called Sudassana. His penance lasted eight months, and his meal of milk-rice was given by a nága woman, Sucindhará. A nága, Dhammaruci, gave him the grass which he spread at the foot of the campaka tree, where he reached Enlightenment. His first sermon was preached in the Anomá-park near Anoma. His chief disciples were Santa, the king's son, and Upasanta, son of the chaplain of Sucandaka. His chief women disciples were Dhammá and Sudhammá. Abhaya was his attendant, and his patrons were Nakula and Nisabha among the laymen, and Makilá and Sunandá among the lay-women. The Bodhisatta was a jatila, Susíma of Campaka, and he offered the Buddha a canopy of flowers brought from the deva-world. Atthadassí died at the age of 100,000 years at Anomáráma in Anupama and his relics were scattered in various places. He appeared in the Mandakappa, in the company of two others, Piyadassí and Dhammadassí. J.i.39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Atthadassí. A Thera in Ceylon who, in company with two others, Buddhamitta and Buddhadeva, asked that the Játakatthakatha be written (J.i.1; Gv.68). He was probably an incumbent of the Mahávihara in Anurádhapura. See Páli Lit. of Ceylon, 125.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Anotatta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Anotatta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the seven great lakes of Himavá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The others being Kannamunda, Rathakára, Chaddanta, Kunála, Mandákiní and Síhappapáta. It is surrounded by five mountain peaks, Sudassanakúta, Citrakúta, Kálakúta, Gandhamádana and Kelása.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudassanakúta is concave, shaped like a crow's beak and overshadows the whole lake, which is hidden also by the other peaks. The lake is 150 leagues long, 50 leagues wide and 50 leagues deep. All the rains that fall on the five peaks and all the rivers that rise in them flow into the lake. The light of the sun and of the moon never falls directly on the, water but only in reflection. This means that the water is always cool, hence the name.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many bathing places are found therein free from fish and tortoises, with crystal clear waters, where Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas and arahants bathe, and whither devas and yakkhas come for sport. Four channels open out of the lake in the direction of the four quarters: Síhamukha, Hatthimukha, Assamukha and Usabhamukha. Lions abound on the banks of the Síhamukha; elephants, horses and cattle respectively on the others. Four rivers flow from these channels; the eastward river encircles the lake three times, waters the non-human regions of Himavá and enters the ocean. The rivers that flow north and westward flow in those directions through regions inhabited by non-humans and also enter the ocean. The southward river, like the eastward, flows three times round the lake and then straight south over a rocky channel for sixty leagues and then down a precipice, forming a cascade six miles in width. For sixty leagues the water dashes through the air on to a rock named </data>
<data>Tiyaggala, whereon by the force of the impact of the waters the Tiyaggalapokkharani has been formed, fifty leagues deep. From this lake the waters run through a rocky chasm for sixty leagues, then underground for sixty leagues to an oblique mountain, Vijjha, where the stream divides into five, like the fingers of the hand. The part of this river which encircles the original lake Anotatta is called Ávattagangá; the sixty leagues of stream which run over the rocky channel, Kanhagangá; the sixty leagues of waterfall in the air, Ákásagangá; the sixty leagues flowing out of the Tiyaggala-pokkharaní and through the rocky gorge is called Bahalagangá, and the river underground, Ummaggagangá. The five streams into which the river is divided after leaving the oblique mountain Vijjha are called Gangá, Yamuná, Aciravatí, Sarabhú and Mahí (SnA.ii.407; 437-9; MA.ii.585f.; AA.ii.759-60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wind called Siñcanakaváta (sprinkling wind) takes water from the Anotatta lake and sprinkles the Gandhamádana mountain with it (SnA.i.66). The lake is one of the last to dry up at the end of the world (A.iv.101). To be bathed in the waters of the lake is to be thoroughly cleansed. Thus the Buddha's mother, on the day of her conception, dreamt that she had been taken to the lake and had bathed there. This was interpreted to mean that she would give birth to a holy son (MA.ii.918).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During periods when the world does not possess a Buddha, the Pacceka Buddhas, who dwell in Gandhamádana, come amongst men and wash their faces in the lake before starting on their aerial journey for Isipatana (MA.i.386) or elsewhere (E.g., J.iii.319, iv.368). The Buddha would often go to Anotatta for his ablutions and proceed from there to Uttarakuru for alms, returning to the lake to have his meal and spend the hot part of the day on its banks. E.g., before his visit to Uruvelakassapa (Vin.i.28); and again </data>
<data>during the three months he spent in Távatimsa (DhA.iii.222); see also J.i.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples are given of other holy men doing the same. E.g., Mátangapandita, J.iv.379; see also DhA.ii.211.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many bathing-places in the lake; those for the Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, monks, ascetics, the Four Regent gods and other inhabitants of the deva-worlds, and for the goddesses, were all separate from each other. In the bathing-place of the goddesses there once arose a dispute between Kálakanní and Sirí as to which should bathe first (J.iii.257ff). Other instances are given of goddesses bathing in the lake and resting on the banks of the Manosilátala next to it (E.g., J.v.392).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was considered the summit of iddhi-power to be able to obtain water from Anotatta. Thus, when the Buddha wished to make known the great powers of Sumana-Sámanera, he expressed a desire to have water fetched from the lake in which to wash his feet; no one was willing or able to fetch it except the novice Sumana (DhA.iv.134ff). And Sona, to show his iddhi to the 101 kings who escorted his brother Nanda to his hermitage, brought water from Anotatta for them and for their retinue (J.v.320-1). To provide water from the lake for the personal use of some eminent person is considered one of the best ways of showing him esteem. Thus, when a friendship was established between the king of the swans, Javahamsa, and the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, the former brought the famous water from Anotatta to the king for his ablutions (J.iv.213). Pannaka, the Nága king of Anotatta, promised to supply water to Sumana-Sámanera as amends for his earlier discourtesy (DhA.iv.134, also ThagA.457 where the story is given in detail); and Nanda, when he wished to ask his brother's forgiveness for disobedience, thought it a good </data>
<data>way of showing his repentance to bring him water from the lake (J.v.314). This water had curative powers; Anuruddha's abdominal affliction was cured by its use (DhA.iv.129). To be able to use water from Anotatta daily was a great luxury and a sign of real prosperity. Gods brought to Asoka eight pingo-loads of lake water in sixteen pots for his use (Sp.i.42; Mhv.v.24; 84; xi.30). Vessavana employed yakkhinis to fetch water for him in turn, each turn lasting for four to five months. It was exhausting work and some of them died before their term of service was over (DhA.i.40).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular assemblies of the devas and yakkhas were held on the banks of Anotatta, at which contests of skill took place (E.g, among the daughters of Vessavana, demonstrating their ability to dance, VvA.131-2). Sometimes the Buddha would go there with a company of monks and preach or make proclamations (E.g., Ap.i.299). Monks would often dwell there in meditation and come when summoned (Dvy.399).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mahá-kappa is measured by reckoning the amount of time that would be required to empty the Anotatta lake, by dipping into it a blade of kusa-grass, and shaking out from it one drop of water once in every hundred years (PvA.254).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the water of Anotatta, having ultimately entered the ocean through the Ganges, would never turn back, so the Bodhisatta, in his last birth, would never turn back from his purpose of becoming Buddha for the sake of becoming a cakkavatti (Mil.286-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Divyavadana speaks of a class of devas who dwelt near Anotatta, whom it calls Anavatapta-káyikádevatá (p.153).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

They had gone with the banker to hear the Buddha preach and became converts. But when the Buddha left Sávatthi and went to Rájagaha they reverted to their old faiths, coming back to the Buddha when he returned to Sávatthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the past is of two merchants who travel with caravans across a desert. One, beguiled by goblins, throws away his drinking water and is devoured with all his people and cattle. The other completes his journey safely, not putting faith in the goblins. The moral is that the followers of false teachers are led astray. The foolish merchant was Devadatta (J.i.95ff). This Játaka will be among the last to be forgotten when the Dhamma disappears from the world at the end of the Káliyuga. AA.i.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the king died they found themselves unable to get back, and begged his minister to allow them to start settlements in Jambudípa itself. He agreed, and the settlement of those who had come from Aparagoyána was for that reason called Aparanta (DA.ii.482; MA.i.184) (Aparantaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day a girl came to the hermitage, fleeing from brigands, and corrupted the virtue of the youth. But when she tried to induce him to go away with her, he wished to consult his father.

He came to the Buddha in the Párileyyaka Mango Grove in Nálandá and asked him various questions, recorded in the Samyutta Nikáya (iv.312ff). One of these related to the custom among the Pacchábhumaka (Westlander) brahmins (where, perhaps, he himself belonged) of lifting a man up when dead and carrying him out, calling him by name to speed him heavenward. Surely the Buddha who is an arahant, etc., could make the whole world go to heaven thus if he chose. To this the Buddha answers no, and explains, by various similes, that only a man's kamma can determine where he will be reborn. On another occasion, the Buddha tells him, in answer to a question, that the Buddha teaches the Dhamma in full only to certain disciples and not to others; just as a farmer sowing seed selects, first the best field, then the moderate, and lastly, the field with the worst soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asibandhakaputta tells the Buddha that, according to Nigantha Nátaputta (he is described as a Nigantha-Sávaka, S.iv.317), as a man habitually lives so goes he forth to his destiny. The Buddha points out the absurdity of this view and tells him that all Tathágatas lay down definite rules for the guidance of their followers, so that they may attain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is recorded (S.iv.322ff) that once, when Nálandá was stricken with famine, Asibandhaka visited Nigantha Nátaputta, who asks him to go and defeat the Buddha in debate. Asibandhaka is at first reluctant, but his teacher propounds to him a dilemma to put to the Buddha, and he agrees to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it true that the Buddha extols compassion to clansmen? Why, then, does the Buddha ask for alms in a place stricken with famine? The Buddha's answer is that there are eight ways of injuring clansmen, and that begging for alms is not one of them. And </data>
<data>Asibandhakaputta, pleased with the answer, declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asibandhakaputta's conversation with the Buddha, in which the Buddha tells him that only a man's kamma can determine the state of his rebirth, is quoted in the Nettippaka-rana (pp.45-47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

These beings are unconscious and experience nothing (A.iv.401). As soon as an idea occurs to them they fall from their state (D.i.28). Brahmin ascetics, having practised continual meditation and attained to the fourth jhána, seeing the disadvantages attached to thinking, try to do away with it altogether. Dying in this condition, they are reborn among the Asaññasattá, having form only, but neither sensations, ideas, predispositions nor consciousness. They last only as long as their power of jhána; then an idea occurs to them and they die straightaway (DA.i.118).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Andhakas held that these devas were really only sometimes conscious, which belief the Theravádins rejected as being absurd (Kvu.262).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elder Sobhita was once born among the Asaññasattá and could remember that existence. These devas are long-lived. ThagA.i.291.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Anguttara Nikáya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth division of the Sutta Pitaka, consisting of eleven nipátas (sections) and 9,557 suttas (A.v.361; DA.i.23; Gv.56). The suttas are arranged in numbered lists, probably as aids to memory. Thus we find set out in order first the units, then the pairs, the trios etc., up to groups of eleven. This method of arrangement has evidently influenced the subject matter as well, for we seldom see any reasoned arguments. The lists are often curtly given and curtly explained (See also Hardy's remarks, A.v. introd. p.vii).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the first Council Anuruddha was asked to be the custodian of this Nikáya of 120 bhánaváras and to read it to his pupils (DA.i.15; Mbv.94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha's religion fades away, the first portion of the Sutta Pitaka to disappear will be the Anguttara Nikáya from the eleventh section to the first, and in that order (MA.881).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also sometimes called &lt;b&gt;Ekuttara&lt;/b&gt;. Mil. 392. It is worthy of note that the Ekottarágama Sutra of the Chinese is unlike the Anguttara Nikaya (A.i. introd. ix., n.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikaya quotes the Paráyana, which is evidence of its late compilation.

Two visits of the Buddha to this city are recorded in the Canon; on one occasion he preached the Phena Sutta (S.iii.140ff ) and on the other the Dárukkhandha Sutta (S.iv.179f). In both these references the city is said to be on the Ganges; the town usually called Ayojjhá (Ayodhya) is certainly not on this river. The records, therefore, go back either to a confused or an unintelligent tradition (see Thomas: op. cit., 15; cf. Sáketa), or may possibly refer to another settlement made by colonists from the original Ayojjhá. It is worthy of note that in the Dárukkhandha Sutta some of the MSS. read Kosambí for Ayojjhá. But even Kosambí (q.v.) was on the Jumná and not on the Ganges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Buddhist period, Ayojjhá on the Sarayú was the capital of Dakkhina Kosala, the janapada roughly corresponding to modern Oudh. This, the Ayodhyá of the Ramayana, is about a mile from the modern Fyzabad. In the Játaka Commentary (J.iv.82) there is a mention of Ayojjhá, which here evidently refers to the city of the Sanskrit epics. It is called the capital of King Kálasena. It was besieged by the Andhavenhuputtá, who breached the wall and took the king prisoner. Having thus subjugated the city, they went to Dváravatí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dípavamsa (iii.15) mentions Ayujjhanagara as the capital of King Arindama and of fifty-five of his descendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (SA.ii.233-4), the people of Ayujjhanagara built for the Buddha a vihára in a spot surrounded by forest near a curve of the river. Once a warrior named Jagatipála, of the race of Ráma, came to Ceylon from Ayojjhá, and having slain Vikkampandu, the heir-apparent to the throne, ruled in Rohana for five years. Cv.lvi.13ff.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ayojjhá.-Capital of Siam. From there Vijayarájasíha, King of Ceylon, obtained monks for his own country (Cv.xcviii.91f). A few years later his successor, Kittisirirájasíha, sent an embassy there for the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The King of Siam showed the embassy every mark of favour and granted them the monks. The monks, who came from Ayojjhá to Ceylon, re-established the ordination of monks in the Island. Cv.xcviii.60-139; see also J.R.A.S.

This was in the fifth week after the Enlightenment. With Mára's approval, they came to the Buddha in various forms and in various guises, as he sat at the foot of the Ajapala banyan tree, and danced and sang before him. In the end the Buddha told them that he was beyond temptation by the pleasures of the senses and they went back to their father (S.i.124-7; J.i.78-80, 469; DhA.i.201f., iii.196,199; SN.v.835).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta account, they are said to have asked the Buddha questions regarding himself and his teachings.

It was preached at Jetavana and contains a statement and an exposition of the middle path of peace between the two extremes of pleasures of sense - low, ignoble and unprofitable - and self-mortification, also painful and unprofitable. The path is the Noble Eightfold Path: in preaching the doctrine the preacher should neither appreciate nor depreciate it, he should teach the truth in abstract terms of general principle. He should not be a tale-teller nor confront anyone with improper remarks; he should speak slowly and not hurriedly; he should neither affect provincialisms in speech nor depart from recognised parlance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the discourse a young man, Subhúti, is praised because he walked where calm dwelt (M.iii.230-7; MA.ii.977-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It is identified with modern Ritigala, and is near the modern Habarane in the North-Central Province (Mhv.trans.72, n.3). Pandukábhaya lived there for seven years, awaiting an opportunity to make war on his uncles, and it was near there that he ultimately defeated them (Mhv.x.63-72). At the foot of the mountain, Súratissa built the Makulaka Vihára (Mhv.xxi.6). Lañjatissa built a vihára on the mountain and called it Arittha Vihára (Mhv.xxxiii.27).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jetthatissa occupied the mountain before his fight with Aggabodhi III., and it was there that he organised his forces (Cv.xliv.86).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sena I. built a monastery on the mountain for the use of the Pamsukulikas and endowed it with large revenues (Cv.l.63).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the present day the place is extremely rich in ruins.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Arimaddana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given in the Páli chronicles to the city of Pagan in Burma (Rámañña) (Bode: op. cit., 14). During the time of Parakkamabáhu I. of Ceylon, the King of Arimaddana quarrelled with him, ill-treated his envoys, and seized by force a princess sent from Ceylon to Kamboja. Parakkama sent a punitive expedition under the Damiládhikári Ádicca, who reduced the country to subjection (Cv.lxxvi.10-75).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later Vijayabáhu II. of Ceylon entered into friendly negotiations with the ruler of Arimaddana, and wrote him a letter in the Mágadha language composed by himself. As a result, a friendly treaty was made between them which also resulted in closer contact between the monks of the two countries (Cv.lxxx.6-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to some authorities, quoted by Minayeff (Recherches sur Bouddhisme, p.70), the city was full of learned women. The Gandhavamsa (p.67) mentions a list of twenty-three teachers who wrote their works in Arimaddana. From this context it appears that Arimaddana was known also as Pukkáma (Pukkámasankháte Arimaddananagare). This is supported by evidence from elsewhere (Forchhammer: Jardine Prize Essay, pp.29, 32. Ind. Ant.1893, p.17). It was a minister in Arimaddana who wrote the Nyásappadípatíká (Svd.v.1240). Arimaddana was also the city of birth of the Thera Chapata (Svd.v.1247).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The Buddha tells him that such a view is a perverted one and that its result is rebirth either in purgatory or as an animal.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Aññáta-Kondañña (Aññá-Kondañña) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of a very wealthy brahmin family of Donavatthu near Kapilavatthu and was born before the Buddha. He came to be called by his family name Kondañña. He was learned in the three Vedas, excelling in the science of physiognomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha was born he was among the eight brahmins (the others being Ráma, Dhaja, Lakkhana, Mantí, Bhoja, Suyáma and Sudatta. In the Milinda (236), where the eight names are given, Kondañña appears as Yañña) sent for to prognosticate, and though he was yet quite a novice he declared definitely that the babe would be a Buddha. Thereafter he lived awaiting the Bodhisatta's renunciation. After this happened he left the world with four others, and the five later became known as the Pañcavaggiyá (J.i.65f.; AA.i.78-84; ThagA.ii.1ff). When, after the Enlightenment, the Buddha visited them at Isipatana and preached the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, Kondañña and eighteen crores of brahmas won the Fruit of the First Path. As he was the first among humans to realise the Dhamma the Buddha praised him saying &quot;aññási vata bho Kondañño&quot; twice; hence he came to be known as Aññata Kondañña. (Vin.i.12; UdA.324, 371; Mtu.iii.333). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that in the Burmese MSS. the name appears as Aññási-Kondañña. The Cy. explains Aññáta-Kondañña by &quot;pativedha Kondañña.&quot; In the ThagA. he is called Añña-Kondañña. Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests that Aññá was his personal name (Gotama the Man, p.102).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five days later when the Anattalakhana Sutta was preached he became arahant (Vin.i.13-14). He was the first to be ordained with the formula &quot;ehi, bhikkhu&quot; and the first to receive higher ordination. Later, at Jetavana, amidst a large concourse of monks, the Buddha </data>
<data>declared him to be the best of those who first comprehended the Dhamma (AA.i.84). He was also declared to be pre-eminent among disciples of long-standing (rattaññúnam) (A.i.23). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the assembly of monks he sat behind the two chief disciples. Finding that his presence near the Buddha was becoming inconvenient to himself and others (For his reasons see AA.i.84; SA.i.216), he obtained the Buddha's permission to go and live on the banks of the Mandákini in the Chaddanta-vana, where he stayed for twelve years, only returning at the end of that period to obtain the Buddha's leave for his parinibbána. The elephants in the forest took it in turns to bring him his food and to look after him. Having bidden farewell to the Buddha, he returned to Chaddanta-vana, where he passed away (SA.i.218; AA.i.84). We are told (SA.i.219) that all Himavá wept at his death. The obsequies were elaborately performed by eight thousand elephants with the deva Nágadatta at their head. All the devas from the lowest to the highest brahma world took part in the ceremony, each deva contributing a piece of sandalwood. Five hundred monks, led by Anuruddha, were present. The relics were taken to Veluvana and handed over to the Buddha, who with his own hand deposited them in a silver cetiya which appeared from the earth. Buddhaghosa states that the cetiya existed even in his time (SA.i.219).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several verses attributed to Kondañña are given in the Theragáthá, admonishing fellow celibates to lead the higher life, because everything is impermanent, bound to ill and void of soul (Thag.674-88).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one occasion he preached to Sakka at the latter's own request; Sakka expressed himself as greatly pleased because the sermon was worthy even of the Buddha.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vangisa once extolled his virtues in the presence of the Buddha (Thag.v.673; ThagA.ii.3).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;In Padumuttara's time Kondañña had been a rich householder, and, seeing one of the monks given preference in seniority, he wished for a similar rank for himself in the future. Towards this end he did many acts of piety, one of them being to build a golden chamber over the Buddha's relics. In Vipassí's time was a householder, Mahákála, and gave to the Buddha the first-fruits of his field in nine stages of their produce (ThagA.ii.1; DhA.i.80).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Apadána (i.48f.; The Divy 430 mentions another previous birth of Kondañña), he offered the first meal to Padumuttara after his Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punna Mantáníputta was his nephew and was ordained by him. ThagA.i.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mantání was Aññáta-Kondañña's sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On informing the Buddha that they had no favorite teacher in whom they had confidence, they were told that they should embrace and fulfill the Sound Doctrine (apannaka-dhamma), and the Buddha proceeded to explain it. In the course of this elucidation reference is made to the teachings of several other schools of thought, particularly those of the Jainas and the Ájívakas, including the six Environments of life (abhijáti). For a discussion of some of these see Further Dial. i.293, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta concludes with the arahant-ideal as the height to be attained by the being who tortures neither himself nor others, and who is given to torturing neither himself nor others, but lives here and now beyond all appetites, blissful and perfected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.i.400-13. For a derivation of the name see Weber: Ind. Str. iii.150, and Kuhn: Beitr., where the word is derived from a-prasna-ka. Buddhaghosa defines it as aviruddha advejjhagámi ekasangáhiko (MA.ii.630).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

He is mentioned as staying with the well-known paribbájakas, Varadhara and Sakuludáyi. The Buddha visits them and talks about the four factors of Dhamma (dhammapadáni) which are held in esteem by everyone: not-coveting, not-malice, right-mindfulness, right-concentration (A.ii.29-31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion they discuss the &quot;brahmin truth.&quot; The Buddha visits them and tells them what he considers to be the brahmin truths (bráhmanasaccáni): that no creatures are to be harmed; all sense-delights are impermanent, painful and changing; all becomings are impermanent, etc.; a brahmin is one who has no part in or attachment to anything any more (A.ii.176-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

E.g., A.i.213; iv.252, 256, 260. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The countries mentioned are Anga, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaasi')"&gt;Kásí&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii')"&gt;Vajji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallaa')"&gt;Mallá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cetiya')"&gt;Cetí&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vamsaa')"&gt;Vamsá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuru')"&gt;Kuru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancala')"&gt;Pañcála&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/macchaa')"&gt;Macchá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/surasena')"&gt;Súrasena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="assaka')"&gt;Assaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="avanti')"&gt;Avantí&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhaara')"&gt;Gandhára&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kamboja')"&gt;Kamboja&lt;/a&gt;. Other similar lists occur elsewhere, e.g. D.ii.200 (where ten countries are mentioned); see also Mtu.i.34 and i.198; and Lal.24(22). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was to the east of Magadha, from which it was separated by the River &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaa')"&gt;Campá&lt;/a&gt;, and had as its capital city Campá, near the modern Bhagalpur (Cunningham, pp. 546-7). Other cities mentioned are &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya')"&gt;Bhaddiya&lt;/a&gt; (DA.i.279; DhA.i.384) and &lt;a href="assapura')"&gt;Assapura&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.271).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is generally referred to by the name of its people, the Angá, though occasionally (E.g., DhA.i.384) the name Angarattha is used. In the Buddha's time it was subject to Magadha, (ThagA.i.548) whose king Bimbisára was, we are told, held in esteem also by the </data>
<data>people of Anga (MA.i.394), and the people of the two countries evidently used to pay frequent visits to each other (J.ii.211). We never hear of its having regained its former independence, and traditions of war between the two countries are mentioned (E.g., J.iv.454; J.v.316; J.vi.271).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Buddha's time the Angarájá was just a wealthy nobleman, and he is mentioned merely as having granted a pension to a Brahmin (M.ii.163). The people of Anga and Magadha are generally mentioned together, so we may gather that by the Buddha's time they had become one people. They provide &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa')"&gt;Uruvela-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; with offerings for his great sacrifice (Vin.i.27). It was their custom to offer an annual sacrifice to Mahá-Brahmá in the hope of gaining reward a hundred thousand fold. On one occasion Sakka appears in person and goes with them to the Buddha so that they may not waste their energies in futile sacrifices (SA.i.269-70).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several discourses were preached in the Anga country, among them being the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sonadanda_sutta')"&gt;Sonadanda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and the two Assapura Suttas (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_assapura_s')"&gt;Mahá&lt;/a&gt;- and Cúla-). The&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahagovinda_s')"&gt;Mahágovinda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; seems to indicate that once, in the past, Dhatarattha was king of Anga. But this, perhaps, refers to another country (Dial.ii.270 n.; see also The Rámáyana i.8, 9, 17, 25). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sona')"&gt;Sona Kolivisa&lt;/a&gt;, before he entered the Order, was a squire (paddhagu) of Anga. Thag.v.632.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Anga.&lt;/b&gt; King.-Chief lay supporter of Sumana Buddha (BuA.130); the Buddhavamsa mentions Varuna and Sarana as Sumana's aggupattháká and Udena as upattháka. Bu.v.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Anga.&lt;/b&gt;-A king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; on whose feet </data>
<data>hair grew. He inquired of the brahmins the way to heaven, and was told to retire to the forest and tend the sacred fire. He went to Himavá with many cows and women and did as he was counselled. The milk and ghee left over from his sacrifices were thrown away, and from them arose many minor rivers, the Ganges itself, and even the sea. Later he became Indra's companion. J.vi.203&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Anga.&lt;/b&gt;-King of the Anga country, between whom and King Magadha there was constant war, with varying fortunes. In the end, Magadha, with the help of the Nága king Campeyya, seized Anga and slew him. J.iv.453.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Anga.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the Pacceka Buddhas mentioned in the list in the Apadana Commentary. ApA.i.107.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt; &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Angá&lt;/b&gt;.-Chieftains of Anga, so called,   according to the Digha Nikáya Commentary (i.279), because of the beauty of   their limbs. Their name was customarily (rúlhi-vasena) used to denote their   country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was told in reference to the Great Renunciation to show that in former lives also the Bodhisatta had renounced a royal state (J.ii.86-92). The latter part of the story is given in the Mahávastu and is called the Saraksepana Játaka (Mtu.ii.82-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is figured in the Bharhut Stupa (Cunningham, p.70, and Plate xxvii.13) and in the Sanchi Tope (Fergusson, Tree and Serpent Worship, p.181, Plate xxxvi). King Kittisiri of Ceylon wrote a beautiful poem in Sinhalese based on this Játaka. Cv. Supplement 101, vs.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Avíci&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the eight great purgatories (mahániraya) (J.v.266). It is ten thousand leagues in extent and forms part of a cakkavála (SnA.ii.443).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milindapañha (p.5), however, places it outside the sphere of the earth. Spence Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, p.26) mentions a tradition which says that Avíci is seven hundred miles directly under the Bodhi Tree at Gaya. In later books, e.g. the Dhammapada Commentary, it is represented as being under the earth, for we are told that the earth opened wide to allow the flames of Avíci to escape and to drag down sinners into its bowels (E.g., DhA.i.127, 147; iii.181). It seems to have been specially designed for those who had committed very grievous crimes, among whom are &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Devadatta; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cunda, the pork butcher; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ananda, who raped his cousin the Therí   Uppalavanná; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the ascetic Jambuka, who in a previous   birth had insulted an arahant; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the murderer of the Pacceka Buddha   Sunetta; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sívalí, who in a former birth had   blockaded a city for seven years; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Suppabuddha, who insulted the Buddha;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mallikká, because of her misbehaviour   with a dog (she was only there seven days); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ciñcá-Mánaviká, because she falsely   accused the Buddha; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;and Kapila, brother of Sodhana, for   reviling pious monks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For details and references see under these names; see also Mil.357.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa, Avíci is often </data>
<data>called Mahá Niraya (AA.i.376). Descriptions of it are to be found in several places in the four Nikáyas (E.g., M.iii.183; A.i.141-2). It is a quadrangular space, one hundred leagues each way, four-doored, walled all round and above with steel and with floor of incandescent molten steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapadatthakathá gives a description of the tortures that await the entrant to Avíci. When, for instance, Devadatta entered there, his body became one hundred leagues in height, his head, as far as the outer ear, entered into an iron skull; his feet sank up to the ankles in iron, an iron stake as thick as the trunk of a palmyra tree came from the west wall, pierced the small of his back and, penetrating his breast, entered the east wall. Other similar stakes came from the south and from the north and transfixed him (DhA.i.148).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire of Avíci is so powerful that it destroys the eyes of anyone looking at it from a distance of one hundred leagues (A.i.142). It would destroy in a moment a rock as large as a gabled house, yet beings born there remain undestroyed, as though reposing in their mother's womb (DhA.i.127; Mil.67).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beings born in Avíci suffer for periods of varying lengths; thus, Malliká, Pasenadi's queen, remained only for seven days (DhA.iii.121), while Devadatta is destined to pass there 100,000 kappas (DhA.i.148). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta Nipata (p.126) gives the names of various specified periods of suffering, which, according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.i.476), are to be spent in Avíci; they are Abbuda, Nirabbuda, Ababa, Ahaha, Atata, Kumuda, Sogandhika, Uppalaka, Pundaríka, and Paduma, taken in a geometrical progression of twenty (i.e. twenty Abbudas=one Nirabbuda, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mode of suffering in Avíci is </data>
<data>described as Sarájita (SA.iii.100).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that the word Avíci occurs only once in the four Nikáyas - namely, in a passage in the Cakkavatti-Síhánáda Sutta of the Digha Nikáya (D.iii.75; repeated in A.i.159) - but in this context there is no indication that the name refers to a purgatory. The word is not found in a list of purgatories given in the Sutta Nipáta (pp.126-31) and in the Samyutta (i.152). It is, however, found in a poem in the Itivuttaka (No. 89) which recurs both in the Vinaya (ii.203) and in the Dhammasangani (Section 1280), and there it is specifically called a niraya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Digha passage mentioned above, the reference to Avíci is in connection with a tremendous growth of population which will occur in Jambudípa in a future age. Houses will be so close that a cock could fly from any one to the next, and one would think it Avíci (avíci maññe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.iii.73, n.1) that the word (which he translates as Waveless Deep) might have been originally used to denote density of population. Buddhaghosa (DA.iii.855) explains it as &quot;nirantara-púrita&quot; perhaps in the sense that it is filled with fire. In the Visuddhi Magga (ii.449) the word appears to be a synonym for jars (disintegration) and is used in connection with the disintegration of earth, water, mountains, sun, moon, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avíci is often referred to as the lowest point of the universe (Thus, e.g.,Vsm.ii.390, 486; Mbv.57). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief suffering endured there is that of heat (MNidA., p.8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was there that the king's brother Tissa was ordained. When the monks had refused for seven years to hold the uposatha ceremony, Asoka sent his minister to summon them to the Asokáráma. There the misguided minister beheaded several theras who refused to obey his orders. It was there that Moggaliputta Tissa held the Third Council and made a compilation of the Dhamma (Mhv.v.80, 163, 174, 236, 276).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asoka used to feed 60,000 monks daily at the Asokáráma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the foundation of the Mahá Thúpa in Anurádhapura, sixty thousand monks under Mittinna came from Asokáráma (Mhv.xxix.36). There, too, lived Dhammarakkhita, the teacher of Nágasena (Mil.16-18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indagutta Thera was appointed by the king to superintend the building of the vihára (Sp.i.48-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was from Asokáráma that Mahinda set out on his mission to Ceylon (Sp.i.69). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Anupiya (Anupiyá)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A township in the Malla country to the east of Kapilavatthu. In the mango grove there (the Anupiya-ambavana) the Buddha, having arrived from Anomá and having ordained himself, spent the first week after his renunciation, before going to Rájagaha, thirty leagues away (J.i.65-6). He went there again after his return from Kapilavatthu, whither he had gone to see his relations, and large numbers of Sákiyan princes joined the Order, including Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta and their barber, Upáli (Vin.ii.180f.; AA.i.108; DhA.i.133; iv.127).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was during this stay that the Buddha preached the Sukhavihári Játaka (J.i.140). From Anupiya the Buddha went to Kosambi (Vin.ii.184). Near Anupiya was the pleasaunce where the paribbájaka of the Bhaggavagotta lived. The Buddha visited him once while staying at Anupiya and it was then that he preached the Pátika Sutta (D.iii.1ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anupiya was the birthplace of Dabba Mallaputta. ThagA.i.41; the Ap., however, says Kusinárá (ii.473).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Sona Potiriyaputta was meditating the Buddha sent forth a ray of glory from the mango grove to encourage him (ThagA.i.316).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mango grove belonged to the Malla-rájás; they built a vihára therein for the Buddha's residence (UdA.161; DA.iii.816).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name is sometimes spelt Anopiya and Anúpiya (J.i.140). See also Anomá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Asita Devala&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Asita Devala.&lt;/b&gt;-A sage (isi). His story is given in the &lt;a href="assalaayana')"&gt;Assaláyana Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.154ff). Once there were seven brahmin sages living in thatched cabins in the wilds. They conceived the view that the brahmins are the highest class of men and that they alone are the legitimate sons of Brahma. Hearing of this, Asita Devala appeared before their hermitage in orange attire, with stout sandals and staff, and shouted for them. The brahmins cursed him with the intention of shrivelling him into a cinder, but the more they cursed the more comely and handsome grew Asita. Feeling that their austerities were evidently fruitless, they questioned Asita who urged them to discard their delusion. Having learnt his identity, they saluted him and wished to be instructed; Asita examined and cross-questioned them about their pretensions regarding their lineage and they could find no answer. They thereupon followed his advice and renounced their claims to superiority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says that Asita Devala was the Bodhisatta. MA.ii.785.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Asita Devala.&lt;/b&gt;-More commonly called Kála Devala, probably identical with (1) above, and mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/indriya_jat_423')"&gt;Indriya Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.463ff). He was one of the seven chief disciples of the Bodhisatta&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhanga')"&gt;Sarabhanga&lt;/a&gt; and lived with many thousand sages in &lt;a href="avanti')"&gt;Avanti&lt;/a&gt; Dakkhinápatha. He had a younger brother Nárada, also an ascetic, who lived in Arañjara. When Nárada became enamoured of a courtesan on the river-bank near Arañjara, Kála Devala flew to him, and in due course brought Sálissara, Mendissara and Pabbatissara to </data>
<data>admonish him. When they, too, failed in their efforts to convert Nárada, Kála Devala brought the master of all sages, Sarabhanga, who with their help persuaded Nárada to give up his love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this present age Kála Devala became Mahá Kaccana (J.iii.469).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Assaji-Punabbasuká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The followers of Assaji and Punabbasu. They lived in Kítágiri, between Sávatthi and Álavi, and were guilty of various evil practices. They used to grow flowers, make wreaths and garlands, and send them to girls and women of respectable families and also to slave girls, to lie with such women, and disregard the precepts regarding the eating of food at the wrong time, using perfumes, visiting shows, singing and playing games of various sorts (they violated eighteen precepts, Sp.iii.625). Their abandoned ways of life won popularity for them, and virtuous monks, who did not belong to their group, were not welcomed by the people of the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha heard of their nefarious doings from a monk who had been sojourning in the district, and having convened a meeting of the Sangha, sent Sáriputta and Moggallána, together with a number of other monks, (for the recalcitrant were passionate and violent), to carry out the Pabbájaniyakamma (Act of Banishment) against them. The deputation of the Sangha went to Kítágiri and made an order that the Assaji-Punabbasuká should no longer dwell there, but the latter, instead of obeying the injunction, abused the monks, accusing them of partiality, and not only departed from Kítágiri, but also left the Order. When the matter was reported to the Buddha he had the Pabbájaniyakamma revoked (&quot;because it had served no purpose&quot;) (Vin.ii.9-13, 14, 15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Dhammapada Commentary (ii.109) we are told that Assaji and Punabbasu had originally been disciples of Sáriputta and Moggallána, and that when the two Aggasávakas admonished them and their followers on the wickedness of their conduct, some of them reformed themselves and a few retired to the householder's life.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Assaji-Punabbasukas seem to have had a special dislike for Sáriputta and Moggallána. Once the Buddha, on his way somewhere from Sávatthi, accompanied by Sáriputta, Moggallána and five hundred others, sent word to the Assaji-Punabbasukas to prepare sleeping places for them. They sent answer that the Buddha was very welcome, but not Sáriputta and Moggallána, because &quot;they were men of sinful desires and influenced by such desires.&quot; (Vin.ii.171)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But elsewhere (Kítágiri Sutta, M.i.473ff) even the Buddha is represented as having been lightly regarded by them. When it was reported to them that the Buddha lived on only one meal a day and found that it made him well and healthy, their reply was that they themselves ate in the evening and the early morning and at noon and outside prescribed hours, and that they found this quite agreeable and saw no reason for changing their mode of life. It is true, however, that even on this occasion when the Buddha sent for them, they came dutifully and listened patiently to his admonition on the necessity of implicit obedience to a teacher in whom they had faith, and we are told that they were &quot;even gladdened in their hearts&quot; after hearing the Buddha. There is, however, no evidence that they reformed after hearing him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.525) the Assaji-Punabbasuká are mentioned as an example of those who paid no heed to precepts great or small, which they had undertaken to observe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samantapásádiká (iii.614) mentions that Kítágiri was chosen by them as residence because it was watered by both monsoons, produced three crops, and had suitable sites for buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were five hundred in number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Anulá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Anulá.&lt;/b&gt;-Daughter of Mutasiva, King of Ceylon, and wife of Mahánága, who was brother and sub-king to Devánampiya-Tissa. With five hundred other women she heard Mahinda preach the Petavatthu, the Vimánavatthu and the Sacca Samyutta, and together with the others became a Stream-enterer (Mhv.xiv.56-7; Dpv.xi.8; xii.82). Later, hearing the sermon preached by Mahinda in the Mahámeghavana, she, with others, became a Sakadágámí, and expressed to the king their wish to receive ordination. It was to enable these to be ordained that Sanghamittá was sent for (Mhv.xv.18-19; Sp.i.90ff.; Dpv.xv.73ff). Until the arrival of Sanghamittá, Anulá and her companions observed the ten precepts and lived in the Upásiká Vihára. Mhv.xviii.9-12. The Tiká (p.388) says they took on the ekásanikanga vow as well; see also Mbv. pp.121, 144, 167.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her ordination Anulá became an arahant (Mhv.xix.65; xvi.41) and was the first woman arahant in Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Anulá.&lt;/b&gt;-Widow of Khallátanága, King of Ceylon, and later wife of Vattagámani (Mhv.xxxiii.35, 36). When Vattagámani had to flee from his enemies, she was the only one of his wives whom he took with him, because she was with child (Mhv.xxxiii.45). Later, when they were hiding in Malaya, under the protection of Tanasiva, Anulá quarrelled with the wife of Tanasiva and, as a result, Vattagámani killed him. (Mhv.xxxiii.62ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Anulá.&lt;/b&gt;-Wife of Coranága and Queen of Ceylon for four months (in A.D. 12-16). She was a lewd woman and killed her husband that she might marry Mahácúla's son, Tissa. She soon got tired of him and poisoned him. Then, in succession, she had as husbands Siva, a palace guard; Vatuka, a Tamil carpenter; Tissa, a woodcarrier; the Damila Niliya, a palace </data>
<data>priest - all of whom she removed by poisoning. The last one she killed because she wished to live indiscriminately with thirty-two palace guards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end she was killed by Kutakannatissa (Mhv.xxxiv.16-34; Dpv.xix.50ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Anulá.&lt;/b&gt;-The chief woman-disciple of Kassapa Buddha. Bu.xxv.40; J.i.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Anulá.&lt;/b&gt;-Daughter of Cúlasetthi of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. She lived with her husband in Andhakavinda, and after her father's death she fed brahmins in his name, but this pious act was of no benefit to him (PvA.105ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Anulá.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the chief women-supporters of Mangala Buddha (Bu.iv.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In it was a Deer-park where the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; used to stay. On one such occasion&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kakudha')"&gt;Kakudha&lt;/a&gt; came to see him (S.i.54), and also the Paribbájaka &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kundaliya')"&gt;Kuñdaliya&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.73) who lived near by. Here were preached the Sáketa Sutta, (S.v.219) the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saketa_jat_068_237')"&gt;Sáketa Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.308; DhA.iii.317ff.; SnA.531) and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaraa_v_s')"&gt;Jará Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; was staying there a nun of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jatila')"&gt;Jatila&lt;/a&gt; persuasion visited him and questioned him on the use of samadhi (A.iv.427-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thera &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambugaamika')"&gt;Jambugámiyaputta&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.86; SnA.531) dwelt there while yet a novice. Once the Buddha was staying at Añjanavana with a large company of monks and some of the monks slept on the sandbanks of the river Sarabhú near by. During the night floods rose and the Thera &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gavampati')"&gt;Gavampati&lt;/a&gt; controlled the water by his mystic powers (Ibid., i.104; Thag.v.38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhuuta')"&gt;Bhúta&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.494) stayed in Añjana-vana while visiting his relatives in Sáketa, and the Thera &lt;a href="anjanavaniya_th')"&gt;Añjanavaniya&lt;/a&gt; spent the rainy season there on a couch (ThagA.i.127). There &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaataa')"&gt;Sujátá&lt;/a&gt; met the Buddha, and having listened to his discourse became an arahant (Thig.vv.145-50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ancient times the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt; used </data>
<data>to hunt in this garden, thus it was that the deer &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandiya')"&gt;Nandiya&lt;/a&gt; met him (J.iii.270f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The garden was so-called because it was thickly covered with añjanna-creepers that bore collyrium-coloured flowers. Others say that añjana is the name of a spreading tree (ThagA.i.128; SA.iii.195).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The well-taught Ariyan disciple does not wonder as to the cause and effect of things, he knows that it really is the arising and the passing away of the world. His is the knowledge of the trained man; he is possessed of the insight of revulsion, he stands knocking at the door of the deathless. S.ii.77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

He was the chief student of the Bodhisatta Sarabhanga, who lived with him. He is identified with Ananda. J.iii.463, 469.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Anusissa.-Probably the same as Anusissa (1). An ascetic and student of the Bodhisatta Jotipála, who, in the latter part of the story, is identified with Sarabhanga, without any explanation being given. When various kings, together with Sakka, visited Sarabhanga to consult him on their doubts, it was Anusissa who, at the request of his brotherascetics, introduced them to the Bodhisatta. Here, too, he is identified with Ananda. J.v.133-40; 151.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He had been in the habit of destroying the crops of the people by causing hail-storms. When Majjhantika Thera was sent by Moggaliputtatissa's Council to convert Kasmíra-Gandhára, the thera went to Araváladaha and standing in the air above it showed himself to the Nágas. Hearing of this the nága king came out and tried to frighten the Elder with various terrors. When all his attempts had failed he acknowledged defeat and the thera preached to him. He and his 84,000 followers were established in the Refuge and the Five Precepts (v.l. Áravála). Sp.i.65; Mhv.xii.9-20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Once when he was staying in a forest hut in the Mahávana in Vesáli, near to where the Buddha was, certain wandering ascetics came to him and asked him whether or not a Tathágata exists after death; dissatisfied with his answer they called him &quot;fool&quot; and went away. Thereupon Anurádha sought advice from the Buddha, who asked him &quot;How, inasmuch as it cannot be said of a Tathágata even in this very life that he really exists, can anything be said regarding him after death?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S.iii.116-19; the same story is repeated, with slight expansions, in S.iv.380-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

Anurádha.-A Sákiya prince, brother of Bhaddakaccána; a great uncle of Pandukabhaya.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ayoghara&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as the son of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. Both the earlier children of the Queen Consort had been eaten up by a she-goblin. For the third child, therefore, an iron house (Ayoghara) was built, and in this the Bodhisatta was born, hence his name, Ayoghara.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the she-goblin had died, but yet the Bodhisatta grew up in the iron house. When he was sixteen his father, wishing to give him the kingdom, had him taken in ceremonial procession round the city. Wondering at all that he saw, he asked why he had been denied the sight of all these things before. When told the reason, he reflected that all life was a prison, that though he had escaped the goblin, there still remained old age and death. Accordingly, at the end of the procession, he announced his intention of renouncing the world. His parents and many others being converted to his views, they followed him into the forest, where a special hermitage was built for them by Vissakamma under Sakka's orders.

But according to another account (D.ii.235), Máhissati is mentioned as having been, at least for some time, the capital of Avanti. It is quite likely that ancient Avanti was divided into two parts, the northern part having its capital at Ujjení and the southern part (also called &lt;b&gt;Avanti Dakkhinápatha&lt;/b&gt;) at Máhissati (Máhismatí) (Bhandarkar: Carmichael Lectures (1918), p.54). This theory is supported by the fact that in the Mahábhárata (ii.31, 10), Avanti and Máhismatí are referred to as two different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Buddha's time, the King of Avanti was Pajjota, a man of violent temper (Vin.i.277), and therefore known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cannda_ppajjota')"&gt;Canda Pajjota&lt;/a&gt;. He wished to conquer the neighbouring kingdom of Kosambí, of which Udena was king, but his plans did not work out as he had anticipated. Instead, his daughter &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasuladattaa')"&gt;Vásuladattá&lt;/a&gt; became Udena's wife and the two countries continued to be on friendly terms.

For a summary see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasuladattaa')"&gt;Vásuladattá&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of Assaka is invariably mentioned in connection with Avanti.

<data>became a centre of Buddhism. Among eminent monks and nuns who were either born or resided there, are to be found  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana')"&gt;Mahá Kaccána&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda')"&gt;Nanda Kumáraputta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sona')"&gt;Sona Kutikanna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala')"&gt;Dhammapála&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhaya')"&gt;Abhayarájakumára&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isidatta')"&gt;Isidatta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isidaasii_thi')"&gt;Isidásí&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that when Pajjota heard of the Buddha's advent to the world, he sent his chaplain's son, Kaccána, with seven others, to invite him to Avanti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having listened to the Buddha's teaching, the messengers became arahants, and when Kaccána conveyed to the Buddha the king's invitation to Avanti, he was asked by the Buddha to return and represent him. Kaccána returned to Avanti and converted Pajjota to the faith of the Buddha (ThagA.i.485). Henceforward Mahá Kaccána seems to have spent a good deal of his time in Avanti, dwelling in the city of Kuraraghara in the Papáta Pabbata (S.iii.9, 12; iv.115-16; A.v.46; also UdA.307).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The religion thus introduced, however, does not seem to have spread to any extent until much later; for we find Mahá Kaccána experiencing great difficulty in collecting ten monks, in order that Sona Kutikanna might receive the higher Ordination; in fact it was not until three years had elapsed that he succeeded (Vin.i.195). Later, when Sona Kutikanna visited the Buddha at Sávatthi, he conveyed to the Buddha Mahá Kaccána's request that special rules might be laid down for the convenience of the monks of Avanti Dakkhinápatha and of, other border countries (Vin.i.197-8). </data>
<data>The Buddha agreed, and among the rules so laid down were the following:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(1) The higher Ordination could be given with only four monks and a Vinayadhara. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(2) Monks are allowed the use of shoes with thick linings (because in Avanti the soil is black on the surface, rough and trampled by cattle). &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(3) Monks are enjoined to bathe frequently (the men of Avanti attaching great importance to bathing). &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(4) Sheepskins, goatskins, etc., could be used as coverlets. &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;(5) Robes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district, and the ten days' rule with regard to such a gift will not begin until the robes have actually reached the monk's hands (Cp. the first nissaggiya rule, Vin.iii.195-6) (this, evidently, because of difficulty of access).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time of the Vesáli Council, however, Avanti had become one of the important centres of the orthodox school, for we find &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa')"&gt;Yasa Kákandakaputta&lt;/a&gt; sending messengers to Avanti to call representatives to the Council, and we are told that eighty-eight arahants obeyed the summons (Vin.ii.298-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other localities in Avanti (besides those mentioned above) were Ghanaselapabbata, Makkarakata and Velugáma, and, in Jaina works, we find mention also of Sudarsanapura (Law: Ksatriya Tribes, p.148).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the Buddha's day there were rumours of the King of Avanti making preparations to attack Magadha, but we are not told that he ever did so (E.g.,M.iii.7). Subsequently, however, before the time of Candagupta, Avanti became incorporated with Magadha. Before Asoka became King of Magadha he was the Magadha Viceroy of Avanti and ruled in Ujjeni, and it was in Ujjeni that Mahinda and Sanghamittá were born and grew up (Mhv.xiii.8ff). </data>
<data>But the country seems to have retained its name at least as late as the second century A.D., as may be seen from Rudradáman's Inscription at Junagadh (Buddhist India, p.28).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avanti is now identified with the country north of the Vindhaya Mountains and north-east of Bombay, roughly corresponding to modern Málwa, Nimár and adjoining parts of the Central Provinces (Law: Geography of Early Buddhism, p.22).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Milindapañha (Trs.ii.250, n.1) Avanti is mentioned as one of the three mandalas or great divisions of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')"&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/a&gt;, the other two being Pácína and Dakkhinápatha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a late tradition recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhavamsa')"&gt;Buddhavamsa&lt;/a&gt; (Bu.xxviii.10), the Buddha's mat (nisídana) and rug were deposited, after his death, in Avanti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has sometimes been suggested that Avanti was the home of modern Páli (E.g.,in Bud. India, pp.153-4). It has further been suggested that the Avanti school of monks - founded by Mahá Kaccána, who was considered the greatest analytical exponent of the Buddha's time - living in comparative isolation (as seen above) on account of difficulty of access (Avanti, however, lay on the road taken by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari')"&gt;Bávari's&lt;/a&gt; ten disciples on their way from Patitthána to Sávatthi), and laying special stress on dhutaváda practices (Vin.ii.299) - developed branches of knowledge dealing mainly with grammar and doctrinal interpretation by ways of exegetical analysis. The Páli grammar ascribed to Kaccáyana and the Netti-ppakarana were both works of this school. For a discussion of this see PLC.181ff &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avanti was one of the parts into which the earth was divided by King Renu, with the help of his Great Steward, Mahá-Govinda. The King of Avanti at the time was Vessabhú and his capital Máhissati. </data>

During his reign the Bodhisatta was born, under the name of Citta, in a Candála village outside Ujjeni. His story is related in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/citta_sambhuuta_jat_498')"&gt;Citta-Sambhúta Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.

He is referred to also in the Dhamnaddhaja Játaka (J.ii.195), where the Bodhisatta relates how, as Araka, he had developed thoughts of loving-kindness and practised the brahmavihárá for seven years and then was born in the Brahma-world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His name appears again in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.iv.136-8) in a list of teachers, and we are told that among Araka's pupils those who followed his teachings were born in the Brahma-world, while the others were born in various purgatories. In the Anguttara context no special mention is made of his having taught the brahma-viháras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was so called because he engaged himself in a series of good works, each being of greater merit than the last, with the object of freeing himself from suffering. In the end he entered the Order, but finding the rules too numerous and irksome, he wished to return to the lay-life. His colleagues took him to the Buddha, who asked him to observe one rule only - guarding his mind; he agreed and became a Stream-enterer. DhA.i.297-300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When Ananda announces her death to the Buddha at Ñátiká in the Giñjakávasatha, and inquires where she had been born, the Buddha says that she had been reborn spontaneously in the Suddhávásá, there to pass away, destined never to return.

It was whilst doing business as a hawker here that the Bodhisatta, born as Seriva, crossed the wishes of another hawker, who in the present age was Devadatta. This was the beginning of Devadatta's enmity towards the Buddha. J.i.111, 113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day on his way to the park he saw a forest fire which made him wish to burn all his defilements. Later, he saw men catching fish; one large fish broke through the net and escaped. Wishing to escape himself, he left the world and later became a Pacceka Buddha (SnA.i.114-15; ApA.i.159-60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stanza attributed to him is included in the Khagga-visána Sutta.

Being pleased with him, the king wished to present him with a village of which the revenue was a thousand, but the ascetic declined the gift. For twelve years the ascetic lived in the park; then, desiring a change, he went away, and in the course of his wanderings, arrived at a ferry on the Ganges, where lived a foolish ferryman named Aváriyapitá. He took the Bodhisatta across, on the latter's promising to tell him how to increase his wealth, his welfare and his virtue. On reaching the other side, the Bodhisatta advised the ferryman on the desirability of getting his fare before crossing if he wished to increase his wealth; he then proceeded to recite to him the stanzas on the virtue of compassion, which, for twelve years, he had daily recited to the king. Incensed at feeling that he had been cheated out of his money, the ferryman started striking the ascetic; his wife, coming along with his food, tried to stop him. Thereupon he struck her, upsetting the food and causing her womb to miscarry. He was brought before the king and punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good advice is wasted on fools, like fine gold on beasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told regarding a foolish ferryman of Aciravatí. When a certain monk came to him one evening to be taken across the river, the ferryman was annoyed and steered so badly that he wet the monk's robes and delayed him. The two ferrymen were the same (J.iii.228-32).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

At that time the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, growing jealous of his son Prince Brahmadatta, banished both him and his wife, Asitábhú. They went to the Himálaya and lived in a hut of leaves. One day the prince, becoming enamoured of a Candakinnarí, followed her, forsaking his wife. (The kinnarí's name was Candá, see Candá 9). Asitábhú went to the Bodhisatta and, having developed various superhuman powers, returned to her hut. Brahmadatta, having failed in his quest, returned to the hut where he found his wife poised in mid-air uttering songs of joy over her newfound freedom. When she left, he lived in solitude till, at his father's death, he succeeded to the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a young girl, the daughter of a servitor of the two chief disciples. She was married, but finding her husband neglectful of her, visited the two Chief Disciples. Under their instruction she attained the First Fruit of the Path and embraced the religious life, ultimately becoming an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was Asitábhú in the previous birth (J.ii.229ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is referred to in the Vibhanga Commentary (p.470f) in connection with a King of Benares who, having gone into the forest with his queen to eat roast flesh, fell in love with a kinnarí and deserted his wife. When he returned to his queen he found her flying through the air away from him, having developed iddhi powers. A tree-sprite then uttered a stanza, citing the example of Asitábhú. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In anger he went to Sáriputta who, on hearing his grievances, discoursed at length on the Abhidhamma. Annoyed thereat he repaired to Ananda, to whom he told the story. Ananda preached them a very short sermon, and the upásakas in despair sought the Buddha. The Buddha pointed out to them that they had been too hasty in their condemnation.

Ariyavamsa.&lt;/b&gt;-A compilation, probably of the life-histories of men eminent in the Buddhist Order, made in Ceylon and read aloud publicly for the edification of the people. The reading of the Ariyavamsa seems once to have been a regular feature of gatherings in the Buddhist viháras on feast days. King Voháraka-T1ssa made endowments for the giving of alms throughout Ceylon on the occasions when the Ariyavamsa was read (Mhv.xxxvi.38; Mhv.trans.258, n.6). A sutta called &lt;b&gt;Ariyavamsa Sutta&lt;/b&gt; is mentioned in the Commentaries (DA.i.50; MA.i.14) as an example of a discourse preached by the Buddha on his own initiative (attajjhásaya). This perhaps refers to the sermon on the four Ariyavamsá in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.ii.27). See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_ariyavamsa_s')"&gt;Mahá-Ariyavamsa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

He was a pupil of the famous Ye-din (&quot;water-carrier&quot;) of Sagaing (for an account of him see Bode, op. cit., 41f), and with great zeal and enthusiasm learnt the Abhidhammattha-vibhávaní from his teacher. Later, Ariyavamsa wrote a commentary on this work and called it the Manisáramañjúsá. A charming anecdote is related of how he read the work to his colleagues and readily accepted their corrections with gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among his other works are the Manidípa, a Tíká on the Atthasáliní, a grammatical treatise, the Gandhábharana, and a study of the Játakas called the Játakavisodhana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ariyavamsa spent only a part of his life at Sagaing and afterwards taught at Ava, where the king was sometimes among his listeners. He was among the first of Burmese litterateurs to write a </data>

He hated the sight of women until he was seduced by a dancing-girl. He was banished from home together with the girl, and they lived in a forest-hut, where the girl tempted an ascetic and robbed him of his mystic power. The Bodhisatta, realising this, gave up the woman, and himself became an ascetic. The story is told in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_palobhana_jat_263')"&gt;Cullapalobhana-Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. J.ii.329-31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Anitthigandhakumára.&lt;/b&gt;-Similar to the above, the story being called the Mahápalobhana-Játaka. J.iv.469-73.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Anitthigandhakumára.&lt;/b&gt;-Another Anitthigandha, of Sávatthi. He refused to marry unless a woman could be found rivalling in beauty an image which he had made. Envoys were sent out and, in Ságala, they discovered a sixteen-year-old girl to answer to the desired qualifications. The marriage was arranged, but the girl, being very delicate, died on the way to the bridegroom's house. On learning the news of her death he was sorely grieved and gave himself up to despair. The Buddha, seeing his capabilities, visited his home and preached to him. At the end of the sermon he became a Stream-enterer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story in which this account is given is called Anitthigandhakumára Vatthu. DhA.iii.281-4. Compare with this the story of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusa_jat_531')"&gt;Kusa Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Anitthigandhakumára.&lt;/b&gt;-A Pacceka Buddha. He was the son of the King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. In a previous birth he had been a </data>
<data>monk for 20,000 years, during the dispensation of Kassapa Buddha. His story is very similar to that of No. 3 above, the wife chosen being the daughter of Maddava, King of Ságala. When the princess died, on her way to be married, the prince gave himself up to contemplation and became a Pacceka Buddha (SnA.67ff.; ApA.i.126-7). A stanza attributed to him is included in the Khaggavisána Sutta. Sn.p.6, v.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In his begging village was an upásiká who looked after him like her own son. One day the Elder, while on his begging rounds, heard her giving orders to her daughter regarding his food. He realised that the woman was undergoing great privations in order to provide him with luxuries, and feeling that he was unworthy of such attention, went back to Kassakalena and sat down on his couch, determined not to rise till he had become an arahant. During the night his object was achieved and the deva in the cave uttered his praise in song. The following morning he went as usual for his alms and the upásiká knew that he had realised his quest (DA.iii.790-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also called Mahámitta.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Anáthapindika&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A banker (setthi) of Sávatthi who became famous because of his unparalleled generosity to the Buddha. His first meeting with the Buddha was during the first year after the Enlightenment, in Rájagaha (the story is given in Vin.ii.154ff; SA.i.240ff, etc.), whither Anáthapindika had come on business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife was the sister of the setthi of Rájagaha, and when he arrived he found the setthi preparing a meal for the Buddha and his monks on so splendid a scale that he thought that a wedding was in progress or that the king had been invited. On learning the truth he became eager to visit the Buddha, and did so very early the next morning (Vin.ii.155-6). He was so excited by the thought of the visit that he got up three times during the night. When, at last, he started for Sítavana, the road was quite dark, but a friendly Yakkha, Sívaka, sped him on with words of encouragement. By force of his piety the darkness vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha was staying in the Sítavana, and when Anáthapindika reached there spirits opened the door for him. He found the Buddha walking up and down, meditating in the cool air of the early dawn. The Buddha greeted him and talked to him on various aspects of his teaching. Anáthapindika was immediately converted and became a Sotápanna. He invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, providing everything himself, although the setthi, the Mayor of Rájagaha and King Bimbisára asked to be allowed to help. After the meal, which he served to the Buddha with his own hand, he invited the Buddha to spend the rainy season at Sávatthi, and the Buddha accepted, saying &quot;the Tathágatas, o householder, take pleasure in solitude.&quot; &quot;I understand, o Blessed One, I understand,&quot; was the reply.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Anáthapindika had finished his business at Rájagaha he set out towards Sávatthi, giving orders along the way to his friends and acquaintances to prepare dwellings, parks, rest-houses and gifts all along the road to Sávatthi in preparation for the Buddha's visit. He had many friends and acquaintances and he was ádeyyavaco (his word was held to be of weight), loc. cit., p.158. But see J.i.92, where it is said that Anáthapindika bore all the expenses of these preparations. Viháras were built costing l,000 pieces each, a yojana apart from each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the request implied in the Buddha's words when he accepted the invitation, Anáthapindika looked out for a quiet spot near Sávatthi where the Buddha and the monks might dwell, and his eye fell on the park of Jetakumára. He bought the park at great expense and erected therein the famous Jetavanáráma. As a result of this and of his numerous other benefactions in the cause of the Sásana, Anáthapindika came to be recognised as the chief of alms-givers (A.i.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anáthapindika's personal name was Sudatta, but he was always called Anáthapindika (AA.i.208; MA.i.50) (feeder of the destitute) because of his munificence; he was, however, very pleased when the Buddha addressed him by his own name (Vin.ii.156). He spent eighteen crores on the purchase of Jetavana and a like sum on the construction of the vihára; another eighteen crores were spent in the festival of dedication. He fed one hundred monks in his house daily in addition to meals provided for guests, people of the village, invalids, etc. Five hundred seats were always ready in his house for any guests who might come (AA.i.208-9. He fed 1,000 monks daily says DhA.i.128; but see J.iii.119, where a monk, who had come from far away and </data>
<data>had missed the meal hour, had to starve.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anáthapindika's father was the setthi Sumana (AA. loc. cit). The name of Anáthapindika's brother was Subhúti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anáthapindika married a lady called Puññalakkhaná (J.ii.410; J.iii.435, she was the sister of the setthi of Rájagaha. SA.i.240); he had a son Kála and three daughters, Mahá-Subhaddá, Cúla-Subhaddá and Sumaná. (Besides Kála, Anáthapindika had another son, who joined the Order under Subhúti Thera; AA.ii.865). Mention is also made of a daughter-in law, Sujátá by name, daughter of Dhanañjaya and the youngest sister of Visákhá. She was very haughty and ill-treated the servants (J.ii.347).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son, in spite of his father's efforts, showed no piety until he was finally bribed to go to the vihára and listen to the Buddha's preaching (see Kála). The daughters, on the other hand, were most dutiful and helped their father in ministering to the monks. The two elder ones attained to the First Fruit of the Path, married, and went to live with the families of their husbands. Sumaná obtained the Second Fruit of the Path, but remained unmarried. Overwhelmed with disappointment because of her failure in finding a husband, she refused to eat and died; she was reborn in Tusita (DhA.i.128f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bhadraghata Játaka (J.ii.431) tells us of a nephew of Anáthapindika who squandered his inheritance of forty crores. His uncle gave him first one thousand and then another five hundred with which to trade. This also he squandered. Anáthapindika then gave him two garments. On applying for further help the man was taken by the neck and pushed out of doors. A little later he was found dead by a side wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books also mention a girl, Punná, </data>
<data>who was a slave in Anáthapindika's household. On one occasion when the Buddha was starting on one of his periodical tours from Jetavana, the king, Anáthapindika, and other eminent patrons failed to stop him; Punná, however, succeeded, and in recognition of this service Anáthapindika adopted her as his daughter (MA.i.347-8). On uposatha days his whole household kept the fast; on all occasions they kept the pañcasíla inviolate (J.iii.257).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story is told of one of his labourers who had forgotten the day and gone to work; but remembering later, he insisted on keeping the fast and died of starvation. He was reborn as a deva (MA.i.540-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anáthapindika had a business village in Kási and the superintendent of the village had orders to feed any monks who came there (Vin.iv.162f). One of his servants bore the inauspicious name of Kálakanni (curse); he and the banker had been playmates as children, and Kálakanni, having fallen on evil days, entered the banker's service. The latter's friends protested against his having a man with so unfortunate a name in his household, but he refused to listen to them. One day when Anáthapindika was away from home on business, burglars came to rob his house, but Kálakanni with great presence of mind drove them away (J.i.364f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar story is related of another friend of his who was also in his service (J.i.441).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All his servants, however, were not so intelligent. A slave woman of his, seeing that a fly had settled on her mother, hit her with a pestle in order to drive it away, and killed her (J.i.248f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slave girl of his borrowed an ornament from his wife and went with her companions to the pleasure garden. There she became friendly with a man who evidently desired to rob her of her ornaments. On </data>
<data>discovering his intentions, she pushed him into a well and killed him with a stone (J.iii.435).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Anáthapindika's cowherd, Nanda, is given elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the banker's friends were not virtuous; one of them kept a tavern (J.i.251). As a result of Anáthapindika's selfless generosity he was gradually reduced to poverty. But he continued his gifts even when he had only bird-seed and sour gruel. The devata who dwelt over his gate appeared before him one night and warned him of his approaching penury; it is said that every time the Buddha or his monks came to the house she had to leave her abode over the gate and that this was inconvenient to her and caused her to be jealous. Anáthapindika paid no attention to her warnings and asked her to leave the house. She left with her children, but could find no other lodging and sought counsel from various gods, including Sakka. Sakka advised her to recover for Anáthapindika the eighteen crores that debtors owed him, another eighteen that lay in the bottom of the sea, and yet eighteen more lying unclaimed. She did so and was readmitted (DhA.iii.10ff; J.i.227ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anáthapindika went regularly to see the Buddha twice a day, sometimes with many friends (J.i.95ff.; he went three times says J.i.226), and always taking with him alms for the young novices. But we are told that he never asked a question of the Buddha lest he should weary him. He did not wish the Buddha to feel obliged to preach to him in return for his munificence (DhA.i.3). But the Buddha of his own accord preached to him on various occasions; several such sermons are mentioned in the Anguttara Nikáya:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;on the importance of having a   well-guarded mind like a well-protected gable in a house (A.i.261f); </data>
<data>  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;on the benefits the recipient of food   obtains (life, beauty, happiness, strength); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;on the four obligations that make up   the pious householder's path of duty (gihisámikiccáni - waiting on the Order   with robes, food, lodgings, medical requirements. Referred to also in S.v.387,   where Anáthapindika expresses his satisfaction that he had never failed in   these obligations); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;on the four conditions of success that   are hard to win (wealth gotten by lawful means, good report, longevity, happy   rebirth); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;on the four kinds of happiness which a   householder should seek (ownership, wealth, debtless ness, blamelessness)   (these various tetrads are given in A.ii.64ff).&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;on the five kinds of enjoyment which   result from wealth rightfully obtained (enjoyment - experienced by oneself and   by one's friends and relations, security in times of need, ability to pay   taxes and to spend on one's religion, the giving of alms to bring about a   happy rebirth, A.iii.45-6); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the five things which are very   desirable but difficult to obtain (long life, beauty, happiness, glory, good   condition of rebirths, A.iii.47-8); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the five sinful acts that justify a   man's being called wicked (hurting of life, etc. A.iii.204); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the inadvisability of being satisfied   with providing requisites for monks without asking oneself if one also   experiences the joy that is born of ease of mind (evidently a gentle warning   to Anáthapindika, A.iii.206-7).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha preached the Veláma Sutta to encourage Anáthapindika when he had been reduced to poverty and felt disappointed that he could no longer provide luxuries for the monks </data>
<data>(A.iv.392ff). On another occasion the Buddha tells Anáthapindika that the Sotápanna is a happy man because he is free from various fears: fear of being born in hell, among beasts, in the realm of Peta or in some other unhappy state; he is assured of reaching Enlightenment (A.iv.405f, also S.v.387f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere the Buddha tells Anáthapindika that it is not every rich man who knows how to indulge in the pleasures of sense legitimately and profitably (A.v.177ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, however, at least one sutta preached as a result of a question put by Anáthapindika himself regarding gifts and those who are worthy to receive them (A.i.62-3); and we also find him consulting the Buddha regarding the marriage of his daughter, Cola Subhaddá (DhA.iii.466).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anáthapindika died before the Buddha. As he lay grievously ill he sent a special message to Sáriputta asking him to come (again, probably, because he did not want to trouble the Buddha). Sáriputta went with Ananda and preached to him the Anáthapindikováda Sutta (M.iii.258f.; see also S.v.380-7, which contain accounts of incidents connected with this visit). His pains left him as he concentrated his mind on the virtuous life he had led and the many acts of piety he had done. Later he fed the Elders with food from his own cooking-pot, but quite soon afterwards he died and was born in the Tusita heaven. That same night he visited the Buddha at Jetavana and uttered a song of praise of Jetavana and of Sáriputta who lived there, admonishing others to follow the Buddha's teaching. In heaven he will live as long as Visákhá and Sakka (DA.iii.740). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various incidents connected with Anáthapindika are to be found in the Játakas. On one occasion his services were requisitioned to hold an inquiry on a bhikkhuni who had become pregnant </data>
<data>(J.i.148).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when the Buddha went on tour from Jetavana, Anáthapindika was perturbed because there was no one left for him to worship; at the Buddha's suggestion, an offshoot from the Bodhi tree at Gaya was planted at the entrance to Jetavana (J.iv.229).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a brahmin, hearing of Anáthapindika's luck, comes to him in order to find out where this luck lay so that he may obtain it. The brahmin discovers that it lay in the comb of a white cock belonging to Anáthapindika; he asks for the cock and it is given to him, but the luck flies away elsewhere, settling first in a pillow, then in a jewel, a club, and, finally, in the head of Anáthapindika's wife. The brahmin's desire is thus frustrated (J.ii.410f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On two occasions he was waylaid by rogues. Once they tried to make him drink drugged toddy. He was at first shocked by their impertinence, but, later, wishing to reform them, frightened them away (J.i.268).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other occasion, the robbers lay in wait for him as he returned from one of his villages; by hurrying back he escaped them (J.ii.413). Whenever Anáthapindika visited the Buddha, he was in the habit of relating to the Buddha various things which had come under his notice, and the Buddha would relate to him stories from the past containing similar incidents. Among the Játakas so preached are: Apannaka, Khadirahgára, Rohiní, Váruní, Punnapáti, Kálakanni, Akataññú, Verí, Kusanáli, Siri, Bhadraghata, Visayha, Hiri, Sirikálakanní and Sulasá. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anáthapindika was not only a shrewd business man but also a keen debater. The Anguttara Nikáya (A.v.185-9) records a visit he paid to the Paribbájakas when he could think of nothing better to do. A lively debate ensues regarding their views and the views of the Buddha as </data>
<data>expounded by Anáthapindika. The latter silences his opponents. When the incident is reported to the Buddha, he speaks in high praise of Anáthapindika and expresses his admiration of the way in which he handled the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the time of Padumattara Buddha Anáthapindika had been a householder of Hamsavatí. One day he heard the Buddha speak of a lay-disciple of his as being the chief of alms-givers. The householder resolved to be so designated himself in some future life and did many good deeds to that end. His wish was fulfilled in this present life. Anáthapindika is sometimes referred to as Mahá Anáthapindika to distinguish him from Cúla Anáthapindika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When Asurinda heard that Bháradvája (probably the chief of the clan) had entered the Order, he was greatly vexed, and going up to the Buddha he abused him. The Buddha remaining silent, Asurinda thought that he acknowledged defeat. But the Buddha enlightened him, saying that the worse of the two is he who, when reviled, reviles back; he who does not so revile wins a twofold victory: he seeks the good both of himself and of the other (S.i.163f.; SA.i.178).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the uncle undertook to build a gandhakuti for the Buddha, the nephew wished to have a share in the work, but this the uncle would not allow. The former thereupon proceeded to erect a Kuñjarasálá (Elephant Hall), on the site opposite the gandhakuti, adorned with the seven kinds of precious minerals. In the centre of the Kuñjarasálá was a jeweled pavilion beneath which was a Preacher's Seat. At the foot of the seat were set four golden rams, of which there were two more under the foot-rest and six round the pavilion. At the festival of dedication, Avaroja invited the Buddha with sixty-eight thousand monks, giving alms to suffice for four months and various gifts to monks and novices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Avaroja, the nephew, became Mendaka, the famous setthi of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, in the present age (DhA.iii.364ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story similar to that of the two Avarojas is told of Aparájita, uncle and nephew of the same name, who also were householders in the time of Vipassí Buddha. We are told that this nephew also became Mendaka Setthi in his last birth.' We have here, evidently, a confusion of legends (DhA.iv.202-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was built on the site of settlements started by the two Anurádhas on the bank of the Kadamba river, and was founded under the constellation Anurádha, hence the name. MT.293; Mhv.x.76; this tradition seems to have been forgotten later, for in the Mbv. (116) there is a suggestion that the city was so called because it was the dwelling of satisfied people (anurodhijana); or is this mere alliteration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandukábhaya (394-307 B.C.) was the founder of the city, to which he removed the capital from Upatissagáma (Mhv.x.75-7), and there it remained up to the time of Aggabodhi IV. (A.D. 626-41). After a short period it became once more the capital, and continued to be so until the royal residence was removed elsewhere (see Cv.xlvi.34, where the new capital, Pulatthinagara, is first mentioned as a royal residence). It was finally deserted in the eleventh century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandukábhaya beautified the city with the artificial lakes Jayavápi and Abhayavápi. It was round the last-named lake that the king laid out the city, including four suburbs, a cemetery, special villages for huntsmen and scavengers, temples to various pagan deities and residences for the engineer and other officials. Abodes were also provided for devotees of various sects, such as the Jainas, the Ajívakas, wandering monks and brahmins. There were also hospitals and lying-in homes. Guardians of the city (Nagaraguttiká) were appointed, one for the day and another for the night. For a full description see Mhv.x.80-102.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandukábhaya's son and successor, Mutasiva, laid out the beautiful Mahámegha Park with fruit and flowering trees (Mhv.xi.2); this was to the south of the city; between it and the southern wall </data>
<data>of the city was another park called Nandana or Jotivana (Mhv.xv.2, 11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the reign of Piyatissa, who succeeded Mutasiva (when Buddhism had been introduced into the land), the king, together with his nobles and people, erected many noble edifices in support of the new religion. Ten of the most noted were in Anurádhapura (for list see Mhv.xx.17ff), and the Mahámeghavana, which was given over to the Buddhist Sangha, henceforth became the centre of Buddhism in the island. In this park was also planted, by Piyatissa, the branch of the Sacred Bodhi Tree which came from Gayá (for details see Mhv.xviii. and xix).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon afterwards the city was taken by the Tamils but was recaptured by Dutthagámani (101-77 B.C.), the hero of the Mahávamsa. Many chapters of the chronicle are devoted to descriptions of the numerous buildings erected by him in Anurádhapura for the glorification of the national faith (Mhv. xxvi.-xxxvi), chief among them being the Maricavatti-vihára, the Lohapásáda and the Mahá Thúpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years later the Tamils once more overcame the city and held it till Vattagámani (29-17 B.C.) drove them off. In his reign was built the mighty Abhayagiri Thúpa and the vihára attached to it (Mhv.xxxiii.80-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent history of the city is a record of how succeeding kings repaired, added to, or beautified, these various monuments and the steps they took for their preservation. The only later monument of real importance is the Jetavanáráma built by King Mahásena (Mhv.xxxvii.33f ) (A.D. 334-61).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About this time the fame of Anurádhapura as the chief centre of Buddhist culture attracted many visitors from abroad in search of learning. The most famous of these was the great commentator </data>
<data>Buddhaghosa (Mhv.xxxvii.215ff.; also Fa Hien). It was also during this period that Dhátusena (A.D. 460-78) reorganised the water supply of the city and built the Kálavápi (Mhv.xxxviii.42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this time onward the country suffered from a series of dynastic intrigues and civil wars, each party appealing to the Tamils of South India for help and protection. As a result, the district round Anurádhapura was overrun by Tamil freebooters and became impossible to defend; the seat of government was therefore removed to Pulatthipura about the beginning of the ninth century, where it continued, except for a brief interval to the eleventh century. Finally, about A.D. 1300, at a date not exactly known, the whole district was abandoned, having become a kind of no-man's land; it then rapidly relapsed into jungle. For quite a long time, however, and even after Pulatthipura became the state capital, Anurádhapura was regarded as a centre of religious activity, and its monuments were restored from time to time (Mhv.lxxvi.106-20; lxxviii.96f.; xxxxviii.80f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various scraps of information regarding Anurádhapura and its inhabitants are found scattered in the commentaries. E.g., that it had two indakhílas (Sp.iii.299); its main street ran from Thúpáráma, where the chief entrance to the city lay (UdA.238; DA.ii.573).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was famous throughout Jambudípa for its virtuous monks, and men came from there to visit them. E.g., the brahmin who came from Pátaliputta to see Mahánága Thera (AA.i.384).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city wall, which existed at the time the Mahávamsa was written, had been built by King Vasabha (Mhv.xxxv.97), and was, according to the Tíká (p. 654), eighteen cubits in height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Asura&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pali Literature the Asuras are classed among the inferior deities together with the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;supannas, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;gandhabbas, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;yakkhas (DA.i.51), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;garulas and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;nágas (Mil.117). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebirth as an Asura is considered as one of the four unhappy rebirths or evil states (apáyá), the others being niraya, tiracchánayoni and pettivisaya (E.g., It.93; J.vi.595; J.v.186; Pv.iv.11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight between the Devas and the Asuras is mentioned even in the oldest books of the Tipitaka and is described in identical words in several passages (E.g., D.ii.285; S.i.222; iv.201ff; v.447; M.i.253; A.iv.432; also S.i.216ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chief or king of the Asuras is often referred to as Asurinda (*), several Asuras being credited with the role of leader, most commonly, however, Vepacitti (E.g., S.i.222; iv.201ff; J.i.205) and Rahu (A.ii.17, 53; iii.243). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*) &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; was also called Asurinda and   Asurádhipa; see, e.g., J.i.66 (Asurindena pavitthadevanagaram viya) and   J.v.245, where we are told that from the time he conquered the Asuras he was   called Asurádhipa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides these we find Paháráda (A.iv.197, 200) (v.l. Mahábhadda), Sambara (S.i.227), Verocana (S.i.225; probably another name for Ráhu, see DA.ii.689), Bali (D.ii.259), Sucitti (D.ii.269) and Namucí (D.ii.269).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Asuras are spoken of as dwelling in the ocean after having been conquered by Vajira-hattha (Indra, elsewhere, </data>
<data>[J.v.139] called Asurappamaddana) and are called Vásava's brethren, of wondrous powers and of great glory. They were present at the preaching of the Mahá Samaya Sutta (see DA.ii.689). Buddhaghosa says that they were all descendants of an Asura maiden named Sujátá. This cannot be the Sujátá, Vepacitti's daughter, whom Sakka married (J.i.205-6). See also Dánavá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were evidently several classes of Asuras, and two are mentioned in the Pitakas, the Kálakañjakas and the Dánaveghasas. The Dánaveghasas carried bows in their hands. The Kálakañjakas were of fearsome shape (D.ii.259), and were considered the lowest among the Asuras (D.iii.7; see also Kálañkajaka and Vepacitti).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Asuras dwelt in Távatimsa together with the devas. When Magha Mánavaka was born as Sakka, he did not relish the idea of sharing a kingdom with others, and having made the Asuras drunken, he had them hurled by their feet on to the steeps of Sineru. There they tumbled into what came to be known as the Asurabhanava, on the lowest level of Sineru, equal in extent to Távatimsa. Here grew the Cittapátalí tree, and when it blossomed the Asuras knew they were no longer in the deva-world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wishing to regain their kingdom, they climbed Sineru, &quot;like ants going up a pillar.&quot; When the alarm was given, Sakka went out to give battle to them in the ocean, but being worsted in the fight, he fled in his Vejayantaratha. Fearing that his chariot hurt the young Garulas, he had it turned back. The Asuras, thinking that Sakka had obtained reinforcements, turned and fled right into the Asurabhavana. Sakka went back to his city and in that moment of victory, the Vejayantapásáda sprang up from the ground. To prevent the Asuras from coming back again, Sakka set up as guard in five places </data>
<data>Nágas, Garulas, Kumbhandas, Yakkhas and the Four Great Kings. Everywhere were images of Indra bearing the thunderbolt in his hand. (J.i.202-4; DhA.i.272-80; the same story, differing slightly in details, is found in SnA.484-5). There it is said that when Sakka was born among them, the Asuras received him with great cordiality; see also the various incidents of the Asura war mentioned in the Samyutta Nikáya I. 216ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Asuras are sometimes called Pubbadevá (SnA.484) and their kingdom is 10,000 leagues in extent. SnA.485; elsewhere, in the same page, it is given as 100,000 leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Buddhaghosa's time, the bygone lustre of the word Asura (as equivalent to Ahura) seems to have faded. His explanation (SA.i.260) of the name is interesting. When Sakka was born with his followers in the Asura-world (which later became Távatimsa) the Asuras prepared a drink called gandapána. Sakka warned his companions not to drink it, but the Asuras became drunk and were thrown down Sineru. Halfway down they regained consciousness and made a vow never to drink intoxicants (surd) again; hence their name Asura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Commentary (ii.526) defines Asura as bíbhaccha, awful, vile. They had a drum called Álambara (q.v.), made of a crab's claw. They left it behind in their flight from Sakka, and since then Sakka has the use of it (J.ii.344).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story is told by the Buddha (S.2, v.446) of a man who once saw a whole army with its four divisions enter a lotus stalk and the man thought he was mad. But the Buddha says that it was an Asura army in flight. Here the Asuras would seem to be fairies or nature spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Apadána&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thirteenth division of the Khuddaka Nikáya. It is a Buddhist Vitae Sanctorum and contains 547 biographies of monks and forty biographies of nuns, all mentioned as having lived in the time of the Buddha. The Cy. gives details of eleven more theras not found in the text: Yasa, Nadíkassapa, Gayákassapa, Kimbila, Vajjiputta, Uttara, Apara-Uttara, Bhaddaji, Sivika, Upavána and Ralthapála. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, there are two introductory chapters, the Buddhá-padána and the Paccekabuddhá-padána, dealing with the Buddha and the Pacceka Buddhas respectively. It is worth noting that the Buddhá-padána contains no account of the Buddha's life, either as Gotama or earlier, as Bodhisatta (see, however, Pubbakammapiloti). Nor does the Paccekabuddhá-padána contain any life-histories. The stanzas are what might be more appropriately described as udána, and appear in the Khaggavisána Sutta of the Sutta Nipáta. Cp. the Mahápadána Sutta (D.ii.1ff), where the word Apadána is used as meaning the legend or life-story of a Buddha or a Great One - in this case the seven Buddhas. Or does Mahápadána mean the Great Story, i.e. the story of the Dhamma and its bearers and promulgation: cp. the title of the Mahávastu (Dial.ii.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the stories are found in the Paramatthadípaní, the Commentary to the Thera- and Therígáthá, extracted from the Apadána with the introductory words, &quot;tena vuttam Apadáne.&quot; But in numerous instances the names under which the verses appear in the Paramatthadípaní differ from those subjoined to the verses in the Apadána. In several cases it is a matter of the Commentary giving a name while the Apadána gives only a title. E.g., Usabha Thera (ThagA.i.320), called Kosumbaphaliya (Ap.ii.449); and </data>
<data>Isidinna (ThagA.i.312), called (Ap.ii.415) Sumanavíjaniya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the stories are duplicated in the Apadána itself, the same story occurring in two places with a very slight alteration in words, even the name of the person spoken of being the same. Most often no reason can be assigned for this, except, perhaps, careless editing. E.g., Annasamsávaka i Ap.i.78 and again i.261; see also the Introduction to the P.T.S. Edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána is regarded as one of the very latest books in the Canon, one reason for this view being that while later books like the Buddhavamsa mention only twenty-four Buddhas previous to Gotama, the Apadána contains the names of thirty-five. It is very probable that the different legends in the collection are of different dates. On these and other matters connected with the Apadána, see Rhys Davids article in ERE. and Muller's Les Apadánas du Sud (Congress of Orientalists, Leyden, 1895).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Sumangala Vilásiní (i.15. See also Przyluski: La Legende de l'Empereur Acoka, pp. viii f., 214), the Díghabhánakas, who included the Khuddaka Nikáya in the Abhidhammapitaka, did not recognise the Apadána. The Majjhimabhánakas included it in the Khuddaka Nikáya, which they regarded as belonging to the Suttapitaka. There is a Commentary to the Apadána called the Visuddhajanavilásiní.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Gv. (p. 69) the Commentary on the Apadána was written by Buddhaghosa at the request of five monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It consists of ten suttas containing the classification of four kinds of individuals to be found in the world, with more or less detailed descriptions of them (A.ii.91-101).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asura Sutta.-The first of the Asura Vagga. Four individuals exist in the world: the asura (a) with a retinue of asuras, (b) with a retinue of devas; the deva (a) with a retinue of devas, (b) with a retinue of asuras. The first is himself immoral, as is his company, and so on correspondingly with the others (A.ii.91).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On his way to his parents to obtain, at Sankicca's behest, permission for the higher ordination, he was attacked by thieves; he was set free on promising not to mention their whereabouts. Later, he saw his parents take the same road, but refrained from warning them on account of his promise. The thieves, marvelling at his integrity, wished to be ordained under him. He took them to Sankicca and later on to the Buddha. DhA.ii.252-3; SA.i.44-5; but see ThagA.ii.11f., where his encounter with the thieves is mentioned as having taken place after he became arahant. The rest of the story also is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Atthadassi's time he was a rich householder and held great almsgivings for the monks after the Buddha's death (Ap.i.88).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is mentioned as one who shone in the assembly of relatives (SA.i.45).

A young brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; came to study under him and, after completing his course, went back home. His mother, however, was anxious that he should renounce the world and tend Aggibhagavá in the forest. She accordingly sent him back to the Teacher that he might learn the &quot;Asátamanta&quot; (Dolour Text). The Teacher had a mother aged 120 years, on whom he himself waited. When the youth came back to learn the Asátamanta, he was asked to look after the old woman. She, falling in love with him, hatched a plot to kill her son. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, having been told of this plot, made a wooden figure and placed it in his bed. The mother, thinking to kill her son, struck it with an axe, and discovering that she had been betrayed, fell down dead. The youth, having thus learnt the Asátamanta, returned to his parents and became a hermit. Kápilání was the mother in the story, Mahá Kassapa the father and Ananda the pupil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, together with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ummadantii_jat_527')"&gt;Ummadantí Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, was related to a passion-tossed monk to warn him of the evil nature of women.

Anáthapindika Sutta.-Similar to the Anáthapindikováda Sutta (infra), but the greater part of this discourse is taken up with the words of consolation, courage and suggestion addressed by Sáriputta to the banker, and we are told that his pains were allayed. No mention is made of the advice not to cling to matters mundane, nor of the death of the banker almost immediately afterwards. Instead, it is stated that Sáriputta and Ananda were given a meal from the banker's own cooking-pot and that they went away after thanking him. Ananda reports to the Buddha the news of their visit, and the Buddha praises Sáriputta for his wisdom. S.v.380-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Anáthapindika Sutta.-The same as the above, but Ananda is given as the admonisher and Anáthapindika is made to claim that he had not violated a single one of the obligations binding on a householder (gihisámícakáni sikkhápadáni). S.v.385-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Anáthapindika Sutta.-Records a visit paid by Anáthapindika to the Buddha, who tells him of the five kinds of guilty dread (pañca-bhayáni veráni) which are allayed in the Ariyan disciple, and of the four limbs of the Stream-winner (sotápattiyangáni). S.v.387-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anáthapindika Vagga.-The second chapter of the Devaputta Samyutta of the Samyutta Nikáya contains a series of verses spoken before the Buddha on various occasions by devas, the last of them being Anáthapindika (reborn in the deva world).

She had been his wife in former births as well and had helped him in his good works. In this age she was of equal birth with Mahákappina and became his chief consort. She was so called because her complexion was the colour of anoja-flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kappina made his renunciation, she and her companions followed him in chariots, crossing rivers by an act of truth (saccakiriyá), saying &quot;the Buddha could not have arisen only for the benefit of men, but for that of women as well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she saw the Buddha and heard him preach, she and her companions became Stream-enterers. She was ordained by Uppalavanná (AA.i. pp.176ff. ; SA.ii., pp.178ff). In the Visuddhimagga it is said that Mahákappina was present when she heard the Buddha preach, but the Buddha contrived to make him invisible. When she asked whether the king was there, the Buddha's reply was &quot;Would you rather seek the king or the self?&quot; &quot;The self &quot; was the answer (p.393. The conversation on the &quot;self&quot; seems to have been borrowed from Vin.i.23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Anojá.-See Anujjá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Asoka.&lt;/b&gt;-King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;. He was the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bindusara')"&gt;Bindusára&lt;/a&gt;. Bindusára had sixteen wives who bore him 101 sons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief Páli sources of information regarding Asoka are Dípavamsa (chaps. i., v., vi., vii., xi., etc.), Mahávamsa (v., xi., xx., etc.), Samantapásádiká (pp. &lt;st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="35 ff"&gt;35 ff&lt;/st2:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;. ). Other sources are the Divyávadána passim, and the Avadánasataka ii.200ff. For an exhaustive discussion of the sources and their contents see Prszlyski, La Legende de l'Empereur Asoka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Páli Chronicles (Dípavamsa and Mahávamsa) mention only three of the sons, viz. Sumana (Susíma according to the northern legends) the eldest, Asoka, and Tissa (uterine brother of Asoka) the youngest. The Mahávamsa Tíka (p.125; Mbv.98. In the northern tradition, e.g., Asokávadánamálá, she is called Subhadrángí, daughter of a brahmin of Campá) gives the name of his mother as Dhammá and calls her Aggamahesí (Bindusára's chief queen); she belonged to the Moriyavamsa. The preceptor of Dhammá's family was an Ájívaka called Janasána (which probably explains Asoka's earlier patronage of the Ájívakas).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his youth Asoka was appointed Governor of Avanti with his capital at Ujjeni. The Divy. says he was in Takkasilá with headquarters in Uttarápatha, where he superseded Susíma and quelled a rebellion. When Bindusára lay on his death-bed, Asoka left Ujjeni and came to Pátalíputta where he made himself master of the city and possessor of the throne. He is stated in the Mahávamsa (v.20; Mbv.98) to have killed all his brothers except Tissa that he might accomplish his purpose, and to have been </data>
<data>called Candásoka on account of this outrage (Mhv.v.189). It is impossible to say how much truth there is in this account of the accession. Asoka's Rock Edicts seem to indicate that he had numerous brothers, sisters and relations alive at the time they were written in Pátaliputta and other towns (see Mookherji, Asoka, pp. 3-6). His brother Tissa he appointed as his uparája (Mhv.v.33), but Tissa (q.v.) became a religious devotee attaining arahantship. The Theragáthá Commentary refers to another younger brother of Asoka, Vitasoka, who also became an arahant (i.295f. The northern works give quite a different account of his brothers. See Mookherji, p.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asoka had several wives. His first wife was the daughter of a merchant of Vedisagiri, whom he met when stopping at the merchant's house on his way to Ujjeni (Mhv.xiii.8ff). Her name was Deví, also called Vedisa-Mahádeví, and she was a Sákyan, descended from a Sákyan family who migrated to Vedisa to escape from Vidúdabha (Mbv., pp.98, 116). Of Deví were born a son Mahinda, and a daughter Sanghamittá, who became the wife of Aggibrahmá and mother of Sumana. Deví evidently did not follow Asoka to Pátaliputta, for his aggamahesí there was Asandhamittá (Mhv.v.85). Asandhamittá died in the thirtieth year of Asoka's reign, and four years later he raised Tissarakkhá to the rank of queen. Mhv.xx.1-3. The Allahabad Pillar Inscription mentions another queen, Káruvákí, mother of Tivara. The Divy. (chap. xxvii.) gives another, Padmávatí, Kunála's mother. Besides the children mentioned above, names of others are given: Jalauka, Cárumatí (Mookherji. p.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Mahávamsa (v.21, 22), Asoka's accession was 218 years after the Buddha's death and his coronation was four years later. The chronicles (v.22ff) contain various stories of his miraculous powers. His command spread a yojana into the air and a yojana under </data>
<data>the earth. The devas supplied him daily with water from the Anotatta Lake and with other luxuries from elsewhere. Yakkhas, Nágas and even mice and karavíka birds ministered to his comfort, and thoughtful animals came and died outside his kitchen in order to provide him with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first Asoka maintained the alms instituted by his father, but soon, being disappointed in the recipients, he began looking out for holy men. It was then that he saw from his window, his nephew, the young novice Nigrodha. Owing to their friendship in a past birth (Asoka, Devanampiyatissa and Nigrodha had been brothers, traders in honey, and they gave honey to a Pacceka Buddha. Asandhamittá had been the maiden who showed the honey-shop to the Pacceka Buddha. The story is given in Mhv.v.49ff), Asoka was at once drawn to him and invited him into the palace. Nigrodha preached to him the Appamádavagga and the king was greatly pleased. He ceased his benefactions to other religious orders and transferred his patronage to Nigrodha and members of the Buddhist Order. His wealth, which, according to the Samantapásádiká (i.52), amounted to 500,000 pieces daily, he now spent in doing acts of piety - giving 100,000 to Nigrodha to be used in any manner he wished, a like sum for the offering of perfumes and flowers at the Buddha's shrines, 100,000 for the preaching of the Dhamma, 100,000 for the provision of comforts for members of the Order, and the remainder for medicines for the sick. To Nigrodha, in addition to other gifts, he sent sets of robes three times each day, placing them on the back of an elephant, adorned by festoons of flowers. Nigrodha gave these robes to other monks (MA.ii.931).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having learnt from Moggaliputta-Tissa that there were 84,000 sections of the Dhamma, he built in various towns an equal number of viháras, and in Pátaliputta he erected the Asokáráma. With the </data>
<data>aid of the Nága king Mahákála, he created a life-size figure of the Buddha, to which he made great offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His two children, Mahinda and Sanghamittá, aged respectively twenty and eighteen, he ordained under Moggaliputta-Tissa and Dhammapálá, in the sixth year of his reign (MA.v.197, 209). This raised him from a paccadáyaka to a sásanadáyádin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to purge the Order of undesirable monks and heretical doctrines, Moggaliputta-Tissa held the Third Council under the king's patronage. It is said that the pious monks refused to hold the uposatha with those they considered unworthy. The king, desirous of bringing about unity in the Sangha, sent a minister to restore amity, but the minister, misunderstanding his orders, beheaded many holy monks, being at last stopped by the king's brother Tissa, who was then a monk (MA.vs.240ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the Council, held in the seventeenth year of his reign (Ibid., 280; in the northern texts Moggaliputta-Tissa's name is given as Upagupta. It was for this Council that the Kathávatthu was written), Asoka sent forth theras to propagate the Buddha's religion: Majjhantika to Kasmíra and Gandhára, Mahádeva to Mahisamandala, Rakkhita to Vanavása, Yona Dhammarakkhita to Aparantaka, Mahárakkhita to Yona, Majjhima to the Himálaya country and Sona and Uttara to Suvannabhúmi; Mahinda with Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasála he sent to Lanká (Ibid., xii.1-8. For particulars of these missions and identification of the places mentioned, see under the different names; this list appears also in the Samantapásádiká, where further interesting details are given. For a discussion on them see Mookherji, pp.33ff). In the eighteenth year of his reign he sent to Lanká, at Devanampiyatissa's request, Sanghamittá, with a branch of the great Bodhi Tree at Buddhagayá (Mhv.xx.1). A little earlier he had sent by his grandson Sumana, </data>
<data>some relics of the Buddha and the Buddha's alms-bowl to be deposited in the thúpas of Lanká (Mhv.xvii.10f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asoka reigned for thirty-seven years (Mhv.xx.6). In his later life he came to be called Dhammásoka on account of his pious deeds (Mhv.v.189). The Dípavamsa gives his name in several places as Piyadassí. E.g., vi.1, 2, 25. The title Devánampiya used by Asoka in his inscriptions was also used by Tissa, Asoka's contemporary in Ceylon, and by Asoka's grandson Dasaratha (Nágarjuní Hill Cave Inscription). It was used also by other kings in Ceylon: Vankanásika Tissa, Gajabáhukagáminí and Mahallaka-Nága (Ep. Zeyl. i.60.f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chronicles state that Asoka and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devaanampiyatissa')"&gt;Devanampiya Tissa&lt;/a&gt; of Ceylon had been friends - though they had never seen each other - even before Mahinda's mission to Ceylon. Tissa had sent him, as a friendly gesture, various gifts, and Asoka had returned the courtesy. He sent an embassy of his chosen ministers, bearing gifts marvellous in splendour, that Tissa might go through a second coronation ceremony, and the messengers were directed to give this special message to the king: &quot;I have taken refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha and declared myself a follower of the religion of the Sákyaputta. Seek then, even thou, oh best of men, converting thy mind with believing heart, refuge in these best of gems.&quot; (Mhv.xi.18-36)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milindapanha (p.121) mentions an encounter of Asoka with a courtesan of Pátaliputta, Bindumatí, who, in order to show the king the power of an Act of Truth, made the waters of the Ganges to flow back. According to the Petavatthu Atthakathá (244ff) there was a king of Surattha, called Pingala, who used to visit Asoka in order to give him counsel. Perhaps he was an old friend or tutor of the king.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Asoka is called a dípacakkavatti as opposed to padesarájás like Bimbisára and Pasenadi (Sp.ii.309).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asoka had three palaces for the three seasons: Mahásappika, Moragíva and Mangala (Ras.i.93).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Asoka.&lt;/b&gt;-See Kálásoka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Asoka.&lt;/b&gt;-See Vításoka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Asoka.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin in the time of Kassapa Buddha. He provided eight meals daily for the monks and entrusted the distribution of them to his serving-woman Bíraní. Mhv.xxvii.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Asoka.&lt;/b&gt;-Attendant to Vipassí Buddha (J.i.41; Bu.xx.28). He was once ill and was cured by a doctor who, in this age, was Tikicchaka (Tekicchakání) Thera. Ap.i.190; ThagA.i.442.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Asoka.&lt;/b&gt;-The chief disciple of the future Buddha Metteyya (Anágatavamsa. v.97). According to the Mahávamsa (xxxii.81) he should be identified with Dutthagámaní.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Asoka.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk of Ñátiká. Once when the Buddha was staying at Ñátiká in the Giñjakávasatha, Ananda mentions to the Buddha that Asoka Thera had died, and asks where he had gone. The Buddha tells him that Asoka was an arahant and had realised Nibbana. S.i.358.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Asoka.&lt;/b&gt;-See Anoma (7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9.

Cowell sees in this story the kernel of a nature-myth (Játaka, trans. iv. 51 n. ); cf. with this the Krsna legend in the Harivamsa; see also Wilson's Visnu Purána (Hall's Ed.), v. 147f.; and the article on Krsna in Hopkins' Epic Mythology, pp.214f. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had also a sister, &lt;a href="anjanadevi')"&gt;Añjanadeví&lt;/a&gt;. When they grew up they became highway robbers, seizing even a present sent to their uncle, King Kamsa. Thus they became notorious as the Andakavenhudásaputtá. The king, having learnt of their true descent, devised various plans for their destruction. Two famous wrestlers, Cánura and Mutthika, were engaged to have a public wrestling match with them. The brothers accepted the challenge and looted several shops for clothes, perfumes, etc., to be used for the occasion. Baladeva </data>
<data>killed both the wrestlers. In his death-throes Mutthika uttered a prayer to be born as a Yakkha; his wish was fulfilled and he was born as such in the Kálamattiya forest. When the king's men attempted to seize the brothers, Vásudeva threw a wheel which cut off the heads of both the king and his brother the viceroy, Upakamsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The populace, terrified, begged the brothers to be their guardians. Thereupon they assumed the sovereignty of &lt;a href="asitanjana')"&gt;Asitañjana&lt;/a&gt;. From there they set out to conquer the whole of Jambudípa, starting with Ayojjhá (whose king, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalasena')"&gt;Kálasena&lt;/a&gt;, they took prisoner) and Dváravatí, which they captured with the help of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kanhadiipayana')"&gt;Kanhadípayana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made Dváravatí their capital and divided their kingdom into ten shares, forgetting their sister, Añjanadeví. When they discovered their mistake, Ankura gave her his share and took to trade. Ankura's later history is found in PvA.111ff. See &lt;a href="ankura')"&gt;Ankura&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In course of time the brothers had many sons and daughters, the average human age at that time being 20,000 years. Later their sons annoyed the sage Kanhadípáyana by dressing up a lad as a woman and asking him what child she would bring forth. &quot;A knot of acacia wood,&quot; he answered, &quot;with which will be destroyed the line of Vasudeva.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They laughed at the sage and kicked him. On the seventh day the lad voided from his belly a knot of acacia wood which they burnt, casting the ashes into the river. From those ashes, which stuck near the citygate, an Eraka-plant sprang up. One day, while disporting themselves in the water, the kings, with their families and followers, started a sham quarrel and plucked leaves from the Eraka-plant to use as clubs. The leaves turned into </data>
<data>weapons in their hands, and they were all killed except Vásudeva, Baladeva, Añjanadeví, and their chaplain, all of whom fled in a chariot. Thus were the words of the sage fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their flight they reached the Kálamattiya forest in which Mutthika had been born as a Yakkha. When Mutthika saw Baladeva he assumed the shape of a wrestler and challenged him to a fight. Baladeva accepted the challenge and &quot;was gobbled up like a radish-bulb.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vásudeva proceeded on his way with the others and at night lay in a bush for shelter. A huntsman, mistaking him for a pig, speared him; when Vásudeva heard that the huntsman's name was Jará (Old Age) he reconciled himself to death. Thus they all perished except Añjanadeví (J.iv.79ff), of whose later history nothing is mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumbha_jat_512')"&gt;Kumbha Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v. p.18) it is suggested that the Andhakavenhus were destroyed as a result of indulging in drink. This story was evidently well known to tradition as it is so often referred to. E.g., in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankicca_jat_530')"&gt;Sankicca Ját&lt;/a&gt;.

Assaka.&lt;/b&gt;-A king mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nimi_jat_541')"&gt;Nimi Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, in a list of kings, such as Dudípa, Ságara, Sela, etc., who, in spite of all their great sacrifices, were not able to go beyond the Peta-world. J.vi.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Assaka.&lt;/b&gt;-King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/potali')"&gt;Potali&lt;/a&gt; in the kingdom of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaasi')"&gt;Kási&lt;/a&gt;. His queen consort &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ubbarii')"&gt;Ubbarí&lt;/a&gt; was very dear to him, and when she died he was plunged into grief. He put her corpse in a coffin, placed it under his bed and lay thereon, starving for seven days. The Bodhisatta was then an ascetic in the Himálaya, and just at this time he visited Potali. There, in the royal park, the king came to see him because he was told that the ascetic would show him Ubbarí. The Bodhisatta showed him Ubbarí now reborn as a dung-worm in the park, because, being intoxicated with her own beauty, she had done no good deeds. Seeing the king incredulous, the ascetic made her speak, and she declared that she cared much more for the dung-worm, who was now her mate, than for Assaka who had been her husband in her previous life. Assaka went back to the palace, had the body disposed of, married another queen and lived righteously. J.ii.155-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Assaka.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Potanagara in the Assaka country, soon after the Buddha's death. He was the father of Sujáta and had two wives. He bequeathed his kingdom to the son of the younger wife (VvA.259-60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="aruna')"&gt;Aruna&lt;/a&gt; (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Assaka.&lt;/b&gt;-The country of Assaka is one of the sixteen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada')"&gt;Mahájanapadas&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.i.213; iv.252, </data>
<data>256, 260). It does not, however; occur in the list of twelve countries given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/janavasabha')"&gt;Janavasabha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. The Assakas are said to have had settlements on the Godávarí, and Bávarí's hermitage (Sn.v.977) was in their territory, in close proximity to the Alaka or Mulaka (the district round Paithan) (Law, Early Geography, 21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is mentioned with Avanti (J.v.317) in the same way as Anga with Magadha, and its position in the list between Súrasena and Avanti makes it probable that when the list was drawn up, its position was immediately to the north-west of Avanti. It is probable, in that case, that the Godávarí settlement, in the Dakkhinápatha, was a later colony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Assaka Játaka (J.ii.155) mention is made of a king Assaka whose realm was in the kingdom of Kásí. It is significant, in this connection, that the capital of Assaka, variously called Potana (E.g., D.ii.235; J.iii.3) or Potali (E.g., J.ii.155), is not mentioned in the reference to the Godávarí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Culla Kálinga Játaka (J.iii.3-5), at one time the King of Assaka (Arum) accepted the challenge of King Kálinga of Dantapura to war, and defeated him. Later Assaka married Kálinga's daughter and the relations between the two countries were amicable. In the Háthigumphá Inscription of Kháravela it is related that Kháravela, regardless of King Sátakarní, sent a large army to the west (pachime disam) to strike terror into Assaka (or Asika) nagara. Law (Op.cit., p.21) thinks that the Assaka of the Culla Kálinga Játaka, the Asikanagara of the Háthigumphá Inscription and the Assaka of the Sutta Nipáta are one and the same place. This would probably be correct if Potana and Potali were regarded as two different cities, capitals of two different settlements having the same name.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Sanskrit authors speak of both Asmaká and Asvaká. It is not possible to say whether these represent two distinct tribes or whether they are variant names for the same people. Asanga mentions Asmaka in his Sútrálankára as a territory on the basin of the Indus. This would make it identical with the Assakenus of Greek writers, that is to the east of the Sarasvati, about twenty-five miles from the sea on the Swat valley. Pánini mentions the Asmakas (iv.173). The Márkandeya Purána and the Brhat Samhitá place Assaka to the north-west. The Assaka capital, Potana, it has been suggested, is the Paudanya of the Mahábhárata (i.77, 47). In the Commentary to Kautilya's Arthasásta, Bhattasvámi identifies Asmaka with Mahárástra (Law, op. cit., 22).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the Buddha's death, a King Assaka was the ruler of Potali, and he and his son Sújata were converted by Mahá Kaccáná (VvA.259-67).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of King Renu, the Assaka king of Potana was Brahmadatta (D.ii.236).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Buddha's time the Assaka king is described as an Andhakarájá. He took a thousand for the plot of land sold for Bávarí's hermitage (SnA.ii.581).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

To refute his views, the Buddha went there and sat in the air above the Brahmá, flames radiating from his body. The Buddha was followed by Moggallána, Mahákassapa, Mahákappina and Anuruddha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahmá was at first agitated by their presence, but later he was delighted on learning from Moggallána, who was questioned by an attendant Brahmá, that there were many more disciples of the Buddha who could do as he and the others had done, and that they were holy men. S.i.144-6. See also Bakabrahma Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the two Damilas, Sena and Guttaka, conquered Súratissa and captured the throne, Asela defeated them and reigned in Anurádhapura for ten years (155-145 B.C.). (Mhv.xxi.11; Cv.lxxxii.20; Epy. Zeyl. iii., Introd., p.5, n.1). He was ultimately conquered by Elára (Mhv.xxi.13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asela was one of nine brothers, the others being Abhaya, Devánampiyatissa, Uttiya, Mahásíva, Mahánága, Mattábhaya, Súratissa and Kíra (MT. 425). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He built a cetiya in the Asokamálaka (MT. 358).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Ayoniso (or Vitakkita) Sutta.-A certain monk staying in a forest tract in Kosala was occupied with evil and wrongful thoughts. The deva of the forest, desiring his welfare, drew near and admonished him to give up his muddled ways and fix his thoughts on the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha (S.i.203).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ayoniso Sutta.-In one who practices unsystematic attention, sensual desires arise afresh and grow; similarly malevolence, sloth and torpor. In him the satipattháná fade away. The reverse happens in the case of the man who practises systematic attention. S.v.84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Araññavásí Nikáya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of monks in Ceylon who seem to have spent most of their time in solitary spots engaged in meditation. They owed allegiance to the Mahávihára. They are first heard of in the sixth century when, in the reign of Aggabodhi II., the King of Kalinga came over to Ceylon and joined the Order under the famous Elder Jotipála. This fraternity seems to have been closely associated with the Buddhists of Kálinga. Among famous scholars belonging to it were: Ananda Vanaratanatissa, Vedeha, Cola Buddhappiya, Culla Dhammapála, Medhankara, his pupil Ananda and Siddhattha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Araññavásins were specially esteemed by Parakkamabáhu of Dambadeniya.

According to the Lalita Vistara, the river was only six yojanas from the city, and Cunningham accepts this (p. &lt;st1:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="485 ff"&gt;485 ff&lt;/st1:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;). It was eight usabhas in breadth, but&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kanthaka cleared it in one leap. It was here that Gotama cut off his hair and beard and put on the orange garments of the ascetics, brought to him by the Brahmá Ghatikára.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its banks was the mango grove of Anupiya (J.i.64f.; SnA.382). Three kingdoms lay between it and Kapilavatthu. (BuA.5. The countries of the Sákiyans, Koliyans and Mallas; see Expositor i.43n., where Kapilavatthu, Devadaha and Koliya are mentioned as the three kingdoms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the river to Rájagaha was a distance of thirty leagues, which Gotama took seven days to walk (J.i.65; SnA.382). It took him a whole night to ride from Kapilavatthu to Anomá (VvA.314).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name seems to have meant &quot;Glorious,&quot; or &quot;not Slight&quot;. See J.i.64, where Gotama asks Channa the name of the river and Channa replies &quot;It is Anoma (glorious).&quot; &quot;Good,&quot; says Gotama, &quot;my renunciation shall also be anomá.&quot; The Burmese name is Anauma (Bigandet. p.41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunningham (*) identifies the river with the modern Aumi. He states his belief that the word means &quot;inferior,&quot; to distinguish it from other and larger rivers in the neighbourhood, and that the original name in Pali was Omá. According to him the confusion in names arose from a misunderstanding of Channa's reply. It is difficult to accept this </data>
<data>suggestion because evidently, according to the tradition quoted in the Játaka commentary and elsewhere, the name of the river was taken as a good augury for the accomplishment of Gotama's desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*) p.486ff.; in the Sutta Nipáta (vv.   153, 177) and again in the Samyutta (i. 33) the Buddha is spoken of as   Anomanáma. Buddhaghosa (SA.i.67) explains this as meaning having no &quot;defect,&quot;   endowed with perfection (sabbagunasamannágatattá avekalla-námam; paripúranámam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas (Loc cit., p. 61 and n.1), on the other hand, suggests that Anomá did not necessarily really exist. There was possibly an actual locality to the east of Kapilavatthu traditionally associated with Gotama's flight. It was probably near Anupiya of the Malla country, and the names given to it, such as Anomá, Anomiya, Anuvaniya, Anumaniya, were corruptions of Anupiya in the popular dialects of the neighbourhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávastu does not mention a river; it only mentions a town, Anomiya, twelve leagues from Kapilavatthu. The names Anuvaineya and Maneya occur in the Lalitavistara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Anomá.-Mother of Nárada Buddha. Bu.x.18; J.i.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He had a friend, Piliyasetthi, in Benares, equally wealthy. Piliya having lost all his wealth, sought the assistance of Sankha, who gave him one-half of all his possessions. Later, Sankha, himself becoming bankrupt, went with his wife to Benares to seek help from Piliya; the latter, however, dismissed him with half a quarter of pollard. On the way back Sankha was recognised by an erstwhile servant of his whom he had given to Piliya. This servant befriended Sankha and his wife, and with the help of his companions, brought to the king's notice Piliya's ingratitude. The king, having tried the case, wished to give all Piliya's wealth to Sankha, but at the latter's request restored to him only what he had, in days of prosperity, given to Piliya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is related in reference to Devadatta's ingratitude.

It deals with the admonishing of monks and with self-examination. It is of interest to note that there is no reference to the Buddha throughout the discourse (M.i.95-100).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says that this discourse was known to the Poráná as the Bhikkhupátimokkha, and adds that this self-examination should take place three times each day (MA.i.294).

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Aputtaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wealthy burgess of Sávatthi who died intestate. In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.89-91) we find Pasenadi, King of Kosala, visiting the Buddha at noonday and telling him that he had just finished having the banker's wealth removed to the royal coffers, &quot;eight millions of gold to say nothing of silver.&quot; And yet Aputtaka ate nothing except sour husk-gruel left over from the previous day and wore only hempen garments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next Sutta of the same Nikáya (S.i.91-3) the Buddha is reported as revealing the banker's past. In a former birth he had given alms to a Pacceka Buddha, Tagarasikhí, but later he repented and wished that he had given the food to slaves and workmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had, in the same birth, slain the only son of his brother for the sake of his fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the alms he was born seven times in the deva-worlds and seven times as a rich man of Sávatthi. His repentance made him inclined to deny himself enjoyment of sense-desires. Owing to the murder of his nephew in his previous birth, he was childless in this, and he died intestate. After this life he was born in Mahároruva purgatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mayhaka Játaka (J.iii.299f.), contains the whole story of the banker's past and present, giving many graphic details not found in the Samyutta account, but it does not mention the seven births in heaven or in Sávatthi. It adds that the king's men took seven days and nights to remove the treasure. Aputtaka is there referred to not as Aputtaka but as Ágantuka (Strange).

It was an exhortation to him not to cling to mundane things. It is said that at the end of the sermon the banker wept aloud, never before having heard such a homily. Soon after, he died and was born as a deva, in which form he came to Jetavana and paid homage to the Buddha (M.iii.258-63).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sutta Sáriputta says that such sermons were not vouchsafed to the white-robed laity but reserved for the duly-ordained (M.iii.261), a statement sometimes quoted as evidence of an esoteric doctrine in Buddhism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anáthapindika makes a request that such suttas should also be preached to laymen because there are young men whose eyes are but slightly dimmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A girl is bred from infancy among women only, never seeing any man but her husband, the king's chaplain. The latter had embarked on the enterprise of so bringing up the girl, in order to defeat the king at dice, because the king was in the habit of winning by a declaration of truth to the effect that all women were treacherous; the chaplain wanted to find an exception in order to falsify the declaration. For a time the experiment succeeds, but later, as a result of the king's scheming, the girl starts an intrigue with a flower-seller as lover and is discovered (J.i.289ff). The Játaka is so called because the woman in the story was guarded from the time she lay in her mother's womb as a foetus (andabhúta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related concerning a monk who was worried by his passions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He also wrote a Páli tika called the Sáratthavikásiní on the Kaccáyanabheda, and he made in Burmese what amounted to a revised edition of Kaccáyana's grammar (Sás.p.110-11; Bode, op. cit., 52-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two others do not seem to have written any works which have been preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Aparagoyána&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the four great continents into which the earth is divided. It is to the west of Sineru and is seven thousand yojanas in extent. It is surrounded by five hundred islands (SnA.ii.443). According to the Anguttara Nikáya (i.227; v.59), each cakkavála (world-system) has an Aparagoyána. It is inhabited by men (KhA.123), but they have no houses and sleep on the ground (ThagA.ii.187-8). In the centre of the continent is a Kadamba tree, whose trunk is fifteen yojanas in girth and whose trunk and arms are fifty yojanas in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tree stands for a whole kappa (DhsA.298; AA.i.264; Vm.206). When the sun rises in Jambudípa, it is the middle watch of the night in Aparagoyána; sunset in Aparagoyána is midnight in Jambudípa, and sunrise is noon in Jambudípa, sunset in Pubbavideha and midnight in Uttarakuru (DA.iii.868). A cakkavatti-king first conquers Pubbavideha in the east and Jambudípa in the south, and then sets out to win Aparagoyána in the west and Uttarakuru in the north (Mbv.73-4; BuA.113). Thus King Mandhátá, having conquered Jambudípa, journeys on with his retinue to Aparagoyána and conquers it straight away (Dvy.215).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punnaka, in his play with Dhanañjaya, staked a jewel, by gazing into which the continent of Aparagoyána could be seen. J.vi.278; so also in the necklace mentioned in the Hárapradána Játaka. (Mtu.ii.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context the name given is Goyániya. So also in the Mahávastu: Aparagodánika, °godániya (ii.159, 378, etc.). In the Dulva it is called Aparagaudani (Rockhill, 84).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the inhabitants came with Mandhátá from Aparagoyána to Jambudípa and settled down there. The country they colonised was called Aparanta. DA.ii.482; MA.i.484.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Atthaka.-A celebrated sage, composer and reciter of sacred runes, mentioned together with nine others (Vámaka, Vámadeva, Vessámitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bháradvája, Vásettha and Bhagu. Vin.i.245; D.i.104; DA.i.273), as the ancient rsis of the brahmins. They abstained from food at unseasonable times. They were the first teachers of the Tevijja Brahmins (D.i.238) and great sacrifices were conducted by them (A.iv.61).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various teachings are attributed to them, e.g. that they recognised five kinds of Brahmins - brahmasama, devasama, mariyáda, sambhinnamariyáda, and bráhmanacandála (A.iii.224ff). These sages did not claim to have discerned and realised the five qualities-truth, austerities, chastity, study and munificence - specified by the brahmins for the attainment of merit and the achievement of what is right (M.ii.199-200), though their followers behaved as if they did. Nor did they claim that they personally saw and knew that &quot;here alone resides the truth and everything else is vain.&quot; (M.ii.169) In the Vimánavatthu Commentary it is said that the Buddha had realised those things of which these sages thought and for which they wished (p.265). (Brahmacintitan ti brahmehi Atthakádíhi cintitam, pañcacakkhuná dittham).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that Atthaka and the other seers had the divine eye and had incorporated the teachings of Kassapa Buddha into their own scriptures. Thus (at that time) the three Vedas were in conformity with the Dhamma. But later the brahmins went back on these teachings (DA.i.273).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atthaka is generally identified with Astaka mentioned as the author of Rg-veda x.104, unless the name be taken as a corrupt reading under which some representation of Atri may lurk.

When Dandaka, having sinned against Kisavaccha, was destroyed with his realm, three of the subordinate lords within his kingdom - Kalinga, Atthaka and Bhímaratha - went to consult the Bodhisatta Sarabhanga on the fate of Dandaka and his fellow-sinners. Their doubts were set at rest, and at the end of Sarabhanga's discourse they became free of their sensuality (kámarága) (J.v.135-49). Sakka himself was present at the interview and asked questions of Sarabhanga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Atthaka.-Pacceka Buddha. Mentioned in a nominal list.

Asita.&lt;/b&gt;-Often called the Buddhist Simeon, though the comparison is not quite correct. He was a sage and the chaplain of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihahanu')"&gt;Síhahanu&lt;/a&gt;, father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt;. He was the teacher of the Suddhodana, and later his chaplain. He came morning and evening to see the king, Suddhodana, who showed him as great respect as he had while yet his pupil; this, we are told, is a characteristic of Sákiyan kings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the king's leave, Asita renounced the world and lived in the king's pleasance. In due course he developed various iddhi powers. Thenceforward he would often spend the day in the deva worlds. Once, while in Távatimsa, he saw the whole city decked with splendour and the gods engaged in great rejoicing. On inquiry he learnt that Siddhattha Gotama, destined to become the Buddha, had been born. Immediately he went to Suddhodana's home and asked to see the babe. From the auspicious marks on its body he knew that it would become the Enlightened One and was greatly overjoyed, but realising that he himself would, by then, be born in an Arúpa world and would not therefore be able to hear the Buddha preach, he wept and was sad. Having reassured the king regarding the babe's future, Asita sought his sister's son, Nalaka, and ordained him that he might be ready to benefit by the Buddha's teaching when the time came. Later Asita was born in the Arúpa world (Sn., pp.131-36; SnA.ii.483ff.; J.i.54f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.483), Asita was so-called because of his dark complexion. He also had a second name, Kanha Devala (SnA.ii.487). Other names for him were Kanha Siri (Sn.v.689), Siri Kanha (SnA.487) and Kála Devala (J.i.54).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;He is evidently to be distinguished from &lt;a href="asita_devala')"&gt;Asita Devala&lt;/a&gt;, also called Kála Devala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lalita Vistara has two versions of Asita's prophecy, one in prose and one in verse, which, in their chief details, differ but slightly from the Páli version. In the former his nephew is called Naradatta, and Asita himself is represented as being a great sage dwelling in the Himálaya but unknown to Suddhodana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is evidently a confusion of his story with that of Asita Devala. In the Mahávastu version (ii.30f) he is spoken of as the son of a brahmin of Ujjeni, and he lives in a hermitage in the Vindhyá mountains. It is noteworthy that in the Játaka version he is called, not an isi, but a tápasa, an ascetic practising austerities. And there we are told that when the king brought the boy, the future Buddha, and prepared to make him do reverence to the ascetic, the babe's feet turned up and placed themselves on the ascetic's head. For there is no one fit to be reverenced by a Bodhisatta, and had they put the babe's head at the feet of the ascetic, the ascetic's head would have split into seven pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tápasa could see forty kappas into the past and forty kappas into the future. J.i.54-5. See Thomas, op. cit., pp.&lt;st1:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="38 ff"&gt;38 ff&lt;/st1:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;., on the growth of the Asita legend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

While taking a garland to the palace, he saw the Buddha and offered it to him. As a result, twenty-five kappas ago he became a king named Dvebhára. In the present age he was known as Sukatáveliya Thera (Ap.i.217).&lt;/p&gt;</data>

Anuruddha Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First cousin of the Buddha and one of his most eminent disciples. He was the son of the Sákyan Amitodana and brother of Mahánáma. When members of other Sákyan families had joined the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mahánáma was grieved that none had gone forth from his own. He therefore suggested to his brother that one of them should leave household life. Anuruddha was at first reluctant to agree, for he had been reared most delicately and luxuriously, dwelling in a different house for each season, surrounded by dancers and mimes. But on hearing from Mahánáma of the endless round of household cares he agreed to go. He could not, however, get his mother's consent until he persuaded his cousin Bhaddiya to go with him. Together they went with Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta and their barber Upáli, to the Blessed One at the Anupiya Mango Grove and were ordained. Before the rainy season was over Anuruddha acquired the dibbacakkhu (Vin.ii.180-3; Mtu.iii.177f), and he was later ranked foremost among those who had obtained this attainment (A.i.23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then received from Sáriputta, as topic of meditation, the eight thoughts of a great man. The list is given in A.iv.228ff. Another conversation he had with Sáriputta before becoming an arahant is reported in A.i.281-2. He went into the Pácínavamsadáya in the Ceti country to practise these. He mastered seven, but could not learn the eighth. The Buddha, being aware of this, visited him and taught it to him. Thereupon Anuruddha developed insight and realised arahantship in the highest grade (A.iv. loc. cit.; AA.108-9; Thag.901).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anuruddha appears in the Suttas as an affectionate and loyal comrade-bhikkhu, full of affection to his kinsman, the </data>
<data>Buddha, who returned his love. In the assembly he stood near the Buddha (Bu.v.60). When the Buddha, disgusted with the quarrels of the Kosambí monks, went away to seek more congenial surroundings, it was to Pácínavamsadáya that he repaired, where were Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila. The Upakkilesa Sutta (M.iii.153f.), on the sweets of concord and freedom from blemish, seems to have been preached specially to Anuruddha on that occasion, for we are told at the end that he was pleased to have heard it, no mention being made of the other two. And again in the Nalakapána Sutta (M.i.462ff.), though a large number of distinguished monks are present, it is to Anuruddha that the Buddha directly addresses his questions, and it is Anuruddha who answers on behalf of them all. See also the Cúla- and the Mahá-Gosinga Suttas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anuruddha was present when the Buddha died at Kusinárá, and knew the exact moment of his death; the verse he uttered on that occasion is thoughtful and shows philosophic calm, in contrast, for example, with that of Ananda. D.ii.156-7. On this see Oldenberg, Nachrichten der Wissenschaften zu Goettingen, 1902, pp.168f.; and Przyluski JA. mai-juin, 1918, pp.486ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anuruddha was foremost in consoling the monks and admonishing them as to their future course of action. It was Anuruddha again that the Mallas of Kusinárá consulted regarding the Buddha's last obsequies (D.ii.160f). Later, at the First Council, he played a prominent part and was entrusted with the custody of the Anguttara Nikáya (DA.i.15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of the verses ascribed to Anuruddha in the Theragáthá (904; ThagA.ii.72) it is said that for twenty-five years he did not sleep at all, and that for the last thirty years of his life he slept only during the last watch of the night. The same source (Thag.908; also S.i.200) mentions an occasion where a goddess, Jáliní (ThagA.ii.73; this story </data>
<data>is given in detail in SA.i.225-6), who had been his wife in a previous birth, seeing him grown old and grey with meditation, seeks to tempt him with the joys of heaven, but he tells her he has no need of such things, having attained to freedom from rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His death took place in Veluvagáma in the Vajji country, in the shade of a bamboo thicket. Thag.919. See also Psalms of the Brethren, p.331, n.1. I cannot trace the reference to Hatthigáma. He was one hundred and fifteen years old at the time of his death (DA.ii.413).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Padumuttara Buddha's time he had been a rich householder. Hearing one of the monks declared best among possessors of the celestial eye, he wished for a similar honour for himself in the future. He did acts of great merit towards that end, including the holding of a great feast of light in front of the Buddha's tomb. In Kassapa Buddha's age he was born in Benares; one day he placed bowls filled with clarified butter all round the Buddha's tomb and lighted them, himself walking round the tomb all night, bearing on his head a lighted bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he was reborn in a poor family in Benares and was named Annabhára (lit. &quot;food-bearer&quot;). One day, while working for his master, the banker Sumana, he gave his meal to a Pacceka Buddha, Uparittha. The banker, having heard from the deity of his parasol of Annabhára's pious deed, rewarded him and set him up in trade. The king, being pleased with him, gave him a site for a house, the ground of which, when dug, yielded much buried treasure. On account of this great accretion of wealth he was given the rank of Dhanasetthi (ThagA.ii.65ff.; Thag.910; DhA.iv.120ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (i.113), as a result of his gift to the Pacceka Buddha, Anuruddha never lacked anything he desired - such had been the wish he expressed. A charming story is </data>
<data>related in this connection. Once when playing at ball with his friends he was beaten and had to pay with sweets. His mother sent him the sweets, but he lost over and over again until no more sweets were to be had. His mother sent word to that effect, but he did not know the meaning of the words &quot;there isn't.&quot; When his mother, to make him understand, sent him an empty bowl, the guardian deity of the city filled it with celestial cakes, so that he should not be disappointed. Thereafter, whenever Anuruddha sent for cakes, his mother would send him an empty vessel, which became filled on the way. See also DhA.iv.124ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadána (i.35) mentions another incident of his past. Once, in Sumedha Buddha's time, Anuruddha, having seen the Buddha meditating alone at the foot of a tree, set up lights round him and kept them burning for seven days. As a result he reigned for thirty kappas as king of the gods, and was king of men twenty-eight times. He could see a distance of a league both by day and night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On various occasions Anuruddha had discussions with the Buddha, and he was consulted by disciples, both monks and laymen, on points of doctrine and practice. In the Anuruddha Sutta (M.iii.144f) he goes with Abhiya Kaccána and two others to a meal at the house of Pañcakanga, the king's carpenter. At the end of the meal the carpenter asks him the difference between that deliverance of the heart (cetovimutti) that is boundless (appamána) and that which is vast (mahaggata). The discussion leads on to an account of the four states of rebirth among the brilliant gods (Ábhá), and in reply to the questions of Abhiya Kaccána, Anuruddha proceeds to explain their nature. At the end of the discourse we find Anuruddha acknowledging that he himself had lived among these gods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.iv.240-5) he </data>
<data>is mentioned as questioning the Buddha about women, how they come to be born in happy states and how in woeful purgatory. A similar inquiry is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikáya. Anuruddha had been visited by some Manápakáyiká devas, who had played and sung to him and shown their power of changing their complexions at will. He comes to the Buddha and asks how women could be born among these devas (A.iv.262ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find him (S.v.174-6, also 299f) being asked by Samyutta and Moggallána about the sekha and asekha and about super-knowledge (abhiññá). In dealing with this passage the Commentary (SA.iii.183) states that Anuruddha used to rise early, and that after ablutions he sat in his cell, calling up a thousand kappas of the past and the future. With his clairvoyant eye he knew the thousand fold universe and all its workings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anuruddha Samyutta (S.v.294) gives an account of a series of questions asked by Moggallána on the satipattháná, their extent, etc. Anuruddha evidently laid great emphasis on the cultivation of the satipattháná, for we find mention of them occurring over and over again in his discourses. He attributes all his powers to their development, and admonishes his hearers to practise them. S.v.299-306. He himself considered the dibbacakkhu as the highest attainment. Thus in the Mahágosinga Sutta (M.i.213) he declares it to be more worthy than knowledge of the doctrine, meditation, forest-life, discourse on the abhidhamma or self-mastery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he lay grievously ill in the Andhavana in Sávatthi, but the pain made no impression on his mind, because, he says, his mind was well grounded in the satipattháná (S.v.302, but see DhA.iv.129, where he suffered from wind in the stomach). Apart from his teaching of the satipattháná, he does not seem to have found fame as a teacher. He was of </data>
<data>a retiring disposition and never interfered in any of the monks' quarrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is often made of Anuruddha's iddhi-powers. Thus, he was one of those who went to the Brahma-world to curb the pride of the Brahma who had thought that no ascetic could reach his world (S.i.145. The others being Moggallána, Mahákassapa and Mahákappina). The mother of the Yakkha Piyankara, while wandering in search of food, heard him at night reciting some verses from the Dhammapada and stood spellbound listening (S.i.209; SA.i.237-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His iddhi, however, does not seem to have enabled him to prevent his fellow-dweller Abhiñjika from talking too much (S.ii.203-4), nor his other fellow-dweller Báhiya from attempting to create dissension in the Order (A.ii.239). Among the Vajjians he seems to have been held particularly in esteem, together with Nandiya and Kimbila. A yakkha named Dígha tells the Buddha how the Vajjians are envied by the inhabitants of the deva and brahma worlds on account of the presence of these distinguished monks in their country (in the Cúlagosinga Sutta, M.i.210).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In numerous Játakas Anuruddha is identified with personalities occurring in the Atítavatthu. In several cases he is mentioned as having been Sakka, the deus ex machina of the story in question. Thus in the Manicora (J.ii.125); Guttila (ii.257); Ayakúta (iii.147); Mahásúka (iii.494); Cullasúka (iii.496); Kanha (iv.14); Akitti (iv.242); Sádhína (iv.360); Siri (iv.412); Mahásutasoma (v.511); Sáma (vi.95); Nimi (vi.129); Mahásumagga (vi.329); Vessantara (vi.593).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere he is identified with different personalities:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;he was Pabbata in the Indriya (iii.469) and in the Sarabhanga (v.151); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the king in the Candakinnara (iv.288); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;one of the seven </data>
<data>brothers in the Bhisa (iv.314); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the dove in the Pañcúposatha (iv.332); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Ajapála in the Hatthipála (iv.491); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sucirata in the Sambhava (v.67); &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Pañcasikha in the Sudhdábojana (v.412) and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the charioteer in the Kurudhamma (ii.381).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anuruddha's name occurs in several of the legends of the Dhammapada Commentary apart from those already mentioned. In the story of Cúlasubhaddá it is stated that after the Buddha had visited Ugganagara at Cúlasubhadda's request and enjoyed her hospitality, Anuruddha was asked to stay behind at Ugganagara for her benefit and that of the new converts (DhA.iii.471). When the Buddha spent a rainy season in Távatimsa preaching the Abhidhamma, it was Anuruddha who kept the people on earth informed of his doings. DhA.iii.218f.; SnA. (ii.570), states that the Buddha went to Távatimsa at Anuruddha's request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sumanasámanera Vatthu (DhA.iv.120ff ) we are told how Anuruddha, having himself attained salvation, sought for his friend and benefactor of a past birth, Sumana-setthi. Sumana-setthi had been born near the Vindhyá forest as Cúllasumana, son of Anuruddha's acquaintance Mahámunda, and Anuruddha ordained him at the age of seven. The lad became arahant in the tonsure-hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Peta Vatthu (Pv., p.27, vv. 58-60), it was by virtue of a spoonful of food given by him to Anuruddha that Indaka entered Távatimsa, and the same gift enabled him to surpass in glory Ankura, who had spent all his wealth in practising generosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anuruddha had a sister, Rohiní, who suffered from a skin disease and, therefore, remained indoors; she would not see the Elder when he visited her relations. But he insisted on seeing her and persuaded her to sell her ornaments and build a resting hall for the Buddha and </data>
<data>his monks. She later became a Stream-enterer and was reborn as Sakka's consort (DhA.iii.295f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Maháyána books Anuruddha's name appears as Aniruddha. In the Lalitavistara he is mentioned as wearing the Bodhisatta's ornaments when the latter renounced the world. He is sometimes spoken of as a son of Dronodana. Thus, e.g., Mtu i.75; iii.117. See Beal, Records of Western World, ii.38 n. for meaning of Anuruddha. According to the Dulva, it was Anuruddha who, finding Ananda still asekha, got him turned out of the First Council until he became an arahant (Rockhill, p.151).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Anuruddha.&lt;/b&gt;-A Pacceka Buddha, to whom Nanda Thera in a previous birth offered a canopy of lotus flowers. Ap.ii.350.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Anuruddha (or Anuruddhaka).&lt;/b&gt;-One of the parricide kings of Magadha. He killed his father Udayabhaddaka and was himself slain by his son Munda. Mhv.iv.2-3; Mbv., p.96; but see DA.i.153, where Anuruddha is given as Mahámunda's son and Nágadása's father. In the Divyávadána (p.359) Anuruddha's name does not appear at all in the list of Bimbisára's successors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Anuruddha.&lt;/b&gt;-Personal attendant of Piyadassi Buddha. It was in reply to his question that the Buddha revealed the future attainments of Nigrodha Thera (ThagA.i.75; Ap.i.431) and of Tissa Thera (ThagA.i.273).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Anuruddha.&lt;/b&gt;-Personal attendant of Kondañña Buddha. Bu.iii.30; J.i.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Anuruddha.&lt;/b&gt;-Author of the Abhidhammattha-sangaha, Paramattha-vinicchaya, Námarúpapariccheda and, perhaps, of the Anuruddha Sataka (Gv.61, 67; SdS. 64; Sas.69). He was an incumbent of the Múlasoma Vihára and probably lived in the eleventh or twelfth century. For details see P.L.C.,s.v.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Anuruddha.&lt;/b&gt;-Teacher of Mahásumma Thera. He once offered to the Sangha a bowl filled with ghee. The incident is mentioned in a discussion as to whether a bowl that had been bought for a particular monk, could be used by the community of monks (Sp.iii.698-9). This bowl had been bought for the Elder, but it was used by the community and was, therefore, kappiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Anuruddha.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Ramañña. He helped Vijayabáhu I. of Ceylon to re-establish the Order in Ceylon. Cv.lx.5-7; see, however, Geiger, Cv. trans. i.214, n.4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also called Anorata. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

This method leads to insight apart from belief, hearsay, etc. S.i.138.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

(S.ii.229). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains that a thunderbolt destroys one life-span only, while gains, etc., bring a man to infinitely prolonged misery.

There was one, for instance, near Rájagaha, where Mahá Moggallána (J.iii.33) used to spend his time and also Mahá Kassapa (J.iii.71). Evidently other monks of the Order dwelt there from time to time, e.g. the novice Aciravata (M.iii.128). There was one hermitage near Díghambalika (DhA.ii.235) and another near Himavá (DhA.ii.31, 129), where the Buddha sometimes went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In this river many mere bathed, and along its banks sat beautiful courtesans tempting them. It was one of these courtesans that tempted the sage Nárada (J.iii.463).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arañjagiri was one of the places passed by Vessantara and his family on their way from their home to Vankagiri. From the city of Jetuttara to Suvannagiritála was five leagues and it was five leagues more to Kontimára; thence to Arañjaragiri was five and again five to Dunni-vittha (J.vi.514).

At that time Vesáli was faced by the threefold terror of drought, disease and demons. The Buddha quelled the panic by preaching the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/ratana_sutta')"&gt;Ratana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;. In the great concourse of listeners was the rájá's son who thereupon left the world.

He was sixteen times born as a king, named Devuttara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Mutthipupphiya of the Apadána (i.142).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Assaji Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya')"&gt;Pañcavaggiya&lt;/a&gt; monks. When the Buddha preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammacakkappavattana')"&gt;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, he was the last in whom dawned the eye of Truth, and the Buddha had to discourse to him and to&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanama_th')"&gt;Mahánáma&lt;/a&gt; while their three colleagues went for alms (Vin.i.13. He became a sotápanna on the fourth day of the quarter, AA.i.84). He became an arahant, together with the others, at the preaching of the &lt;a href="anattalakhana_s')"&gt;Anattalakkhana Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.14; J.i.82). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was responsible for the conversion of Sáriputta and Moggallána. Sáriputta, in the course of his wanderings in search of Eternal Truth, saw Assaji begging for alms in Rájagaha, and being pleased with his demeanour, followed him till he had finished his round. Finding a suitable opportunity, Sáriputta asked Assaji about his teacher and the doctrines he followed. Assaji was at first reluctant to preach to him, because, as he said, he was but young in the Order. But Sáriputta urged him to say what he knew, and the stanza which Assaji uttered then, has, ever since, been famous, as representing the keynote of the Buddha's teaching:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;ye dhammá hetuppabhavá tesam hetum Tathágato áha tesañ ca yo nirodho, evamvádí Mahásamano.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta immediately understood and hurried to give the glad tidings to Moggallána that he had succeeded in his quest. Vin.i.39ff.; the incident is related in the DhA (i.75ff.) with slight variations as to detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sáriputta held Assaji in the highest veneration, and we are told that from the day of this first meeting, in whatever </data>
<data>quarter he heard that Assaji was staying, in that direction he would extend his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent supplication, and in that direction he would turn his head when he lay down to sleep (DhA.iv.150-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day when Assaji was going about in Vesáli for alms, the Nigantha Saccaka, who was wandering about in search of disputants to conquer, saw him, and questioned him regarding the Buddha's teaching because he was a well-known disciple (ñátaññatara-sávaka). Assaji gave him a summary of the doctrine contained in the Anattalakkhana Sutta. Feeling sure that he could refute these views attributed to the Buddha, Saccaka went with a large concourse of Licchavis to the Buddha and questioned him. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Cula-Saccaka Sutta (M.i.227ff). The Commentary (MA.i.452) tells us that Assaji decided on this method of exposition because he did not wish to leave Saccaka any loophole for contentious questioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya (S.iii.124ff) records a visit paid by the Buddha to Assaji as he lay grievously sick in Kassapáráma near Rájagaha. He tells the Buddha that he cannot enter into jhána because of his difficulty in breathing and that he cannot win balance of mind. The Buddha encourages him and asks him to dwell on thoughts of impermanence and non-self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Assaji.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the leaders of the Assaji-Punabbasuká (q.v.), the other being Punabbasu.

While still a young calf he was given by his owners to an old woman, who reared him like a son; hence his name (&quot;Grannie's Blackie&quot;). The village lads used to ride on him for play. Once he saw a merchant trying to get his five hundred carts across a ford; the merchant's bulls were not strong enough for the task, and seeing the Bodhisatta the merchant tried to make use of his services. The Bodhisatta agreed only after he had been promised a thousand. The task completed, the merchant tried to cheat him, paying only half the promised amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bull would not let him go till all the money had been paid. The earnings so obtained he took to the old woman, who was greatly pleased. J.i.194-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

At that time people were in the habit of sacrificing animals to the gods in order to win their favour, but the Bodhisatta proclaimed that no living creature should be slain. Being enraged at the loss of their food, the yakkhas sent one of their number to the Bodhisatta. He came to the Bodhisatta's bed at night meaning to strike him a deadly blow. Thereupon Sakka's throne grew hot, and learning the cause, Sakka himself came and stood guard over the Bodhisatta. The latter saw the yakkha standing over him ready to strike but powerless, and only learnt later, to his great encouragement, that Sakka had been there to protect him (J.iii.145-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for the telling of the story is given in the Mahákanha Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When his elder brother, Sena, left the world and became an arahant under Vipassí Buddha, Aparájita sought his advice as to how he could use his wealth to perform some act of great merit. He was asked to build a Gandhakuti for the Buddha, which he did, using all manner of precious metals and stones and surrounding it with various kinds of luxury, such as perfumed water. The chamber was on three occasions filled knee-deep with jewels to be taken by anyone who came to hear the Buddha preach. At the opening of the Gandhakuti, Aparájita entertained 6,800,000 monks for nine months. In this age he was born as the banker Jotika. In an earlier birth he had given sugar-cane to a Pacceka Buddha.

The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/peta_vatthu')"&gt;Peta Vatthu&lt;/a&gt; (Pv.23ff.; PvA.111ff) contains an account of Ankura's later career. Once he took a caravan of a thousand carts from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dvaaravatii')"&gt;Dváravatí&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kamboja')"&gt;Kamboja&lt;/a&gt;, led by himself and a brahmin colleague. On the way their water supply fails, but they are befriended by a Yakkha of great power, who, in his previous life, had been one of Ankura's trusted and loyal servants. Annoyed by the suggestion of the brahmin that instead of proceeding to Kamboja they should entice the Yakkha back with them to Dváravatí, the Yakkha appears before them in person, and in answer to Ankura's questions, tells him that he had been a tailor in Bheruva, where lived the generous Asayha. When suppliants came in search of Asayha's house, the tailor showed them the way. Impressed by the story, Ankura returns forthwith to Dváravatí, and spends the rest of his life, 60,000 years (10,000 says DhA.(loc infra);Sp.i.245), in acts of unparalleled munificence. (There were as many as 3,000 cooks to supply food in his alms-halls and 60,000 youths to cut firewood.) He is reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the assembly of the devas who gather to listen to the Buddha's preaching of the Abhidhamma, Ankura occupies a place </data>
<data>in the back row, (12 leagues away says DhA.iii.219; 10 leagues away says Pv.28, v.65) while Indaka, who had given but one spoonful of rice to Anuruddha Thera, sits quite close to the Buddha. The Buddha notices this and remarks that Indaka had been lucky in finding a worthy donee; the recipients of Ankura's gifts had not been distinguished for their holiness. Gifts should, therefore, be given discriminately. At the end of this discourse Ankura becomes a sotápanna. DhA.iii.222; ibid., iv.82.

Some monks in Álaví were begging everywhere for materials and aid to build houses for themselves. People were annoyed by their solicitations and avoided them. When Mahákassapa came to Álaví people ran away from him thinking he too was one of the monks. On enquiry he learnt the reason and told it to the Buddha, who was then at the Aggálava-cetiya. The Buddha rebuked the monks, saying that formerly samanas and recluses, even though offered their choice by kings, never asked for alms, holding that begging from others was neither agreeable nor pleasant. The Manikantha Játaka (J.ii.282ff) was also preached on the same occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It consists of sixteen suttas, all of which are explained in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niddesa')"&gt;Mahá Niddesa&lt;/a&gt;. It may also have been the name of divisions of other books, because we are told that once &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sona')"&gt;Sona Thera&lt;/a&gt; intoned before the Buddha all the verses of the Books of the Eights (Atthaka-vaggikáni). Vin.i.196-7. The DhA. (iv.101-2) says he recited the 16 portions of the Atthakavagga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nandamátá Upásiká was once reciting the Atthakavagga and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/parayana')"&gt;Paráyanavagga&lt;/a&gt; on the roof of her house, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessavana')"&gt;Vessavana&lt;/a&gt;, while on the way with his followers to see the Buddha, listened to her recital (SnA.i.370; but see A.iv.63, where only the Paráyana is mentioned). According to this tradition, the Atthakavagga was already being recited in the Buddha's own time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sanskrit the title was known as Artha-varga and was so understood by the Chinese translators. No one has explained what the title means nor has interpreted the second sutta (Guhatthaka) except as &quot;The eight Verses on the cave,&quot; and similarly with the three following suttas: Dutthatthaka, Suddhattha and Paramatthaka, each of eight verses. The fact that it is commented on separately in the Mahá Niddesa and was translated into Chinese makes it appear probable that it was once a separate work. See Thomas, op. cit., 274.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Atthaka Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Two of the same name. They deal with the methods of mastering the feelings, of bringing about their cessation and of the six ways of calming them. S.iv.221f.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

The Buddha says he can, and proceeds to explain how by concentrating body in mind and mind in body the body becomes radiant and plastic. Like an iron ball heated throughout the day, or a tuft of cotton seed on a ball of thistledown, wafted lightly on the wind, so the body, at such time, rises from the ground into the air and takes on manifold forms of magic power (S.v.282-4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ariyagálatissa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Mahádhanadeva, of Mahágáma. When he was a child he was called Keliyatissa, because he liked to play. Later he joined the Order. Dissatisfied after five years, he gave up his robes and swam down a river. Two women bathing saw him and both claimed him. When they saw he was naked one went to fetch clothes; the other gave him half her garment and took him to her parents and married him. The wife was Sumaná. Because he was found in the river he was called Ganga-tissa; but because he was lazy they called him Nikkammatissa. Sumaná’s people complained of him and sent them away. Tissa sought work under a headman, Candasuriya, a friend of Mahádhanadeva, and reaped and threshed a field of 500 karísas in one day. Candasuriya, marvelling at his strength, gave him all the grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thereafter, Tissa and his wife gave alms daily to eight monks, but as his meals were not tasty, the monks called him Udakalonatissa. Discovering this, he gave them milk rice and was called Khírabhatta-tissa. Later he gave rice mixed with ghee and his name became Kalyánabhatta-tissa. In due course he fed 500 monks daily. One day, while looking for yams in Kumbulapabbata, he discovered 60 treasure troves and took them home. Later he fed many thousands of monks in Cetiyamba-vihára, Anurádhapura and Nágadípa and lived in Ariyagálatittha as a ferryman, taking people across, free of charge. Sakka, wishing to test him, came as an old brahmin and, having tried his patience, filled his house with valuables and gave him a field of rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a discussion arose in Piyangudípa, as to where the most devout people were to be found. Satisambodhi Thera said they were in Ceylon, while Yonakarájaputta Mahábuddharakkhita said they were in Yonakarattha. To test this, Satisambodhi arrived in Tissa's house. His wife, </data>
<data>having fed 12,000 monks, was resting, but having seen the Elder she prepared for him a bowl of catuma-dhura. He asked her to throw the bowl up into the air. It travelled to Piyangudípa, and Sumaná saw the monks as they ate the contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Tissa lay dying, devas brought him chariots from the six deva worlds; he chose to be born in Tusita. His wife, knowing his wishes, retired into her room and died before him. They were both born in Tusita. In a past birth Tissa had been in Chagáma and honoured the Bodhi-tree there.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Andhakavinda&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in the Magadha country, three gávuta from Rájagaha. Between it and Rájagaha is the river Sappiní, which rises in the Gijjhakúta (Vin.i.109; Vin. Texts i.254, n.2). Once the Buddha went from Benares to Andhakavinda with 1,250 monks, and many people followed them carrying cartloads of provisions that they might feed them in turn. There were so many awaiting their turn that a certain brahmin (referred to as Andhakavindabráhmana) had to wait two months for his to come round. At the end of two months, finding that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency he could possibly supply. Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he approached Ananda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha's permission, the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the monks. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke of the tenfold good qualities of milk-rice. Vin.i.220f.; it was this praise uttered by the Buddha that made Visákhá ask him, as a favour, that she should be allowed to supply milk-rice to the monks throughout her life (ibid., 293); see also UdA.112.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the same visit of the Buddha, a newly converted minister of the district prepared meat dishes for the fraternity, but being disappointed that the monks, who had had a meal of solid milk-rice earlier, could not eat large quantities of his dishes, he was rather rude to them. Later he expressed remorse, and the Buddha assured him that heaven would be his inheritance (Vin.i.222f. This was the occasion for the rule that monks who have been invited to a meal in one place should not accept milk-rice somewhere else earlier in the same day.). It was on the way back from </data>
<data>Andhakavinda to Rájagaha that the Buddha met Belattha Kaccána (Vin.i.224f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when the Buddha was staying at Andhakavinda the Brahmá Sahampati came and lighted the place with his effulgent beauty till late at night; then he sought the Buddha and sang before him verses of exhortation meant for the monks, urging them to lead the holy life (S.i.154). Here, too, the Buddha mentioned to Ananda the necessity of admonishing and encouraging new members of the Order with regard to five things: good conduct, control of the faculties of sense, abstinence from too much talking, love of solitude and the cultivation of right views (A.iii.138-9; referred to in Sp.iv.789). Once in Andhakavinda the Buddha suffered from disease of the wind. Ananda was asked to obtain gruel for the complaint. The wife of the village physician supplied the gruel with great devotion, and as a result was born in Távatimsa, where her abode was known as the Kañjikádáyika vimána (VvA.185-6). Another lay devotee built a Gandhakuti for the Buddha at Andhakavinda, and personally looked after the Buddha while he was there. This upásaka was also, as a result, born in Távatimsa in a golden vimána (VvA.302-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cúlasetthi's daughter, Anulá, lived in Andhakavinda after her marriage and it was there that she gave alms on behalf of her dead father (PvA.105-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was one of the ancestors of the Sákiyan race. He belonged to the race of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasammata')"&gt;Mahásammata&lt;/a&gt; and was possessed of four iddhi-powers: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;walking on air, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;being guarded by four devas, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;diffusing the fragrance of sandalwood from his body &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;and the fragrance of the lotus from his mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was prince he had promised to appoint as his family priest his fellow-student Kosakalamba, brother of the royal chaplain &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapila')"&gt;Kapila&lt;/a&gt;, when he should become king. But when Apacara came to the throne, Kapila obtained the post for his own son and became an ascetic. When the king realised what had happened he offered to get the post back for Kosakalamba by means of a lie. The latter protested, because lies had hitherto been unknown in the world; but the king persisted in his desire even in spite of Kapila's warning, and seven times in succession uttered a lie to the effect that the post of chaplain belonged by right of seniority to Kosakambala and not to Kapila's son. At the first lie he lost his iddhi-powers and fell to earth, and with each succeeding lie he fell deeper and deeper into the earth until the flames of Avíci seized him. He was the world's first liar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had five sons, who sought Kapila's protection, and leaving the city founded five cities, which were called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/h')"&gt;Hatthipura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="assapura')"&gt;Assapura&lt;/a&gt;, </data>

During the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, thieves waylaid an anágámí upásaka in this forest; his name was Sorata (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasodhara')"&gt;Yasodhara&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Samyutta Cy), and he had been touring &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')"&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/a&gt; collecting money for the Buddha's cetiya. They gouged out his eyes and killed him. Thereupon the robbers all lost their sight and wandered about the forest blind; hence the name of the forest (&quot;Blind,&quot; usually, but wrongly, translated &quot;Dark&quot;). It had retained its name during two Buddha-periods. The story is given in MA.i.336ff. and SA.i.148.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a Meditation Hall (padhána-ghara) built there for the use of contemplative monks and nuns (MA.i.338). Stories are told of those, particularly the nuns, who were tempted by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara')"&gt;Mára&lt;/a&gt; in the Andhavana. E.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavakaa')"&gt;Álaviká&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somaa')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kisaagotamii')"&gt;Kiságotamí&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vijayaa_theri')"&gt;Vijayá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uppalavannaa')"&gt;Uppalavanná&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caalaa')"&gt;Cálá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upacaalaa')"&gt;Upacálá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sisupacala_theri')"&gt;Sisúpacálá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/selaa')"&gt;Selá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajiraa')"&gt;Vajirá&lt;/a&gt;; J.i.128ff. and ThigA.64, 66, 163.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when &lt;a href="anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; was staying there he </data>
<data>became seriously sick (S.v.302). It was here that the Buddha preached to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raahula')"&gt;Ráhula&lt;/a&gt; the discourse (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_rahulovaada_s')"&gt;Cúla-Ráhulováda&lt;/a&gt;) which made him an arahant (S.iv.105-7; AA.i.145).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among others who lived here from time to time are mentioned the Elders &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khema')"&gt;Khema&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.358), and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; (A.v.9), the last-mentioned experiencing a special kind of samádhi (where he realised that bhavanirodha was nibbána).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragátha Commentary (i.39) records a discussion here between Sáriputta and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punna')"&gt;Punna&lt;/a&gt; regarding purification (visuddhikamma). The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vammiika_sutta')"&gt;Vammiká Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.143ff ) was the result of questions put by an anágami Brahma, his erstwhile colleague, to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaara_kassapa')"&gt;Kumára-kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, while he was in Andhavana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once bandits laid an ambush for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; as he went through the forest to pay his respects to the Buddha, attended by a small escort, as was sometimes his wont. He was warned in time and had the wood surrounded, capturing and impaling or crucifying the bandits on either side of the road through the wood. We are told that though the Buddha knew of this, he did not chide the king because he had certain reasons for not doing so. (See SA.i.131-2. Mrs. Rhys Davids doubts the authenticity of this story; KS.i.127n.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Therí &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uppalavannaa')"&gt;Uppalavanná&lt;/a&gt; was raped in a hut in the forest by a young brahmin named Ananda, and it is said that from that time nuns did not live in Andhavana (DhA.ii.49, 52).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;The Párájiká (Vin.iii.28ff ) contains stories of monks who committed offences in the forest with shepherdesses and others, and also of some monks who ate the flesh of a cow which had been left behind, partly eaten, by cattle thieves (Vin.iii.64). It was here that Uppalavanná obtained the piece of cow's flesh which she asked Udáyi to offer to the Buddha, giving Udáyi her inner robe as &quot;wages&quot; for the job (the story is told in Vin.iii.208-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Párichattakavimána (VvA.172ff ) was the abode which fell to the lot of a woman who having plucked an asoka-flower, while getting firewood in Andhavana, offered it to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule forbidding monks to enter a village clad only in their waist cloth and nether garment was made with reference to a monk whose robe had been stolen by thieves in Andhavana (Vin.i.298).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Andhaká.-Mentioned in a list of tribes that came to pay homage to Jatukannika Thera when he was born as a banker in Hamsavatí (Ap.ii.359). The Andhakarattha was on the banks of the Godhávarí and near where Bávarí lived. Assaka and Alaka, mentioned in the Vatthugáthá of the Paráyanavagga (Sn.977), are described in the Sutta Nipáta Commentary as Andhaka kings. SnA.ii.581; Vincent Smith places them originally in Eastern India between the Krsna and Godávarí rivers (Z.D.M.G. 56, 657ff.); see also Burgess: Arch. Reports on W. India, ii.132 and iii.54. Cunningham: 603-607. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Aitareya Brahmana (vii.18) the Andhakas are mentioned together with the Pulindas, etc., as an outcast tribe. They again appear associated in the time of Asoka (Vincent Smith: Z.D.M.G. 56, 652f). The Mahábhárata (xii.207, 42) places the Pulindas, the Andhas and the Sabaras in the Daksinapatha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Andhaká.-An important group of monks that seceded from the Theraváda. They included as minor sects Pubbaseliyas, Aparaseliyas, Rájagirikas and Siddhatthikas (Points of Controversy, p. 104, extract from Kathávatthu Cy.). They were still powerful in Buddhaghosa's time (Ibid., xxxiv). The Andhakas are not mentioned as a special sect either in the Mahávamsa or in the Dípavamsa, though in the Mahávamsa the sects spoken of above as offshoots of the Andhakas (Rájagiriyá, Siddhatthiká, Pubba- and Apara-seliyá) are given. (Mhv.v.12f.; also the Mbv.97) For a very valuable account of the different schools and their relation to each other, see Points of Controversy, pp. xxxv-xlv. About the Andhakas see particularly pp. xliii.ff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were various doctrines held by all the Andhakas either in common with other sects or alone, and various other </data>

In the course of his wanderings he once travelled with a merchant caravan. The caravan halted for the night, but while the merchants slept, the ascetic spent his time pacing up and down. Robbers, coming to plunder the caravan, were prevented from so doing by the watchfulness of the ascetic. The next day the merchants, discovering what bad happened, asked him if he had felt no fear at the sight of the robbers. &quot;The sight of robbers causes what is known as fear only to the rich. I am penniless, why should I be afraid?&quot; he answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death he was born in the Brahma world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to an upásaka of Sávatthi who had likewise prevented a caravan from being robbed. &quot;In guarding himself a man guards others; in guarding others he guards himself.&quot; J.i.332-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Palandípa was one of its divisions. It once had a king named Víradeva who led an expedition against Jayabáhu I. of Ceylon (Cv.lxi.36f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also the name of a dynasty, the Aryan dynasty of the Pándya (Pandu) in South India.

The Buddha, seeing his upanissaya for sotápatti, passed with the congregation of monks close by the spot where he was fishing and stopped not far from him. Then the Buddha proceeded to ask the monks their names, and noticing that the fisherman himself expected to be questioned, he asked him his. On learning that it was Ariya, the Buddha suggested to him that he was unworthy of the name, because a real Ariya never injured any living thing. At the end of the discourse the fisherman became a sotápanna. DhA.iii.396-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

The name appears in passages where the Buddha's powers are discussed (E.g., BuA.29). &quot;Was not the Buddha honoured even by beasts such as Áravála, etc.?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the conversion of Apalála does not, as far as I can discover, occur in the canonical books. In the Samantapásádiká (iv.742) the story of the conversion of Apalála (Apaláladamana) is given among the stories not included in the Three Councils (sangíti), but that it was known quite early in Ceylon is evidenced by the fact that, among the scenes from the Buddha's life represented in the relic-chamber of the Mahá-Thúpa, the conversion of Apalála is mentioned (Mhv.xxx.84). The Divyávadána (pp.348, 385) makes reference to the story, and states that the nága was converted shortly before the Buddha's death. Hiouen Thsang gives the story in detail (Beal: Records of the Western World i.122; also Legge: Fa Hien's Travels, p.29n.). During Kassapa Buddha's time, Apalála had been a powerful man called Gangi. By means of his charms he subdued the dragons that attacked the country, and the people, in gratitude, agreed to give him tribute. Later some of them forgot their promise and he, in wrath, became a dragon after his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha Gotama visited him and preached to him. He was converted, but, for his sustenance, he was allowed to have one gathering of the crops every twelve years. It is for this reason that the White River (Subhavastu) overflows every twelfth year. The story is found in the Sútrálankára and other Maháyána books. See Nariman: Sanskrit Buddhism, pp.194, 274. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Vinaya of the </data>

He was born in the park Sunanda in Candavatí, his parents being Yasavá and Yasodhará. He lived in three palaces: Siri, Upasiri and Vaddha (Sirivaddha, according to BuA.). His wife was Sirimá and his son Upavána. He renounced household life at the age of 10,000 years, leaving home in a palanquin, and practised austerities for ten months. A maiden, Anupamá, gave him a meal of milk-rice before his Enlightenment, and the ájívaka, Anoma, provided him with grass for his seat, his Bodhi being an ajjuna tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first sermon was preached in the park Sudassana in Subhavatí. The Twin-Miracle was performed at Osadhí at the foot of an asana tree. Nisabha and Asoka (v.l. Anoma) were chief among his monks, and Sundarí and Sumaná among his nuns. Among laymen, Nandivaddha and Sirivaddha were his foremost supporters, and among laywomen, Uppalá and Padumá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Dhammaka was his royal patron; his constant attendant was Varuna. He lived to be 100,000 years old and died at Dhammáráma. He held three assemblies at which were present 800,000, 700,000 and 600,000 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was a powerful yakkha-chief and entertained the Buddha and his following (Bu.x.; BuA.141-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a sermon preached by Nisabha and Anoma, the chief disciples of this Buddha, that made Sarada-tápasa (Sáriputta in his last birth) wish to become an aggasávaka himself. Later, Sirivaddha (Moggallána), at Sarada's suggestion, entertained the Buddha and wished for the post of second disciple under Gotama (DhA.i.88-94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakkula Thera was an ascetic in Anomadassí's day. The Buddha once suffered from an abdominal affliction and it was this ascetic who cured him(AA.i.169; Mil.216).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;It is said that at Anomadassí's birth seven kinds of jewels rained down from the sky and that this was the reason for his name. From the time of his conception the aura of his body spread round him to a distance of eighty hands. BuA.141.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

Anomadassí.-A Sangharája of Ceylon, at whose request the Hatthavanagalla-Vihára-Vamsa was written (D'Alwis' edition, p.7, n.6). He was the author of a Sinhalese work on astrology, the Daivajña-káma-dhenu, and he is generally identified with the Elder for whom, according to the Cúlavamsa (lxxxviii. vv.37-9; see also P.L.C., 219), Patirájadeva, minister to Parakkamabáhu II., built in Hatthavanaggalla, following the king's orders, a temple of three storeys and a lofty pinnacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Angulimála (Angulimálaka)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robber who was converted by the Buddha in the twentieth year of his ministry, and who, later, became an arahant. His story appears both in the Majjhima Cy., 743ff., and in the Thag. Cy., ii.57ff. The two accounts differ in certain details; I have summarised the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of the brahmin&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaggava')"&gt;Bhaggava&lt;/a&gt;, chaplain to the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;, his mother being&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mantaanii')"&gt;Mantání&lt;/a&gt;. He was born under the thieves' constellation, and on the night of his birth all the armour in the town shone, including that belonging to the king. Because this omen did no harm to anyone the babe was named Ahimsaka. The Thag. Cy. says he was first called Himsaka and then Ahimsaka. See also Ps. of the Brethren, 323, n.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt; he became a favourite at the teacher's house, but his jealous fellow-students poisoned his teacher's mind, and the latter, bent on his destruction, asked as his honorarium a thousand human right-hand fingers. Thereupon Ahimsaka waylaid travellers in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaalinii')"&gt;Jáliní&lt;/a&gt; forest in Kosala and killed them, taking a finger from each. The finger-bones thus obtained he made into a garland to hang round his neck, hence the name Angulimála.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of his deeds whole villages were deserted, and the king ordered a detachment of men to seize the bandit, whose name nobody knew. But Angulimála's mother, guessing the truth, started off to warn him. By now he lacked but one finger to complete his thousand, and seeing his mother coming he determined to kill her. But the Buddha, seeing his upanissaya, went himself to the wood, travelling thirty yojanas, (DA.i.240; </data>
<data>J.iv.180) and intercepted Angulimála on his way to slay his mother. Angulimála was converted by the Buddha's power and received the &quot;ehi bhikkhu pabbajjá&quot; (Thag.868-70) while the populace were yelling at the king's palace for the robber's life. Later, the Buddha presented him before King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; when the latter came to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, and Pasenadi, filled with wonder, offered to provide the monk with all requisites. Angulimála, however, had taken on the dhutangas and refused the king's offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he entered &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; for alms, he was attacked by the mob, but on the admonition of the Buddha, endured their wrath as penance for his former misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapadatthakatha (iii.169) he appears to have died soon after he joined the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a story of how be eased a woman's labour pains by an act of truth. The words he used in this saccakiriyá (yato aham sabbaññutabuddhassa ariyassa ariyáya játiyá játo) have come to be regarded as a paritta to ward off all dangers and constitute the Angulimála Paritta. The water that washed the stone on which he sat in the woman's house came to be regarded as a panacea (M.ii.103-4; MA.747f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Angulimála Sutta he is addressed by Pasenádi as Gagga Mantáníputta, his father being a Gagga. The story is evidently a popular one and occurs also in the Avadána Sataka (No.27).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Kosala king's &lt;a href="asadisadaana')"&gt;Asadisadána&lt;/a&gt;, an untamed elephant, none other being available, was used to bear the parasol over Angulimála. The elephant remained perfectly still - such was Angulimála's power (DhA.iii.185; also DA.ii.654).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversion of Angulimála is often </data>
<data>referred to as a most compassionate and wonderful act of the Buddha's, e.g. in the Sutasoma Játaka, (J.v.456f.; see also J.iv.180; SnA.ii.440; DhA.i.124) which was preached concerning him. The story of Angulimála is quoted as that of a man in whose case a beneficent kamma arose and destroyed former evil kamma (AA.i.369).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on his account that the rule not to ordain a captured robber was enacted (Vin.i.74).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his identification with Kalmásapáda see J.P.T.S., 1909, pp. 240ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

From&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya')"&gt;Bhaddiya&lt;/a&gt; (in Anga), (DhA.i.384) the Buddha went to &lt;a href="anguttaraapa')"&gt;Anguttárapa&lt;/a&gt; and thence to Ápana (Vin.i.243-5; DhA.iii.363).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country was probably rich because we find as many as 1,250 monks accompanying the Buddha on his tour (Sn.102f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other suttas preached here are the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/potaliya')"&gt;Potaliya&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.359), and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/latukikopama_s')"&gt;Latukikopama&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.447). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apana seems to have been the chief township, because it is always mentioned in connection with Anguttarápa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, while testing a sword, he sneezed and cut off the tip of his nose. The king had a false tip made and fastened to his nose so that no one could tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king had a daughter and an adopted nephew, who, when they grew up, fell deeply in love with each other. They wished to marry, but the king, having other plans, kept them apart. The prince bribed an old woman to get his beloved for him. The old woman reported to the king that his daughter was under the influence of witchcraft and that the only way of curing her was to take her to the cemetery under armed escort, where she must be laid on a bed under which was a corpse, and there she must be bathed for the purpose of exorcism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prince was to impersonate the corpse, being provided with pepper in order that he might sneeze at the right moment; the guard were warned that if the exorcism succeeded, the dead body would sneeze, rise up and kill the first thing it could lay hold of. The plot succeeded, the guard taking to their heels when the prince sneezed. The two lovers were married and were forgiven by the king. Later, they became king and queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day the sword-testing brahmin was standing in the sun when the false tip of his nose melted and fell off. He stood hanging his head for very shame. &quot;Never mind,&quot; laughed the king, &quot;sneezing is bad for some, but good for others. A sneeze lost you your nose, but a sneeze won for me both my throne and my queen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a brahmin of the kingdom of Kosala who tested swords by smelling them. He accepted </data>
<data>bribes and passed the swords only of those who had won his favour. One day an exasperated dealer put pepper on his sword so that when the brahmin smelt it he sneezed, slitting his nose. The monks were once talking about him when the Buddha entered and told them the story of the past. The two brahmins were one and the same man in different births.

Arunavatí.-The city and the country of King Arunavá, and the birthplace of Sikhí Buddha (Bu.xxi.15). It was from there that Sikhí and Abhibhú went to the Brahma-world to preach to Brahma and his attendants (S.i.155f). At that time Salalapupphiya Thera was a confectioner in Arunavatí (Ap.i.218).

Soon afterwards he became an arahant (AA.i.21-2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is said to have been preached by the Buddha on the fullmoon day of Jetthamása (AA.i.436).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Nágasena's teacher sent him to Assagutta to spend the rainy season with him. There was an old woman, a devout follower of the Faith, who had for thirty years or more looked after Assagutta; it was while preaching to her that Nágasena became a Sotápanna. She, too, became a sotápanna (Mil.16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Nágasena had completed his course, Assagutta sent him on to Pátaliputta to Dhammarakkhita. It was Assagutta who interceded with Sakka to persuade Mahásena to leave the deva-world and be born in the world of men as Nagasena. He was evidently the leader of the Sangha at the time, for it was he who summoned an assembly at Yugandhara to discuss the danger caused by Milinda's controversies (Mil.6).

Finding that his presence in the city was causing anxiety to the latter, he left Benares and entered into the service of another king, as archer. He attained great fame by his wonderful feats of archery. Once he brought down a mango with the downward shot of an arrow, which, in its upward flight, reached the realm of the Cátummahárájiká, whence it was turned back by another arrow, which, having accomplished its purpose, rose to Tavatimsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, on hearing that seven kings had beleaguered his brother's kingdom, Asadisa shot an arrow, bearing a message, into the dish from which the kings were eating, and they all fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He soon afterwards became an ascetic and at his death was born in the Brahma world.

He once visited the Buddha at Jetavana and asked if one could, by travelling, reach the end of the world where there would be no birth, old age, death, etc. The Buddha said that such was not possible. The devaputta then confessed that he had, in a previous life, been a sage called Rohitassa, a Bhojaputta of great psychic powers, able in one stride to cross from the western ocean to the eastern. The Commentary (SA.i.92) adds that he would wash in the Anotatta Lake and go to eat in Uttarakuru. With such a stride, he had travelled for one hundred years, and yet failed to reach the world's end, where there was no birth, old age, death, etc. That was true, agreed the Buddha; in this fathom long body is the world, its origin, its making and end, likewise the practice which leads to such end. S.i.61f.; repeated at A.ii.47f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Rohitassa.&lt;/b&gt; A sage, described as Bhojaputta. See Rohitassa (I).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

On the death of his father Renu, with the advice and co operation of his chief steward (Mahágovinda) &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jotipaala')"&gt;Jotipála&lt;/a&gt;, who was also his great friend, divided his kingdom into seven parts and shared it with his friends -  Sattabhu, Brahmadatta, Vessabhu, Bharata, and the two Dhataratthas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven divisions of the kingdom were called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalinga')"&gt;Kalinga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assaka')"&gt;Assaka&lt;/a&gt;, Avanti, Sovíra, Videha, Anga and Kási; their capitals were, respectively, Dantapura, Potana, Máhissatí, Roruka, Mithilá, Campá and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Báránasí&lt;/a&gt;. Renu himself occupied the central kingdom. A ii.228 36; Renu probably reigned in  Benares, though the account given in the Mahágovinda Sutta does not make it clear which was his kingdom; see Dial.ii.270 n.; also Mtu.iii.197 209; and Renu (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Renu. &lt;/b&gt;Son of Disampati, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; (Dpv.iii.40; MT. 130). He is probably identical with Renu (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

Aggabodhi II. built for it the Unnalomaghara vihárá (C.xlii.62). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cetiya was perhaps erected in honour of the Rájáyatana tree, which was brought by Samiddhisumana from Jetavana when he came with the Buddha to Ceylon (See Mhv.i.52, 57f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DA.iii.899) that when the Buddha's religion disappears, all the relics of the Buddha in Ceylon will gather together at the Mahácetiya, proceed from there to the Rájáyatana cetiya in Nágadípa, and from there, finally, to the Bodhi tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rathaviníta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twenty fourth sutta of the Majjhima Nikáya. Sáriputta visits Punna Mantániputta in Andhavana and asks him why he lives the higher life. To attain absolute Nibbána, answers Punna, and, on being questioned further as to the nature of Nibbána, he explains that Nibbána is the goal and can only be attained by passing through various successive stages   purity of life, purity of heart, purity of view, purity through dispelling doubts, purity through full insight into paths, right and wrong, into the path to be followed, and the purity which arises from insight. It may be compared to a journey of Pasenadi from Sávatthi to Sáketa, by means of relays of seven carriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said in the introduction to the sutta that Sáriputta had been awaiting the opportunity of a discussion with Punna ever since he heard the monks at Veluvana in Rájagaha speak of him to the Buddha in terms of the highest praise. But this opportunity did not arise until later, when Punna visited Sávatthi. Punna was unaware of the identity of Sáriputta until the end of his discourse (M.i.145 51).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávamsa Tíká mentions (MT.552f ) that once Ambapásánavásí Cittagutta preached this sutta to a very large assembly of monks and nuns at the Lohapásáda in Anurádhapura, and in his exposition of the sutta included a short account of the relies enshrined in the Mahá Thúpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested by Dr. Neumann that the upatisapasina mentioned in Asoka's Bhabru Edict, refers to this sutta. But see Rhys Davids, J.R.A.S.1893, and Mukherji, Asoka, 118f., n.8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rájakáráma&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Sávatthi, near Jetavana, built by Pasenadi (J.ii.15). It was to the south east of the city, corresponding to Thúpáráma in Anurádhapura. (MA.ii.1021). It was there that the Nandakováda Sutta was preached (M.iii.271). This was probably the monastery built for nuns by Pasenadi, at the Buddha's suggestion, after the assault on Uppalavanná in Andhavana, referred to in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.52). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Commentary, however, gives a different account (SA.iii.218f.; the introductory story of the Bharu Játaka; J.ii.170, gives the same account but omits the statement that the king built a vihára). It states that the heretics, jealous of the Buddha and his popularity, desired to build a monastery for themselves in close proximity to Jetavana, and, in order that he might raise no objections, they presented Pasenadi with one hundred thousand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha discovered their intentions, owing to the great uproar they made while preparing the preliminaries of the building, he sent Ananda to the king, asking to have it stopped. But Pasenadi refused to see him or Sáriputta or Moggallána. (It was as a punishment for this discourtesy that he lost the throne before his death.) Thereupon the Buddha went himself. Pasenadi received him and entertained him to a meal, at the end of which the Buddha preached to him the Bharu Játaka (q.v.) on the evils of bribery and of creating an opportunity for virtuous people to quarrel among themselves. Pasenadi was filled with remorse; he had the heretics expelled, and, realizing that he had never built a monastery, proceeded to construct the Rájakárama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya (S.v.360ff ) contains several sermons preached by the Buddha at the Rájakáráma.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

All those who saw him or heard of him developed a fever (jararoga) accompanied by redness of the eyes and died of the disease, the Yakkha devouring their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king heard of this, and, by the power of his goodness, compelled the Yakkha to come to him, and persuaded him to abandon his evil influence. In return, the king promised to have offerings (bali) placed for the Yakkha at the entrance to every village. Mhv.xxxvi.82ff.; Attanagaluvamsa, p.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the Buddha and Ananda visited Kusinárá, the Malla chieftains decreed that whoever failed to pay homage to the Buddha would be fined five hundred coins. Roja was Ananda's friend, and Ananda was pleased when he arrived to pay homage to the Buddha, but when Roja said that he did so only out of regard for his kinsmen's decree, Ananda was bitterly disappointed and asked the Buddha to discover some means by which Roja could be made to become his follower. The Buddha agreed to do this, and by means of the power of his compassion, Roja was induced to visit him again. The Buddha preached to Roja, who asked, as a boon, that the monks should accept hospitality only from him. This request was refused by the Buddha, who said that Roja must take his turn with others in showing hospitality to him and his monks. Finding that he had long to wait for his turn, Roja made enquiries, and, discovering that the monks had no supply of green vegetables (dáka) or pastry (pittakhádaniya), he consulted Ananda, and, with the Buddha's sanction, offered these things to the Buddha and his monks (Vin.i.247ff). It is said (J.ii.231f) that Roja once invited Ananda to his house, and, after entertaining him lavishly, tried to induce him to leave the Order by offering him half his wealth. But Ananda refused this offer, explaining to him the miseries involved in household life. Later, Ananda repeated this conversation to the Buddha, who related the Vacchanakha Játaka (q.v.) to show that Roja and Ananda had been friends in a past life too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Roja forced on Ananda a linen cloth (khomapilotiká); Ananda had need of it, and accepted it with the Buddha's permission (Vin.i.296).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

It is said that at the age of eleven he was distinguished for his bravery. He gained the throne by defeating the Portuguese. His capital was at Sítávaka.

The Buddha gave him no answer, and, at the conclusion of the meal, left the palace. Ráhula followed him, reiterating his request until at last the Buddha asked Sáriputta to ordain him. (According to SNA.i.340, Moggallána taught him the kammavácá; see also J.ii.393). When Suddhodana heard of this he protested to the Buddha, and asked as a boon that, in future, no child should be ordained without the consent of his parents, and to this the Buddha agreed (Vin.i.82f.; the story of Ráhula's conversion is also given at DhA.i.98f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (AA.i.145) that immediately after Ráhula's ordination the Buddha preached to him constantly (abhinhovádavasena) many suttas for his guidance. Ráhula himself was eager to receive instruction from the Buddha and his teachers and would rise early in the morning and take a handful of sand, saying: &quot;May I have today as many words of counsel from my teachers as there are here grains of sand!&quot; The monks constantly spoke of Ráhula's amenability, and one day the Buddha, aware of the subject of their talk, went amongst them and related the Tipallatthamiga Játaka (J.i.160ff ) and the Tittira Játaka (J.iii.64ff ) to show them that in past births, too, Ráhula had been known for his obedience. When Ráhula was seven years old, the Buddha preached to him the Ambalatthika Ráhulováda Sutta (q.v.) as a warning that he should never lie, even in fun. </data>
<data>Ráhula used to accompany the Buddha on his begging rounds. Sometimes he would accompany Sáriputta on his begging rounds. He was present when Sáriputta went to his (Sáriputta's) mother's house, where he was roundly abused by her for having left her. DhA.iv.164f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ráhula noticed that he harboured carnal thoughts fascinated by his own physical beauty and that of his father, the Buddha preached to him, at the age of eighteen, the Mahá Ráhulováda Sutta (q.v.). Two other suttas, also called Ráhulováda, one included in the Samyutta and the other in the Anguttara (see below), formed the topics for Ráhula's meditation (Vipassaná). To these Suttas Buddhaghosa (MA.i.635) adds the Sámanera, or Kumárapañhá, and proceeds to enumerate the different purposes which the Buddha had in view in preaching these suttas; see also AA.ii.547. SNA.i.340 says, about the Ráhula Sutta (q.v.), that the Buddha constantly preached it to Ráhula. See also the Ráhula Samyutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the Buddha, knowing that Ráhula's mind was ripe for final attainment, went with him alone to Andhavana, and preached to him the Cúla Ráhulováda Sutta. At the end of the discourse, Ráhula became an arahant, together with one hundred thousand crores of listening devas. SA.iii.26 says these devas were among those who, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, had heard Ráhula's wish to be born as the son of a future Buddha. They were subsequently born in various deva worlds, but on this day they all assembled at Andhavana in order to be present at the fulfilment of Ráhula’s wish. This scene was one of the incidents sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahá Thúpa, as was also the ordination of Ráhula. Mhv.xxxi.81, 83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, in the assembly of monks, the Buddha declared Ráhula foremost among those of his disciples who were anxious for training (sikkhákámánam). </data>
<data>A.i.24; the Vinaya (iii.16) gives a story illustrating Ráhula's extreme conscientiousness in the observance of rules. He arrived one evening at Kosambí, when the Buddha was staying there in the Badarikáráma. Ráhula was told there of a new rule which had been laid down to the effect that no novice should sleep under the same roof as a fully ordained monk. Unable to find any resting place which did not violate this rule, Ráhula spent the night in the Buddha's jakes. When the Buddha discovered him there the next morning, he modified the rule. This incident and Ráhula's keenness in observing rules are described again in greater detail at J.i.161f. There the Buddha is said to have found fault with Sáriputta for his neglect of Ráhula (see also Sp.iv.744). On another occasion, finding no place in which to sleep because monks who had arrived late had taken his sleeping place, Ráhula spent the night in the open, in front of the Buddha's cell. Mára, seeing him there, assumed the form of a huge elephant and trumpeted loudly, hoping to frighten him. But the plot failed. This was eight years after Ráhula had attained arahantship (DhA.iv.69f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, both Ráhula and Ratthapála were rich householders of Hamsavatí, who, realizing the vanity of riches, gave all away to the poor. One day they entertained two ascetics of great power. The ascetic to whom Ráhula ministered was in the habit of visiting the abode of the Nága king, Pathavindhara, and had been impressed by its magnificence. Therefore, in returning thanks to Ráhula for his hospitality, he wished that his host might resemble Pathavindhara. Ráhula remembered this, and after death he was born in the Nága world as Pathavindhara, his friend being born as Sakka. He was, however, dissatisfied with his lot, and one day when, with Virúpakkha, he was on a visit to Sakka, Sakka recognized him, and finding out that he was </data>
<data>dissatisfied, suggested to him a remedy. Pathavindhara invited the Buddha to his abode. The Buddha, attended by Sumana and one hundred thousand arahants, came and was entertained by him. In the company of monks was Uparevata, the Buddha's son, seated next to him, and Pathavindhara was so fascinated by him that he could not take his eyes off him. Discovering who he was, Pathavindhara expressed a wish that he, too, might be born as the son of a future Buddha. Later, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, Ráhula was born as Pathavindhara, the eldest son of King Kiki, later becoming his viceroy. His seven sisters built seven residences for the Buddha, and, at their suggestion, Pathavindhara built five hundred residences for the monks. The story of the past as given here is taken from AA.i.141ff.; part of it is given in MA.ii.722 under Ratthapála, but the account differs in details. There the Nága world is called Bhumindhara, and the Nága king, Pálita. SNA.i.341 differs again and calls the king Sankha. See also ThagA.ii.30 on Ratthapála, where no mention is made of Ráhula. The Apadána (i. 60f.) gives a different version altogether. There Ráhula gave Padumuttara Buddha a carpet (santhara), as a result of which, twenty one kappas ago, he was born as a khattiya named Vimala, in Renuvatí. There he lived in a palace, Sudassana, specially built for him by Vissakamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four verses uttered by Ráhula are included in the Theragáthá (vs.295 98; Mil.413 contains several other stanzas attributed to Ráhula).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the news of Ráhula’s birth was brought to the Bodhisatta when he was enjoying himself in his pleasances on the banks of the royal pond after being decked by Vissakamma. As soon as the news was announced, he made up his mind to renounce the world without delay, for he saw, in the birth of a son, a new bond attaching him to household life (&quot;Ráhulajáto, bandhanam játam&quot;   </data>
<data>the word ráhula meaning bond). J.i.60; DhA.i.70. The Ap. Commentary, however, derives Ráhula from Ráhu; just as Ráhu obstructs the moon, so would the child be as obstruction to the Bodhisatta's Renunciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dígha and Samyutta Commentaries (DA.ii.549; SA.iii.172), Ráhula predeceased the Buddha and even Sáriputta, and the place of his death is given as Távatimsa. For twelve years he never lay on a bed. (DA.iii.736).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In numerous Játakas, Ráhula is mentioned as having been the Bodhisatta's son -  e.g., in the Uraga, Kapi (No. 250), Kumbhakára, Khandahála, Culla Sutasoma, Daddara, Bandhanágára, Makkata, Makhadeva, Mahájanaka, Mahásudassana, Vidhurapandita, Vessantara, Síhakotthuka and Sonaka. He was also Yaññadatta, son of Mandavya (Sáriputta) and the young tortoise in the Maháukkusa. The Apadána (ii.551) says that in many births Uppalavanná and Ráhula were born of the same parents (ekasmim sambhave) and had similar tendencies (samánacchandamánasá).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ráhula was known to his friends as Ráhulabhadda (Ráhula, the Lucky). He himself says (Thag. vs. 295f ) that he deserved the title because he was twice blest in being the son of the Buddha and an arahant himself. Mention is often made in the books (DhA.i.124; MA.i.537; Mil.410 attributes this statement to Sáriputta; SNA.i.202 expands it to include others) that, though Ráhula was his own son, the Buddha showed as much love for Devadatta, Angulimála and Dhanapála as he did for Ráhula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asoka built a thúpa in honour of Ráhula, to be specially worshipped by novices.

These monks later became the founders of the Síhalasangha in Burma. Later, at one of the festivals of King Narapati, Ráhula fell in love with an actress and went with her to </data>

It consists of a series of lessons given by the Buddha to Ráhula, showing him the fleeting nature of all things (S.ii.244 56). Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.635f ) that these suttas were preached on various occasions, from the time Ráhula entered the Order, to the time of his attainment of arahantship. They contain mention of qualities which mature emancipation, vimuttiparipácaníyadhammá (SA.ii.159).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Ráhula Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha tells Ráhula that a monk should cultivate the thought that, in the four elements, either in one's own body or in external objects, there is neither self nor what pertains to the self. A.ii.164; this same topic is discussed in greater detail in the Ambalatthika Ráhulováda Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.547) that the Buddha here declares catukotikasuññatá (emptiness in the four things   i.e., elements).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Ráhula Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ráhula visits the Buddha and asks him how to get rid of the insidious idea of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine,&quot; both with regard to one's own body and with all external objects. The Buddha replies that one should see things as they really are, that in none of the five khandhas is there any &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine.&quot; This is right insight. S.iii.135; this sutta is given at S.ii.252 as Anusaya Sutta. Buddhaghosa describes both this sutta and the next as Ráhulováda vipassaná (AA.ii.547).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3.

Ráhula Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of stanzas which, according to Buddhaghosa (SNA.i.340), were frequently recited by the Buddha for the guidance of Ráhula. The Buddha reminds him that he (Ráhula) is a follower of &quot;the torch bearer among men.&quot; He has left the world to put an end to sorrow. He should, therefore, associate with good friends, in good surroundings. He should be free from attachment to food or clothes. He should free his mind from all evil tendencies and fill it with thoughts of renunciation. SN. vv. 335 42. Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.532, 635) that the purpose of this sutta was to emphasize the value of good association (kalyánamittúpanissaya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Rájováda Játaka (No. 151)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two kings, Brahmadatta of Benares (the Bodhisatta) and Mallika of Kosala, while journeying in disguise, in order to discover if anyone in their respective kingdoms could tell them of any faults which they (the kings) possessed, meet in a narrow path, and a dispute arises among the charioteers as to who should give place. It is discovered that both are of the same age and power. Each driver sings the praises of his own master, but then they discover that Mallika is good to the good and bad to the bad, while Brahmadatta is good to both the good and the bad. Mallika's charioteer acknowledges Brahmadatta as the superior and gives place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is related to Pasenadi, who comes to the Buddha after having had to decide a difficult case involving moral turpitude. He is satisfied that he has done well, and the Buddha agrees with him that to administer justice with impartiality is the way to heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallika is identified with Ananda and his driver with Moggallána, while Brahmadatta's driver is Sáriputta.

The ascetic gave him ripe figs, and, when asked why they were so sweet, explained that the king of the country was evidently a just ruler. The king returned to his kingdom and ruled for a while unjustly; and returning again to the hermitage, he found that the figs had become bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Pasenadi, in order to show the importance of a king ruling wisely and justly.

Rádha Játaka (No. 145)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as a parrot, named Potthapáda, and his brother was Rádha. They were brought up by a brahmin of Kásí. When the brahmin was away, his wife admitted men to the house and her husband set the birds to watch. Rádha wished to admonish her, but his brother said it was useless and they must await the brahmin's return. Having told him what had happened, the two parrots flew away, saying they could not live there any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rádha is identified with Ananda (J.i.495f).

But Potthapáda, in spite of his brother's warning, admonished the woman, who, in a rage, while pretending to fondle him, wrung his neck and threw him into the fire. When the brahmin returned, Rádha said he did not wish to share his brother's fate, and flew away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potthapáda is identified with Ananda.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ratthapála &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Ratthapála Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief of those who had left the world through faith (saddhápabbajitánam) (A.i.24). He was born at Thullakotthita in the Kuru country as the son of a very wealthy councillor and was called by his family name of Ratthapála. Given to the family because it retrieved the fortunes of a disrupted kingdom, says the Commentary. He lived in great luxury, and, in due course, married a suitable wife. When the Buddha visited Thullakotthita, Ratthapála went to hear him preach and decided to leave the world. His parents would not, however, give their consent till he threatened to starve himself to death. Realizing then that he was in earnest, they agreed to let him go on condition that he would visit them after his ordination. Ratthapála accompanied the Buddha to Sávatthi, and there, dwelling alone, he attained arahantship within a short time (But MA.ii.725 says he took twelve years, during which time he never slept on a bed, DA.iii.236). Then, with the Buddha's permission, he returned to Thullakotthita and dwelt in the deer park of the Kuru king. The day after his arrival, while begging for alms, he came to his father's house. His father was in the entrance hall having his hair combed, but, failing to recognize his son, he started to abuse him, taking him for an ordinary monk, one of those who had robbed him of his son. Just at that moment the slave girl of the house was about to throw away some stale rice, which Ratthapála begged of her. The girl recognized his voice, gave him the rice and told his parents who he was. When his father came to look for his son, he found him eating stale rice as though it were ambrosia. (This eating of stale rice made of him an aggaariyavamsika, Sp.i.208; MA.ii.726). Having already finished eating, when invited to enter the house, he would not do so, </data>
<data>but on the next day he went again, and his father tried to tempt him by making a display of the immense wealth which would be his should he return to the lay life, while his former wives, beautifully clothed, asked him about the nymphs, for whose sake he led the homeless life. &quot;For the sake of no nymphs, Sisters,&quot; he said, and they fell fainting under the shock of being addressed as &quot;Sisters.&quot; Growing impatient at the conduct of his family, he asked for his meal, ate it, preached to them (Buddhaghosa says that according to the Commentators of India, parasamuddavásítheránám, he preached standing; the stanzas so preached are given in M.i.64f. and again in Thag.769-75) on the impermanence of all things, the futility of wealth, the snare of beauty, etc., and returned to Migácíra. Through the air, says the Commentary (ThagA.ii.34; MA.ii.730), because his father put bolts on the house and tried to keep him there. He also sent men to remove his yellow robes and clothe him in white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There the Kuru king, who was feasting there, and had often heard of Ratthapála's fame, visited him. Their conversation is recorded in the Ratthapála Sutta. Ratthapála then returned to the Buddha. Ratthapála's story is given in M.ii.54ff.; MA.ii.722; ThagA.ii.30ff.; AA.i.144ff., cp. Avadas. ii.118ff.; Mtu.iii.41, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous birth, before the appearance of Padumuttara Buddha, Ratthapála was one of two rich householders of Hamsavatí, both of whom spent their wealth in good deeds. They once waited on two companies of ascetics from Himavá; the ascetics left, but their leaders remained, and the two householders looked after them till they died. After death, one of them (Ratthapála) was reborn as Sakka, while the other was born as the Nága king Pálita (v.l. Pathavindhara), who, in this Buddha age, became Ráhula. At Sakka's request, Pálita gave alms to </data>
<data>Padumuttara and wished to be like the Buddha's son, Uparevata. Sakka himself entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days and wished to resemble the monk Ratthapála, whom Padumuttara Buddha had declared to be foremost among those who had joined the Order through faith. Padumuttara declared that the wish of both would be fulfilled in the time of Gotama Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MA.ii.722; ThagA.ii.30 differs in many details; it makes no mention of Pálita, and says that in Padumuttara's time, too, the householder's name was Ratthapála. The name of the monk, disciple of Padumuttara, whose example incited the householder to wish for similar honour, is not given. This account adds (see also AA.i.143f.) that in the time of Phussa Buddha (q.v.) he was one of those in charge of the almsgiving held in the Buddha's honour by his three step brothers. Bimbisára and Visákha were his colleagues (AA.i.165). The Ap.i.63f is again different. It says that in Padumuttara's time the householder gave the Buddha an elephant with all its trappings, and then, buying it back, built with the money a sanghá-ráma containing fifty four thousand rooms. As a result he was king of the gods fifty times and Cakkavatti fifty eight times. AA.i.141 gives the story at greater length, some of the minor details varying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratthapála is mentioned (E.g., SNA.i.232; at AA.ii.596 Yasa's name is added ) with Sona-setthiputta as one who enjoyed great luxury as a householder. He is an example (DA.ii.642; SA.iii.201; VibhA.306; DhA.iv.195) of one who attained to the higher knowledge through resolution (chandam dhuram katvá). The Vinayapitaka (Vin.iii.148; Ratthapála is here called a kulaputta. The incident probably refers to his lay life) contains a stanza quoted by the Buddha, in which Ratthapála's father enquires of his son why the latter never asked him for anything. &quot;Because begging is a degrading thing,&quot; says Ratthapála.&lt;/p&gt;</data>

It contains an account of Ratthapála's admission into the Order, his visits to his parents after attaining arahantship, and his conversation with the Kuru king in the latter's Deer Park. This last conversation forms the chief theme. The king asks Ratthapála why he has left his home when he suffers neither from old age, failing health, poverty, nor death of kinsfolk. Ratthapála answers that his reason for leaving it was his conviction of the truth of the four propositions enunciated by the Buddha   that the world (1) is in a state of continual flux and change; (2) there is no protector or preserver; (3) in it, we own nothing, but must leave all behind us; (4) it lacks and bankers, being enslaved by craving. These four propositions are referred to as Cattáro dhammuddesá (MA.i.361).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explains the meaning of these statements to the satisfaction of the king and summarizes his statements in a series of stanzas. M.ii.54 74. The stanzas included in the sutta are found in Thag.769 75 (those preached to Ratthapála's father), and 776 93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ratthapála, Sutta (VibhA.267; MA.i.225; what this means is not quite clear; this sutta makes no mention of kammatthána; another sutta of the same name is probably meant.) is mentioned as an example of a discourse in which the </data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ráhulamátá&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; The name, generally given in the texts, of &lt;a href="raahula')"&gt;Ráhula's&lt;/a&gt; mother (E.g., Vin.i.82) and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama's&lt;/a&gt; wife.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is also called Bhaddakaccá,* and, in later texts, Yasodhará (BuA., p.245; Dvy.253), Bimbádeví (J.ii.392f.; DA.ii.422) and, probably, Bimbásundarí (J.vi.478 [12]).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* E.g., Bu.xxvi.15; Mhv.ii.24 calls her Bhaddakaccáná; but see Thomas, op.   cit., 49; she is also called Subhaddaká, this being probably a variant of   Bhaddakaccáná.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Northern texts seem to favour the name of Yasodhará, but they call her the daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandapaanii')"&gt;Dandapání&lt;/a&gt;. (See also Rockhill, op. cit., where various other names are given as well). It is probable that the name of Gotama's wife was Bimbá, and that Bhaddakaccá, Subhaddaká, Yosadhári and the others, were descriptive epithets applied to her, which later became regarded as, additional names. It is also possible that in Gotama's court there was also a Yasodhará, daughter of Dandapání, and that there was a later confusion of names. The Commentarial explanation (E.g., AA.i.204), that she was called Bhaddakaccáná because her body was the colour of burnished gold, is probably correct. To suggest (E.g., Thomas, op. cit., 49) that the name bears any reference to the Kaccánagotta seems to be wrong, because the Kaccána was a brahmin gotta and the Sákiyans were not brahmins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ráhulamátá was born on the same day as the Bodhisatta (J.i.54; BuA. 106, 228). She married him (Gotama) at the age of sixteen (the following account is taken chiefly from J.i.58ff), and was placed at the head of forty thousand women, given to Gotama by the Sákiyans, after he had proved his manly prowess to </data>
<data>their satisfaction. Gotama left the household life on the day of the birth of his son Ráhula (according to one account, referred to in the Játaka Commentary, i.62, Ráhula was seven days old). It is said that just before he left home he took a last look at his wife from the door of her room, not daring to go nearer, lest he should awake her. When the Buddha paid his first visit to Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment, and on the second day of that visit, he begged in the street for alms. This news spread, and Ráhulamátá looked out of her window to see if it were true. She saw the Buddha, and was so struck by the glory of his personality that she uttered eight verses in its praise. These verses have been handed down under the name of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/narasihagata')"&gt;Narasíhagáthá&lt;/a&gt;; on that day, after the Buddha had finished his meal in the palace, which he took at the invitation of Suddhodana, all the ladies of the court, with the exception of Ráhulamátá, went to pay him obeisance. She refused to go, saying that if she had any virtue in her the Buddha would come to her. The Buddha went to her with his two chief Disciples and gave orders that she should be allowed to greet him as she wished. She fell at his feet, and clasping them with her hands, put her head on them. Suddhodana related to the Buddha how, from the time he had left home, Ráhulamátá had herself abandoned all luxury and had lived in the same manner as she had heard that the Buddha lived -  wearing yellow robes, eating only once a day, etc. And the Buddha then related the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candakinnara_jat_485')"&gt;Candakinnara Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, to show how, in the past, too, her loyalty had been supreme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the seventh day of the Buddha's visit, when he left the palace at the end of his meal, Ráhulamátá sent Ráhula to him saying, &quot;That is your father, go and </data>
<data>ask him for your inheritance.&quot; Ráhula followed the Buddha, and, at the Buddha's request, was ordained by Sáriputta. The account of this event is given in Vin.i.82; this is probably the only passage in the Pitakas where Ráhulamátá, is mentioned by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when the Buddha allowed women to join the Order, Ráhulamátá became a nun under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Mahá Pajápatí Gotamí&lt;/a&gt; (AA.i.198).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; identifies (AA.i.204f) Ráhulamátá with Bhaddakaccáná who, in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.i.25), is mentioned as chief among nuns in the possession of supernormal powers (mahábhiññappattánam). She was one of the four disciples of the Buddha who possessed such attainment, the others being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakkula')"&gt;Bakkula&lt;/a&gt;. She expressed her desire for this achievement in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this account Bhaddakaccáná is mentioned as the daughter of the Sákyan Suppabuddha and his wife Amitá.* She joined the Order under Pajápatí Gotamí in the company of Janapadakalyání (Nandá), and in the Order she was known as Bhaddakaccáná Therí. Later, she developed insight and became an arahant. She could, with one effort, recall one asankheyya and one hundred thousand kappas (AA.i.205).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* Cf. Mhv.ii.21f. It is said (DhA.iii.44f) that Suppabuddha did not forgive   the Buddha for leaving his daughter; Devadatta was Bhaddakaccaná's daughter,   and it has been suggested that Devadatta's enmity against the Buddha was for   reasons similar to her father's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Therí Apadána (Ap.ii.584ff ) an account is found of a Therí, Yasodhará </data>
<data>by name, who is evidently to be identified with Ráhulamátá, because she speaks of herself (vvs. 10, 11) as the Buddha's pajápatí before he left the household (agára), and says that she was the chief (pámokkhá sabbaissará) of ninety thousand women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diipankara')"&gt;Dípankara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, when the Bodhisatta was born as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumedha')"&gt;Sumedha&lt;/a&gt;, she was a brahmin maiden, Sumittá by name, and gave eight handfuls of lotuses to Sumedha, which he, in turn, offered to the Buddha. Dípankara, in declaring that Sumedha would ultimately become the Buddha, added that Sumittá would be his companion in several lives. The Apadána account (vvs. 1ff ) mentions how, just before her death, at the age of seventy eight, she took leave of the Buddha and performed various miracles. It also states (Ap.ii.592f ) that eighteen thousand arahants nuns, companions of Yasodhará, also died on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abbhantara_jat_281')"&gt;Abbhantara Játaka&lt;/a&gt;* mentions that Bimbádeví (who is called the chief wife of Gotama and is therefore evidently identical with Ráhulamátá) was once, after becoming a nun, ill from flatulence. When Ráhula, as was his custom, came to visit her, he was told that he could not see her, but that, when she had suffered from the same trouble at home, she had been cured by mango juice with sugar. Ráhula reported the matter to his preceptor, Sáriputta, who obtained the mango juice from Pasenadi. When Pasenadi discovered why the mango juice had been needed, he arranged that from that day it should be regularly supplied. The Játaka relates how, in a past birth too, Sáriputta had come to Ráhulamátá's rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* J.ii.392f.; cf. the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/supatta_jat_292')"&gt;Supatta Játaka&lt;/a&gt;, where Sáriputta, at Ráhula's request, </data>
<data>  obtained for her from Pasenadi rice with ghee, flavoured with red fish. This   was for abdominal pain (J.ii.433).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous stories are found in the Játaka Commentary in which Ráhulamátá is identified with one or other of the characters -  e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the queen consort in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abbhantara_jat_281')"&gt;Abbhantara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sammillabhásiní in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/ananusociya_jat_328')"&gt;Ananusociya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Samuddavijayá in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aaditta_jat_424')"&gt;Áditta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Udayabhaddá in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udaya_jat_458')"&gt;Udaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the potter's wife (?

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ráhu&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Asura chieftain (Asurinda) (cp. Mtu.iii.138, 254). The Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.49f) says that on one occasion when he seized Candimá (Moon god), and on another Suriya (Sun god), both these invoked the aid of the Buddha. The Buddha then instructed Ráhu to let them free. Ráhu immediately let them go and ran to Vepacitti, &quot;trembling and with stiffened hair.&quot; This incident evidently refers to the Indian myth of the eclipses, and the legend has been annexed by the Buddhists to illustrate the Buddha's power and pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere (A.ii.17) Ráhu is spoken of as the chief of those possessing personality (attabháva). The Commentaries (E.g., AA.ii.474; DA.ii.487f.; MA.ii.790; SA.i.86, contains more details and differs slightly) explain that he is four thousand eight hundred leagues in height, and that the breadth of his chest is one thousand two hundred yojanas. His hands and feet are two hundred leagues long, each finger joint measuring fifty leagues, the space between the eyebrows also measuring fifty leagues. His forehead is fifty leagues broad, and his head nine hundred leagues in height. His face measures one hundred leagues, his nose three hundred, and the depth of his mouth one hundred. He is jealous of the gods of the Sun and the Moon, and stands in their paths with wide open mouth. When they fall into his mouth, the gods abandon their abodes and flee for their lives. Sometimes he caresses their abodes with his hand only, or with the lower part of his jaw, or with his tongue. Sometimes he takes them up and places them against his cheek; but he cannot stop the course of either the Sun or the Moon; if he attempts to do so, he will meet with disaster. So he journeys along with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seizure of the Moon by Ráhu and the escape from him is often used as a </data>
<data>simile (E.g., SN. vs. 465; J.i.183, 274; iii.364, 377; iv.330; v.453; DhA.iv.19, etc.). Ráhu is one of the four &quot;stains&quot; (upakkilesá) of the Sun and the Moon, preventing them from shining in all their glory (A.ii.53; Vin.ii.295; cp. J.iii.365). He is further mentioned as one of the five causes of lack of rain (vassassa antaráya). When he gathers water into his hands and spills it into the ocean, there is no rain (A.iii.243). The idea seems to be that he gathers up the rain water which is in the sky in order to cool his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bring Ráhu down from the sky is mentioned as one of the impossible tasks (J.iii.477).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DA.i.285; MA.ii.790f ) that for a long time Ráhu did not visit the Buddha, he thought that being so tall he would fail to see the Buddha. One day, however, he decided to go, and the Buddha, aware of his intention, lay on a bed when he arrived, and, by his iddhi power, contrived to make himself so tall that Ráhu had to crane his neck to see his face. Ráhu, thereupon, confessed his folly and accepted the Buddha as his teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ráhu is mentioned (D.ii.259) as being among the Asuras who were present at the Mahásmaya and as blessing that assembly. In this context he is called Ráhubhadda. When Ráhu steps into the ocean, the water of the deepest part reaches only to his knees (DA.ii.488). Ráhu is also called Veroca, and Báli's hundred sons were called after him, he being their uncle (DA.ii.689). The name Ráhumukha is given to a form of torture (E.g., M.i.87; iii.164; Nid.154; Mil.197, 358), in which the victim's mouth is forced open by a stake and fire or spikes are sent through the orifice of the ear into the mouth, which becomes filled with blood (AA.i.293).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Rohana.&lt;/b&gt; A Sákiyan prince, one of the brothers of Bhaddakaccáná. He went over to Ceylon and there founded a settlement which was named after him.

Rohana.&lt;/b&gt; One of the three main provinces of early Ceylon comprising the south eastern part of the island, the Maháválukanadí forming its northern boundary. It was probably colonized by Rohana (3). The capital of the province was Mahágáma. When the northern parts of the island were in the hands of foreigners or usurpers, the Singhalese court, its nobles and loyalists, often sought refuge in Rohana. It seems, for the most part, to have been very little controlled from the capital, and many rebellions against the ruler of the capital originated in Rohana. See Dutthagámani and Vijayabáhu; also, e.g., Mhv.xxiii.13; xxxiii.37; xxxv.27f., 67, 125; Cv.xxxviii.12, 39; xli.89ff.; xliv.54; xlviii.59, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In times of persecution and scarcity the Buddhist monks found patronage and shelter among the inhabitants of Rohana (E.g., Mhv.xxxvii.6). Even till about 600 A.C., Rohana was regarded as a separate kingdom, holding, or at least claiming to hold, an independent position beside Anurádhapura (See, e.g., Cv.xlv.41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.

<data>conference regarding the heresy of Milinda, Rohana was lost in meditation, and a messenger had to be sent to fetch him. As punishment for this, he was charged with the task of persuading Nágasena to join the Order. To achieve this purpose, Rohana had to visit the house of Nágasena's father, Sonuttara, during seven years and ten months, without ever receiving even a kind word, till, at last, one day Sonuttara was pleased with his kindness and courtesy and gave him food daily at the house. When Nágasena grew up and learnt the Vedas, Rohana engaged him in discussion, as a result of which Nágasena joined the Order under Rohana, who, as his first preceptor, taught him the Abhidhamma. One day, Nágasena thought lightly of his teacher, and Rohana, reading his thoughts, chided him. Nágasena begged his forgiveness, but Rohana said he would forgive him only if he succeeded in refuting Milinda's heretical views. Mil. 7ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7.

His parents had taught him nothing, and after their death he squandered all their wealth and fell into debt. Unable to escape his creditors, he summoned them and took them to the banks of the Ganges, promising to show them buried treasure. Arrived there, he jumped into the river. He lamented aloud as he was being carried away by the stream. The Bodhisatta was then a golden hued deer living on the banks of the river, and, hearing the man's wailing of anguish, he swam into the stream and saved him. After having ministered to him, the deer set him on the road to Benares and asked him to tell no one of the existence of the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day the man reached Benares, proclamation was being made that the Queen Consort, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khemaa')"&gt;Khemá&lt;/a&gt;, having dreamed of a golden deer preaching to her, longed for the dream to come true. Mahádhanaka offered to take the king to such a deer and a hunt was organized. When the Bodhisatta saw the king with his retinue, he went up to the king and told him the story of Mahádhanaka. The king denounced the traitor and gave the Bodhisatta a boon that henceforth all creatures should be free from danger. Afterwards the Bodhisatta was taken to the city, where he saw the queen. Flocks of deer, now free from fear, devoured men's crops; but the king would not go against his promise and the Bodhisatta begged his herds to desist from doing damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta's&lt;/a&gt; ingratitude and wickedness. Devadatta was Mahádhanaka and Ananda the king. J.iv.255 63; the story is included in the Játakamálá (No. 26).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There the Nágas, led by their king, Mahákála, received it and took it to their abode in Mañjerika where a thúpa was built over them, with a temple attached, and great honour was paid to them. When Dutthagámani built the Mahá Thúpa and asked for relics to be enshrined therein, Mahinda sent Sonuttara to the Nága world to obtain these relies, the Buddha having ordained that they should ultimately be enshrined in the Mahá Thúpa. But Mahákála was not willing to part with them, and Sonuttara had to use his iddhi power to obtain them. A few of the relics were later returned to the Nágas for their worship.

He was the son of a banker of Rájagaha and lived a dissolute life, till one day, on witnessing the arrest of an adulterer, he was very agitated and joined the Order. As a monk, too, he lived in luxury, in a well furnished room hence his name. Later, seized with remorse, he wandered out of his cell. On the way he saw a carter refresh a weary bull and then re-yoke him. Determined to take up his duties as a monk, he sought Upáli, and, with his help, attained arahantship. In the past he had offered koranda flowers to Vipassí Buddlha (Thag.vs.45; ThagA.i.115f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Korandapupphiya Thera of the Apadána.

Rádha Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a brahmin of &lt;a href="raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; who, being neglected by his children in his old age, sought ordination. The monks refused his request on the ground of his age, so he sought the Buddha who, seeing his upanissaya, asked Sáriputta to admit him.* Soon after he won arahantship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stayed near the Buddha, and, by reason of his skill, the Buddha declared him foremost among those who could inspire speech in others (? patibhánakeyyánam) (A.i.25; ThagA.i.253f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He thereby earned the name of Patibhániya Thera (SA.ii.246). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragáthá (vss.133 4) contains two verses spoken by him in praise of concentration of the mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rádha Samyutta (S.iii.188 201; see also &lt;a href="radha_sutta')"&gt;Rádha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;) contains a large number of suttas preached by the Buddha in answer to Rádha's questions on various topics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that when the Buddha saw Rádha he felt the inclination to talk on matters dealing with subtle topics, illustrating them with various similes. SA.ii.246; this was because of Radha's wealth of views (ditthisamudácára) and </data>
<data>unwavering faith (okappaniya-saddhá); AA.i.179; also ThagA.i.254.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* It is probably this incident which is referred to at ThagA.ii.114, where   Sáriputta is said to have ordained a poor brahmin named Rádha, but no mention   is made of any order from the Buddha. If the reference is to this same thera,   Rádha was, for some time, the attendant (pacchásamana) of Sáriputta, and there   is a verse in Thag. (993) spoken to him by Sáriputta, who was pleased with   Rádha's gentle manner. DhA.ii.104ff. gives more details of the ordination of   Rádha. There we are told that he went to the monastery where he performed   various duties. But the monks would not admit him into the Order, and, owing   to his disappointment, he grew thin. One day the Buddha, seeing him with his   divine eye, went to him, and hearing of his wish to join the Order, summoned   the monks and asked if any of them remembered any favour done by Rádha.   Sáriputta mentioned that he had once received a ladleful of Rádha’s own food   while begging in Rájagaha. The Buddha then suggested that Sáriputta should   listen to Rádha’s request for ordination. After ordination, Rádha grew weary   of the food of the refectory, but Sáriputta constantly admonished him and   found him most humble; later, he spoke highly of Rádha's obedience, and the   Buddha praised him. It was on Rádha's account that the   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aliinacitta_jat_156')"&gt;Alínacitta Játaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached. AA.i.179f. agrees, more or less, with the account given   above; so does Ap.ii.485f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Rádha was a householder of Hamsavatí and held a great almsgiving in honour of the Buddha, wishing to gain pre eminence in the power of inspiring others to speak.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rakkha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Rakkha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A general of Parakkamabáhu I. He was originally the Dandádhináyaka (? general) of Gajabáhu, but Parakkamabáhu won him over and put him in charge of the conquest of the Malaya country. He accomplished this with the help of his younger brother, after fighting many battles and subduing the chiefs of the various districts (Cv.lxx.5ff). The king thereupon conferred on him the rank of Kesadhátu. Later, he subdued the district of Merukandara and was sent against the Mahálekha Mahinda, whom he defeated at Sarogámatittha. He was associated with Nagaragiri Nátha in the fight against Mánábharana near Badaravallí. After this he is referred to as Adhikárí Rakkha, and the war against Mánábharana seems to have been chiefly in his charge. He was in command of the army at Mangalabegáma and Mihiranabibbila, and decisively defeated Mánábharana's general, Buddhanáyaka at Rajatakedára. Later, when Queen Sugalá raised a revolt in Rohana, it was Rakkha who was sent to crush it. He was by now commander in chief, and was helped in the subjugation of Rohana by the general Bhúta. They fought a battle at Lokagalla and advanced to Majjhimagáma and occupied Uddhanadvára, where Rakkha was helped by the two Kittis, the Adhikári and the Jívapotthakí. From there they marched to Mahárívara, and at Badaguna crushed Sugalá's forces, thus gaining possession of the Sacred Bowl and the Sacred Tooth which these forces were carrying. In a last onslaught at Dematavala, Rakkha put the enemy to flight and marched on to Sappanárukokilla, where he died of an attack of dysentery. Cv.lxx. 5, 15, 19, 282, 295; lxxii.2ff., 107, 160, 207, 232, 265ff.; lxxiv. 41ff. 55, 72ff., 111ff., 136ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Rakkha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;called Lankádhinátha. A general of Parakkamabáhu I. He helped Lokajitvána to </data>
<data>defeat Hukitti, and was later sent to Janapada to fight against Gajabáhu's forces. He was successful, and occupied Yagálla and Talátthala. Gajabáhu tried to win him over with bribes, but Rakkha mutilated the envoys and sent the presents to Parakkamabáhu. He fought at Aligáma against Gajabáhu's general, Síka, and, proving victorious, held a great celebration. Later he was in charge of the successful attack on Pulatthipura, when the city was captured and Gajabáhu taken prisoner. He was then sent to Mangalabegáma against Mánábharana, and fought so fiercely that the latter was forced to flee to Rohana. Rakkha was placed in charge of the ford at Nigundiváluká. He was, however, greatly offended by the favour shown by Parakkamabáhu to his rival, the Senápati Deva, and no longer showed himself zealous in war. An officer of Gajabáhu who was with Rakkha, noticing this, sent word to Mánábharana to come at once and take advantage of Rakkha's lethargy. Mánábharana followed this advice and advanced against Rakkha, whom he killed in the course of a fierce battle. Cv.lxx. 24, 98ff., 115ff., 174, 232, 283, 297, 306; lxxii.37, 75ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Rakkha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;called Mahálekha. He was an officer of Parakkamabáhu I. and took part in the campaigns against Mánábharana, being stationed at Mangalabegáma, at Pillavitthi. At this place he fought a battle, which lasted for eight days, against Buddhanáyaka and Mahámáladeva, and brought the district of Kálavápi under his power. Cv.lxxii.161, 170ff., 182, 206.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Rakkha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;called Damiládhikári. He was an officer of Parakkamabáhu I., and was one of those chiefly responsible for the subjugation of Rohana. He fought battles at Donivagga, Guralatthakalañcha, Púgadandakáváta, Bodhiáváta, Bhinnálavanágáma and several other places, and inflicted severe defeats on the rebel forces, dealing </data>
<data>them a severe blow at Mahásenagáma, where Lankápura Rakkha was killed. This enabled him to take possession of Mahánágahula. In order to bring the province completely under his control he had to fight further at Bakagalla Uddhavápi, Sanghabhedakagáma, Kuravakagalla and Mahápabbata, and he thus won full possession of Dvádasasahassaka, where he seems to have spent the rest of his days. Cv.lxxv.20, 69ff., 74ff., 87 159.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Rakkha Kañcukínáyaka&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An officer of Parakkamabáhu I., associated with Damiládhikárí Rakkha. He fought victorious battles at Maháválukagáma, Devanagara, Kammáragáma, Mahápanálagáma, Mánakapitthi, Nílavalá Ford and Kadalípatta, and marching then through Márávaratthali, he assisted Damiládhikárí Rakkha in the capture of Mahánágahula. Cv.lxxv. 20ff., 35ff., 52ff., 116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Rakkha Lankápura&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the leaders of the rebels in Rohana in the time of Parakkamabáhu I. He was later made their commander in chief. He advanced with his forces to Nadíbhandagáma, and was killed in the battle at Mahásenagáma, fighting against Damiládhikárí Rakkha. His place in the army was taken by his elder brother. Cv.lxxv.70, 103, 112, 134.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ratanapásáda&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A building in the Abhayagiri vihára, erected by King Kanitthatissa for Mahánága Thera (Mhv.xxxvi.8; for its identification see Cv.Trs.i.123, n.2). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda II. evidently rebuilt it at a cost of three hundred thousand kahápanas, and installed in it a Buddha image worth sixty thousand. At the dedication festival, the king offered his whole kingdom to the image (Cv.xlviii.135f). Mahinda III. gave the revenue from the Getthumba Canal for the repairs of the pasáda (Cv.xlix.41). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the reign of Sena I. the Pánidíyas, who invaded Ceylon, plundered the pásáda and removed the jewels from the eyes of the image (Cv.l.43). Sena II. found the image itself removed from its pedestal and taken to Madhurá, and, after his victory over the Pánndiyas, he had it restored (Cv.li.22,49). When the people rose in rebellion against Udaya III., he took refuge in the Ratanapásáda with his colleagues, but the people surrounded the building and they were forced to flee (Cv.liii.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

A new king &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessavana')"&gt;Vessavana&lt;/a&gt; was appointed by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;, and the king gave orders to the tree sprites to choose their abodes. The Bodhisatta advised his kinsmen to choose trees near his own. Some did not follow his advice and dwelt in the lonely trees. A tempest came and uprooted the lonely trees, leaving the trees in the grove unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was one of those related by the Buddha to the Sákiyans and Koliyans, who fought for the waters of the &lt;a href="rohini')"&gt;Rohiní&lt;/a&gt;. He wished to show them the value of concord (J.i.327ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For another Játaka, not found in the Játaka Commentary, but quoted in the Anguttara Nikáya and sometimes (E.g., ThagA.i.397) referred to as the Rukkhadhamma Játaka, see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppatitthita')"&gt;Suppatittha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He belonged to a wealthy family of Sávatthi, and left the world impressed by the presentation of Jetavana. Dwelling in the forest, he practiced meditation, and, because of his attainments and charm, he was called Rámaneyyaka. Once Mára tried to frighten him, but without success. The verse he uttered on that occasion is included in the Theragáthá (Thag. vs. 49).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhí Buddha, he had offered him flowers. Twenty nine kappas ago he was king under the name of Sumedhayasa (v.l. Sumeghaghana) (ThagA.i.120f). He is probably identical with Minelapupphiya of the Apadána. Ap.i.203f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Rámaneyyaka Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks him what it is which, by situation, is enjoyable. The Buddha replies that whatever place is occupied by the arahants that is the most enjoyable. S.i.232; cp. DhA.ii.195; the verse here ascribed to the Buddha is, in the Thag. (vs. 991) attributed to Sáriputta. Both there and in DhA. (see above) the verse is uttered in reference to Sáriputta's brother, Revata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rájadatta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant. He belonged to a caravan leader's family of Sávatthi, and was so called because he was born through the favour of Vessavana. When he came of age he took a caravan of five hundred carts to Rájagaha. Then, having squandered all his money, he went to Veluvana, and, after hearing the Buddha preach, entered the Order and lived in a charnel field. While wandering about, he saw the mangled body of a murdered courtesan and only with a great effort saved himself from distraction of mind. Later, he induced jhána and won arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen kappas ago he had seen a Pacceka Buddha at the foot of a tree and had given him an ambátaka (mango?) fruit (Thag. vss. 315-19; ThagA.i.402f). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Ambátaka Thera.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rajja Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Buddha was thinking compassionately of those suffering from the cruelty of rulers and wondering if it were possible to rule without causing suffering. Mára approaches and tries to make him absorbed in the fascination of exercising power, suggesting that if the Buddha wished he could change even the Himálaya into a mass of gold. But, says the Buddha, he has seen suffering and its source and will not, therefore, incline to sense desires. S.i.116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the time of the Buddha, the setthi was the brother in law of Anáthapindika and was a devout follower of the Buddha; he was responsible for the meeting between the Buddha and Anáthapindika (For details see Anáthapindika). He had a slave girl named Punná (DhA.iii.321ff ) and a slave Punna, who later became a setthi, and whose daughter, Uttará, was given in marriage to the son of the Rájagahasetthi. This latter was an unbeliever, but was later converted and became a sotápanna. See VvA.63ff. for details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He had a brother, Cittamiga, and a sister Sutaná. One day Khemá, wife of the king of Benares, dreamed that a golden deer preached to her and begged the king to make the dream come true. The king offered great rewards, and a hunter, who was aware of Rohanta's existence, undertook to bring him to the court. He set a trap in the ford where the deer drank and Rohanta was caught in it. When Rohanta gave the alarm, all the deer fled except Cittamiga and Sutaná. They told the hunter that they would die with their brother rather than leave him, and the hunter, touched by their devotion, set Rohanta free. When Rohanta discovered why he had been caught, he offered to go to Benares, but was dissuaded by the hunter owing to the risks he would run. Rohanta then taught the Law to the hunter and sent him back with a golden hair from his body. The hunter related the story to the king and queen and preached to them the Law. Then rejecting the rewards they offered him, he became an ascetic in the Himálaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Ananda's attempt to throw himself before the elephant Dhanapála, who was sent to kill the Buddha. Ananda is identified with Cittamiga, Channa with the hunter, Sáriputta with the king and Uppalavanná with Sutaná. J.iv.413ff.; some of the verses of this Játaka are found also in the Tesakuda Játaka (J.v.123f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

(SNA.i.326; DhA.i.73, etc.; in Sanskrit texts (e.g., Dvy.395) Sáriputta is called Sáradvatíputra). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her husband was the brahmim &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vanganta')"&gt;Vanganta&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.ii.84), and she became the mother of seven children, all of whom became arahants - &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upasena')"&gt;Upasena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda')"&gt;Mahácunda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="revata')"&gt;Revata Khadiravaniya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caalaa')"&gt;Cálá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upacaalaa')"&gt;Upacálá&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sisupacala_theri')"&gt;Sisúpacálá&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.ii.188; SA.iii.172). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both she and her husband were unbelievers, and she was very sad when, one after another, her children, giving up wealth worth eighty crores, joined the Order. She wished to keep at least the youngest of the boys, Revata, for herself, and had him married at the age of seven, but her plot miscarried (See Revata). This embittered her against the monks, and, though she gave them alms when they came to the house, she blamed them for having enticed her children away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Sáriputta visited her with five hundred monks, among whom was &lt;a href="raahula')"&gt;Ráhula&lt;/a&gt;, she invited them in and gave them food, but did not fail to abuse her son, calling him &quot;eater of leavings&quot; (ucchitthakhádaka) (DhA.iv.164f). She outlived Sáriputta, who visited her just before his death, at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nala')"&gt;Nálakagáma&lt;/a&gt;, in the house where he was born. There she provided lodging for him and his five hundred </data>
<data>companions. Sáriputta fell ill of a violent attack of dysentery on the night of his arrival, and she saw various gods, including even &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka')"&gt;Mahá Brahmá&lt;/a&gt;, come to wait on him. Learning their identity from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda')"&gt;Mahá Cunda&lt;/a&gt;, she was amazed and went to see Sáriputta to have Mahá Cunda's words confirmed. Sáriputta told her how Mahá Brahmá was a follower of the Buddha and talked to her about the marvellous virtues of his teacher. At the end of his talk, she became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. Sáriputta died the next day at dawn, and she made elaborate arrangements for his cremation (SA.iii.172ff.; for details see Sáriputta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She seems to have also been called &lt;b&gt;Surúpasárí&lt;/b&gt;.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city, the capital of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;. There seem to have been two distinct towns; the older one, a hill fortress, more properly called Giribbaja, was very ancient and is said (VvA. p.82; but cp. D.ii.235, where seven cities are attributed to his foundation) to have been laid out by Mahágovinda, a skilled architect. The later town, at the foot of the hills, was evidently built by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt; says (Beal, ii.145) that the old capital occupied by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; was called Kuságra. It was afflicted by frequent fires, and Bimbisára, on the advice of his ministers, abandoned it and built the new city on the site of the old cemetery. The building of this city was hastened on by a threatened invasion by the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt;. The city was called Rájagaha because Bimbisára was the first person to occupy it. Both Hiouen Thsang and Fa Hsien (Giles: 49) record another tradition which ascribed the foundation of the new city to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pargiter (Ancient Ind. Historical Tradition, p.149) suggests that the old city was called Kuságrapura, after Kuságra, an early king of Magadha. In the Rámáyana (i. 7, 32) the city is called Vasumatí. The Mahábhárata gives other names -  Bárhadrathapura (ii.24, 44), Varáha, Vrsabha, Rsigiri, Caityaka (see PHAI.,p.70).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also called Bimbisárapurí and Magadhapura (SNA.ii.584).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both names were used indiscriminately (E.g., S.N. vs. 405), though Giribbaja seems, as a name, to have been restricted to verse passages. The place </data>
<data>was called Giribbaja (mountain stronghold) because it was surrounded by five hills -  Pandava, Gijjhakúta, Vebhára, Isigili and Vepulla* - and Rájagaha, because it was the seat of many kings, such as Mandhátá and Mahágovinda (SNA.ii.413). It would appear, from the names given of the kings, that the city was a very ancient royal capital. In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545')"&gt;Vidhurapandita Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.271), Rájagaha is called the capital of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga')"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt;. This evidently refers to a time when Anga had subjugated Magadha. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* SNA.ii.382; it is said (M.iii.68) that these hills, with the exception of   Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vankaka for Vepulla (S.ii.191).   The Samyutta (i.206) mentions another peak near Rájagaha -  Indakúta. See   also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalasilaa')"&gt;Kálasilá&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., SNA. loc. cit) explain that the city was inhabited only in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddhas&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakkavatti&lt;/a&gt; kings; at other times it was the abode of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yakkha')"&gt;Yakkhas&lt;/a&gt; who used it as a pleasure resort in spring. The country to the north of the hills was known as Dakkhinágiri (SA.i.188).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rájagaha was closely associated with the Buddha's work. He visited it soon after the Renunciation, journeying there on foot from the River Anomá, a distance of thirty leagues (J.i.66). Bimbisára saw him begging in the street, and, having discovered his identity and the purpose of his quest, obtained from him a promise of a visit to Rájagaha as soon as his aim should be achieved (See the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pabbajja_sutta')"&gt;Pabbajjá Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and its Commentary). During the first year after the </data>
<data>Enlightenment therefore, the Buddha went to Rájagaha from&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gayaa')"&gt;Gayá&lt;/a&gt;, after the conversion of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa')"&gt;Tebhátika Jatilas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha's entry into the royal quarters, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha. It was during this visit that Bimbisára gifted &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt; to the Order and that the Buddha received &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th')"&gt;Moggallána&lt;/a&gt; as his disciples. (Details of this visit are given in Vin.i.35ff ). Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those ordained were the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s5_say')"&gt;Sattarasavaggiyá&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaali')"&gt;Upáli&lt;/a&gt; at their head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rájagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dakkhinaagiri')"&gt;Dakkhinágiri&lt;/a&gt; and then to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.77ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.13), the Buddha spent also in Rájagaha the third, fourth, seventeenth and twentieth vassa. After the twentieth year of his teaching, he made &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt; his headquarters, though he seems </data>
<data>frequently to have visited and stayed at Rájagaha. It thus became the scene of several important suttas -  e.g., the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aataanaatiya_s')"&gt;Atánátiya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udumbarika_s')"&gt;Udumbarika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapasiihanaada_s')"&gt;Kassapasíhanáda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jiivaka_s')"&gt;Jívaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasakuludayi_s')"&gt;Mahásakuladáyí&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other incidents in the Buddha's life connected with Rájagaha, see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;. The most notable of these was the taming of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalaagiri')"&gt;Nálágiri&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rájagaha. Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajátasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vassakaara')"&gt;Vassakára&lt;/a&gt;, to the Buddha at Gijjhakúta, to find out what his chances of success were (D.ii.72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, Rájagaha was chosen by the monks, with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th')"&gt;Mahá Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sattapanniguha')"&gt;Sattapanniguhá&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt; extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage (Vin.ii.285; Sp.i.7f.; DA.i.8f., etc.). The king also erected at Rájagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share (D.ii.166). According to the Mahá Vamsa, (Mhv.xxxi.21; MT. 564) some time later, acting on the suggestion of Mahá Kassapa, the king gathered at Rájagaha seven donas of the Buddha's relics which had been deposited in various places -  </data>
<data>excepting those deposited at Rámagáma -  and built over them a large thúpa. It was from there that Asoka obtained relics for his viháras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rájagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha's time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it. The others cities were &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaa')"&gt;Campá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saketa')"&gt;Sáketa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambí&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.147).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt; to Rájagaha was one hundred and ninety two leagues long and passed through Sávatthi, which was forty five leagues from Rájagaha. This road passed by the gates of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; (MA.ii.987; SA.i.243). The Paráyana Vagga (SN. vss.1011-3) mentions a long and circuitous route, taken by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari')"&gt;Bávarí's&lt;/a&gt; disciples in going from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patitthaana')"&gt;Patitthána&lt;/a&gt; to Rájagaha, passing through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maahissati')"&gt;Máhissati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gonaddha')"&gt;Gonaddha&lt;/a&gt;, Vedisá. &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vanasa')"&gt;Vanasavhaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii')"&gt;Kosambí&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saketa')"&gt;Sáketa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/setavya')"&gt;Setavyá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa')"&gt;Kusinárá&lt;/a&gt;, on to Rájagaha, by way of the usual places (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt; to Rájagaha was sixty leagues (AA.i.115; MA.i.360). From </data>
<data>Rájagaha to Kusinárá was a distance of twenty five leagues (DA.ii.609), and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaparinibbana_s')"&gt;Mahá Parinibbána Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.72ff ) gives a list of the places at which the Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road  -&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambalatthikaa')"&gt;Ambalatthiká&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa')"&gt;Nálandá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama')"&gt;Pátaligáma&lt;/a&gt; (where he crossed the Ganges), &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kotigaama')"&gt;Kotigáma&lt;/a&gt;, Nádiká (??), &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt;, Bhandagáma, Hatthigáma, Ambagáma, Jambugáma, Bhoganagara, Pává, and the Kakuttha River, beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sála grove of the Mallas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Rájagaha to the Ganges was a distance of five leagues, and when the Buddha visited Vesáli at the invitation of the Licchavis, the kings on either side of the river vied with each other to show him honour. DhA.iii.439f.; also Mtu.i.253ff.; according to Dvy. (p.55) the Ganges had to be crossed between Rájagaha and Sávatthi, as well, by boat, some of the boats belonging to the king of Magadha and others to the Licchavis of Vesáli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distance between Rájagaha and Nálandá is given as one league, and the Buddha often walked between the two (DA.i.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books mention various places besides Veluvana, with its Kalandaka-nivápa vihára in and around Rájagaha -  e.g., Sítavana, Jívaka's Ambavana, Pipphaliguhá, Udumbarikáráma, Moranivápa with its Paribbájakáráma, Tapodáráma, Indasálaguhá in Vediyagiri, Sattapanniguhá, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, Supatitthacetiya, Pásánakacetiya, Sappasondikapabbhára and the pond Sumágadhá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Buddha’s death, there were eighteen large monasteries in Rájagaha (Sp.i.9). Close to the city flowed the rivers Tapodá and Sappiní. In </data>
<data>the city was a Potter's Hall where travelers from far distances spent the night. E.g., Pukkusáti (MA.ii.987); it had also a Town Hall (J.iv.72). The city gates were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city. Vin.iv.116f.; the city had thirty-two main gates and sixty four smaller entrances (DA.i.150; MA.ii.795). One of the gates of Rájagaha was called Tandulapála (M.ii.185). Round Rájagaha was a great peta world (MA.ii.960; SA.i.31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Buddha's time there was constant fear of invasion by the Licchavis, and Vassakára (q.v.) is mentioned as having strengthened its fortifications. To the north east of the city were the brahmin villages of Ambasandá (D.ii.263) and Sálindiyá (J.iii.293); other villages are mentioned in the neighborhood, such as Kítágiri, Upatissagáma, Kolitagáma, Andhakavinda, Sakkhara and Codanávatthu (q.v.). In the Buddha's time, Rájagaha had a population of eighteen crores, nine in the city and nine outside, and the sanitary conditions were not of the best. SA.i.241; DhA.ii.43; it was because of the city's prosperity that the Mettiya-Bhummajakas made it their headquarters (Sp.iii.614). The city was not free from plague (DhA.i.232). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasurer of Rájagaha and Anáthapindika had married each other’s sisters, and it was while Anáthapindika (q.v.) was on a visit to Rájagaha that he first met the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Rájagaha, like those of most ancient cities, held regular festivals; one of the best known of these was the Giraggasamajjá (q.v.). Mention is also made of troupes of players visiting the city and giving their entertainments for a week on end. (See, e.g., the story of Uggasena).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the death of the Buddha, Rájagaha declined both in importance and prosperity. Sisunága transferred the capital to Vesáli, and Kálásoka removed it </data>
<data>again to Pátaliputta, which, even in the Buddha's time, was regarded as a place of strategically importance. When Hiouen Thsang visited Rájagaha, he found it occupied by brahmins and in a very dilapidated condition (Beal, op. cit., ii.167). For a long time, however, it seems to have continued as a center of Buddhist activity, and among those mentioned as having been present at the foundation of the Mahá Thúpa were eighty thousand monks led by Indagutta.

It is also included in the Sutta Nipáta (vss. 222 38); see also Gangárohana Sutta. It was preached at Vesáli, on the occasion of the Buddha's visit there at the invitation of the Licchavis, who begged him to rid the city of the various dangers which had fallen upon it. According to the Commentaries (SNA.i.278ff.; DhA.iii.436ff.; KhpA.164f), the Buddha first taught the sutta to Ananda and asked him to go round the city, accompanied by the Licchavi princes, reciting the sutta and sprinkling water from the Buddha's bowl. Immediately all the evil spirits fled from the city and the people recovered from their diseases. They then gathered at the Mote hall with various offerings and thither they conducted the Buddha. In the assembly were present not only all the inhabitants of Vesáli, but also the devas of two deva worlds, with Sakka at their head. The Buddha preached the Ratana Sutta to this great crowd. Another account, quoted by Buddhaghosa (DhA.iii.165), says that in the assembly the Buddha preached only the first five stanzas, the rest having been earlier recited by Ananda. Because this sutta was first preached to ward off the evil from Vesáli, it became the most famous of Buddhist Ward runes (Parittá)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta consists of seventeen verses: the first two contain a request to the devas to receive the homage and offerings of men and protect them in their danger; then follow twelve verses, descriptive of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. It ends with three verses purporting (DhA.iii.195) to have been spoken by Sakka on behalf of all the devas, expressing their adoration of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Sangha. It is also said (DhA.iii.196) that </data>
<data>during this visit the Buddha stayed at Vesáli for two weeks, preaching the sutta on seven consecutive days; on each day eighty four thousand beings realized the Truth. The Sutta seems also to have been known as the Gangárohana Sutta (Cv.xxxvii.191). When Ceylon was troubled by famine and plague in the reign of Upatissa II., the king had the sutta preached by monks while walking in the streets of the city. All troubles vanished, and he decreed that his successors should do likewise in times of need(Cv.xxxvii.195f). Sena II. had the whole sutta inscribed on a golden plate and held a great festival in its honour (Cv.li.79).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is given in the Mahávastu (i.290ff), where it is described as Svastyanagáthá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Ratana Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dígha Commentary (DA.i.250) refers the reader to a Ratana Sutta of the Bojjhanga Samyutta for details of the seven gems of a Cakkavatti. The reference is evidently to the Chakkavatti Sutta (q.v.). S.v.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The king gave him a horse with rich trappings, and, when he rode him, everybody was lost in admiration. Ruhaka's wife was a foolish old woman who, on hearing of the people's praise, declared that their excitement was due, not to the qualities of the animal, but to its trappings, and that if Ruhaka would go out wearing the horse's trappings, he would be similarly applauded. Ruhaka agreed to the suggestion and suffered great humiliation; he went home in anger, determined to punish his wife, but she had escaped and had sought the king's protection. The king persuaded Ruhaka to forgive her because “all womankind is full of faults.&quot; (J.ii.113ff )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The occasion for the story is given in the Indriya Játaka (No. 423) (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rohiní &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Rohiní Therí.&lt;/b&gt; She was the daughter of a prosperous brahmin of Vesáli. When the Buddha visited Vesáli, she heard him preach and became a sotápanna, taught the Doctrine to her parents, and, with their permission, entered the Order, where she became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety one kappas ago she saw Vipassí Buddha begging in Bandhumatí, and, filling his bowl with meal cakes, paid him homage (ThagA.214f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Therígithá (vss.271-90) contains a set of verses spoken by her in exaltation, when, after becoming an arahant, she recalled to mind the discussion she had had with her father while she was yet a sotápanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (ThigA.219f) that the last stanza of the series was spoken by her father, who later himself joined the Order and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Rohiní.&lt;/b&gt; Sister of Anuruddha Thera. When he visited his family at Kapilavatthu, she refused to see him because she was suffering from a skin eruption. But Anuruddha sent for her, and when she came, her face covered with a cloth, he advised her to erect an assembly hall for the monks. She consented to do this, sold her jewels, and erected a hall of two stories, the building of which was supervised by Anuruddha. At the dedication ceremony she entertained the Buddha and the monks. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha sent for her. She was reluctant to go to him owing to her disease, but was persuaded, and he told her the story of her past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long ago she had been the chief consort of the king of Benares, and being jealous of a dancing girl whom the king loved, she contrived to get powdered scabs on the girl's body, clothes and bed. The girl developed boils and her skin was ruined.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon, Rohiní's disease vanished and her body took on a golden color, while she herself was established in the First Fruit of the Path. After death, Rohiní was born in Távatimsa, at the meeting point of the boundaries of four deities. Because of her beauty, each deity claimed her as his, and they referred their quarrel to Sakka. Sakka, too, became enamored of her, and when he confessed his desire, they agreed to let hint take her, and she became his special favourite. DhA.iii.295ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Rohíní.&lt;/b&gt; A small river dividing the Sákyan and Koliyan countries. A dam was constructed across the river, and the people on the two sides used the water to cultivate their fields. Once, in the month of Jetthamúla, there was a drought, and a violent quarrel arose between the two peoples for the use of the water. A battle was imminent, when the Buddha, seeing what was about to happen, appeared in the air between the opposing forces in the middle of the river and convinced them of the folly of killing each other for the sake of a little water. It is said that he preached on this occasion the Attadanda Sutta and the Phandana, the Latukika and the Vattaka Játakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To show their gratitude to the Buddha for his timely intervention, the Sákyans and the Koliyans gave two hundred and fifty young men from each tribe to be ordained under him. SNA.i.358; cp. J.v.412; DhA.iii.254ff. The accounts differ in details; the Játaka account, which is the longest, mentions other Játakas: Daddabha and Rukkhadhamma. DA.ii.672f. and SA.i.53ff substitute Pathavudriyana for Daddabha. But see under these Játakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rohiní is identified with a small stream which joins the Rapti at Goruckpore. It is now called the Rowai or Rohwaini. For details see Cunningham, Arch. Survey of India xii.190ff.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Dhammapála says (ThagA.i.501) that the Rohiní flows from north to south and that Rájagaha lies to the south east of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Rohiní.&lt;/b&gt; An asterism (MA.ii.783; SNA.ii.456). The planting of the Bodhi tree in Ceylon was performed under this constellation. Mhv.ix.47 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Rohiní.&lt;/b&gt; A city which was the birthplace of Paccaya Thera. v.l. Rohí. ThagA.i.341.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Rohiní. &lt;/b&gt;A slave woman of Anáthapindika. See the Rohiní Játaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Rohiní. &lt;/b&gt;See Rohíta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rohiní Játaka &lt;/b&gt;(No. 45). Once the Bodhisatta was the Lord High Treasurer of Benares and he had a slave woman named Rohiní. One day, when Rohiní was pounding rice, her mother lay down near her and flies settled on her and stung her. When she asked her daughter to drive them away, the latter lifted her pestle and hit her with it, thinking thus to kill the flies. But instead of the flies she killed her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Anáthapindika in reference to a slave girl of his also named Rohiní, who killed her mother in the same way. The mother and daughter are the same in both stories. J.i.248f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Revata&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Revata.&lt;/b&gt; The fifth of the twenty four Buddhas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in Sudhaññaka (Sudhaññavatí), his father being the khattiya Vipula and his mother Vipulá. For six thousand years he lived in the household and then renounced the world, travelling in a chariot, leaving his wife Sudassaná and their son Varuna. The three palaces occupied by him in his lay life were Sudassana, Ratanagghi and Ávela. He practiced austerities for seven months and attained Enlightenment under a Nága tree, having been given milk rice by Sádhudeví and grass for his seat by the Ájívaka Varunindhara. His first sermon was preached at Varunáráma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was a brahmin of Rammavatí, named Atideva, who, seeing the Buddha, spoke his praises in one thousand verses. Among the Buddha's converts was King Arindama of Uttaranagara. The Buddha's chief disciples were Varuna and Brahmadeva among monks and Bhaddá and Subhaddá among nuns. His constant attendant was Sambhava. His chief lay patrons were Paduma and Kuñjara, and Sirimá and Yasavatí. His body was eighty hands in height, and his aura spread uninterruptedly to a distance of one yojana. He died in the Mahására pleasance at the age of sixty thousand, and his relics were scattered. Bu.vi.1ff.; BuA.131ff.; J.i.30, 35, 44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Revata. &lt;/b&gt;A monk, the personal attendant of Siddhattha Buddha. Bu.xvii.18; J.i.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Revata &lt;/b&gt;(called &lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="Khadiravaniya"&gt;Khadiravaniya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;). An arahant Thera. An eminent disciple of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, declared by him foremost among forest dwellers (araññakánam) (A.i.24). He was the youngest brother of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta')"&gt;Sáriputta&lt;/a&gt;, and a marriage was arranged </data>
<data>for him by his mother who was miserable at seeing her children desert her one after another to join the Order, and wished to keep the youngest at home. He was only seven years old, and, on the wedding day, the relations of both bride and bridegroom showered blessings on the couple and said to the bride: &quot;May you live as long as your grandmother.&quot; Revata asked to see the grandmother, and was shown a woman of one hundred and twenty, decrepit, and showing all the signs of advanced old age. Realizing that his wife would probably share the same fate, he left the bridal procession on some pretext on the way home, and ran away to a place where some monks lived. Sáriputta, foreseeing this, had instructed the monks to ordain his brother without reference to his parents, and, when Revata revealed his identity, the monks at once admitted him into the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sáriputta heard this, he wished to visit his brother, but was persuaded by the Buddha to wait. Revata, after waiting a long time for the visit from Sáriputta, obtained from his teachers a formula of meditation and himself set out to see the Buddha. On the way he stopped at a khadiravana (acacia forest) during the rainy season and there won arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the rains the Buddha, accompanied by Sáriputta and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;, with five hundred other monks, started out to visit Revata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were two routes leading to the khadiravana, of which the shorter was thirty leagues long, straight, but infested with evil spirits. This the Buddha chose because &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siivalii')"&gt;Sívalí Thera&lt;/a&gt; was in the company of monks, and the Buddha knew that the deities of the forest would provide the monks with all they needed because of Sívalí's presence. When Revata knew that the Buddha was approaching, </data>
<data>he created, by his magic power, splendid dwellings for him and his monks. The Buddha spent two months in the forest and then returned to the Pubbáráma in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi')"&gt;Sávatthi&lt;/a&gt;. There he found that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa')"&gt;Visákhá&lt;/a&gt; had heard contradictory accounts of the dwelling erected by Revata for the monks who had accompanied the Buddha. He dispelled Visákhá's doubts and spoke of Revata's powers. DhA.ii.188ff.; it was on this occasion that the Buddha related the story of Sivalí's past; see also DhA.iv.186f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the stanzas (No. 212), of the Muni Sutta was also preached to the monks, according to Buddhaghosa (SNA.i.261f.), in connection with Revata. This was immediately after the Buddha's talk to Visákhá, mentioned above. The story of Revata's ordination is also given at AA.i.126ff., with some variations in detail. The account given in ThagA.i.108ff. is much shorter; no mention is made of the Buddha's visit to the khadiravana. Here it is said that, after winning arahantship, Revata went to Sávatthi to greet the Buddha and Sáriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some time after, Revata returned to his native village and brought away with him his three nephews, sons of his three sisters, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caalaa')"&gt;Cálá&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upacaalaa')"&gt;Upacálá&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="file:///C:/Tipinet/Palikanon/english/pali_names/s/sisupacala_theri')"&gt;Sisúpacálá&lt;/a&gt;. Sáriputta heard of this and went to see Revata. Revata knowing that he was coming, exhorted his nephews to be particularly heedful, and Sáriputta expressed his pleasure at their behaviour. ThagA.i.110; his admonitory verse is given at Thag.vs.43; two verses uttered by Sáriputta in praise of Revata are given at Thag.vss.991-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ThagA.i.551f  mentions another incident which took place during </data>
<data>Revata's old age. He was in the habit of visiting the Buddha and Sáriputta from time to time after returning to his home in the khadiravana. Once, during a visit to Sávatthi, he stayed in a forest near the city. The police, on the track of some thieves, came upon him, and, finding him near the booty which the thieves had dropped in their flight, arrested him and brought him before the king. When the king questioned him, the Elder spoke a series of verses (Thag.646 58; Mrs. Rhys Davids speaks of Revata as a teacher of the Jain doctrine of ahimsá, Gotama the Man, p.116), demonstrating the impossibility of his committing such an act, and also by way of teaching the king the Dhamma. It is said (ThagA.l.555) that at the conclusion of the stanzas he sat cross legged in the sky until his body burnt itself out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revata loved solitude, and, on one occasion (DhA.iii.325f), a lay disciple named Atula, hearing that he was in Sávatthi, went with five hundred others to hear him preach. But Revata said that he delighted in solitude and refused to address them, and Atula went away complaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revata's delight in solitude was sometimes misunderstood. For instance, the Elder Sanunñjani went about continually sweeping, and, seeing Revata sitting cross legged, thought him an idler. Revata read his thoughts and admonished him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Revata was a boatman at Payága on the Ganges, and once took the Buddha and his thousand followers across the river in a boat decked with canopies, flowers, etc. On that occasion he heard the Buddha declare one of the monks highest among forest dwellers, and wished for a similar honour for himself under a future Buddha (ThagA.i.108; A.A.i.126). Later, he was born in deva worlds. Fifty eight kappas ago he was a king named Tárana, and a kappa later another king named Campaka. Ap.i.51f.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;. Revata. &lt;/b&gt;The DhpA.iv.176f  mentions a novice Revata, with three others -  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankicca')"&gt;Sankicca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pandita')"&gt;Pandita&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sopaka')"&gt;Sopáka&lt;/a&gt; -  all four of whom became arahants at the age of seven. The Revata referred to is, very probably, the Revata (3) above. For their story see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancachiddageha')"&gt;Pañcachiddageha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Revata.&lt;/b&gt; See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kankhaa_revata')"&gt;Kankhá Revata&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Revata.&lt;/b&gt; Called &lt;b&gt;Soreyya Revata&lt;/b&gt;. He was one of the Elders who took a prominent part in the Second Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lived in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soreyya')"&gt;Soreyya&lt;/a&gt;, and, on discovering (by means of his divine ear) that the orthodox monks, led by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sambhuta')"&gt;Sambhúta Sánavásí&lt;/a&gt; and   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa')"&gt;Yasa Kákandakaputta&lt;/a&gt;, were anxious to consult him, Revata left Soreyya, and, travelling through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbara and Aggalapura, reached Sahajáti. There the monks met him and consulted him regarding the &quot;Ten Points.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He enquired into these, and, after condemning them as wrong, decided to end the dispute. The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjiputtakaa')"&gt;Vajjiputtakas&lt;/a&gt;, too, had tried to win Revata over to their side, but on failing to do so, persuaded Revata's pupil, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttara')"&gt;Uttara&lt;/a&gt;, to accept robes, etc., from them, and speak to his teacher on their behalf. Uttara did this, but was dismissed by Revata as an unworthy pupil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revata suggested that the dispute should be settled in Vesáli, and the monks </data>
<data>having agreed, he visited &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabbakama')"&gt;Sabbakámí&lt;/a&gt; -  who was the oldest monk then living and a pupil of Ananda (according to Mhv.iv.57, 60, Revata, himself was a pupil of Ananda and had seen the Buddha; cp. Dpv.iv.49) -  during the night, and talked to him on matters of doctrine. During the conversation, Sánavásí arrived and questioned Sabbakámí regarding the Ten Points, but the latter refused to express an opinion in private. On Revata's suggestion a jury of eight, four from either side, was appointed to go into the question. Revata himself was a member of this jury, and he it was who questioned Sabbakámí during the meeting, held in Válikáráma, regarding the Ten Points. All the Ten Points were declared to be wrong, and, at the end of the questions, seven hundred monks -  chosen from one hundred and twelve thousand, at the head of whom was Revata -  held a recital of the Dhamma, which recital therefore came to be called Sattasatí (&quot;Seven Hundred&quot;). This recital, according to the Mhv., lasted for eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vin.ii.299ff. The Mhv.iv.1ff gives an account of this Council, which account differs in numerous details. In both accounts it is Revata who takes the most prominent part in settling the dispute. The Mhv. introduces &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalaasoka')"&gt;Kálásoka&lt;/a&gt; as the patron of the Second Council; cp. Dpv.iv.46ff.; v.15ff.; Sp.i.33f.; it would appear from the Dpv. account that the heretics refused to accept the decision of Revata's Council and separated off, to the number of ten thousand, forming a new body called the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasanghika')"&gt;Mahásanghikas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Revata. &lt;/b&gt;An Elder of Ceylon. He was a Majjhimabhánaka, and, once, going to Revata (8) who lived in the Malaya country of Ceylon, he asked him for </data>
<data>a subject of meditation. The latter knowing that the former was a Majjhimabánake spoke to him of the difficulties facing such a one in meditation. The other at once agreed not to recite the Majjhima until his meditations should prove fruitful. He was given a topic of meditation, and attained arahantship nineteen years later. But when, at the end of that time, he again started to recite the Majjhima, he was never in doubt as to a single consonant. Vsm.i.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Revata.&lt;/b&gt; An Elder of Ceylon, living in the Malaya country of Ceylon. See Revata (7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Revata.&lt;/b&gt; Teacher of Buddhaghosa. He was very proficient in the Vedas, and, when Buddhaghosa visited him in his vihára and recited the Vedas, he was able to speak with contempt of Buddhaghosa's knowledge. Buddhaghosa then became his pupil, and was later sent by him to Ceylon to translate the Singhalese Commentaries into Páli. Cv.xxxvii.218ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Rámañña&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Páli name for Burma, referring particularly to the maritime provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the conversion of Rámañña to Buddhism, there was a constant intercourse between that country and Ceylon (So says also Cv.lxxvi.10f). Vijayabáhu I. sent an embassy to Anuruddha, king of Rámañña, and obtained from him learned and pious monks to re establish the Sangha in Ceylon (Cv.lxviii.8; lx.5ff.; but see Cv. Trs.i.n.4). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kings of Rámañña seem to have been in the habit of giving a special maintenance to Singhalese envoys sent to their country. The chief trade between the two countries was in elephants; the king of Rámañña made a gift of an elephant to every vessel bringing gifts from foreign lands. In the time of Parakkamabáhu I., relations were strained between the two countries as a result of insults paid by the king of Rámañña, and Parakkamabáhu sent a punitive expedition under the Damiládhikárin, Ádicca. This expedition started from Pallavanka, and some of the forces landed at Kusumí in Rámañña and the others at Papphálama. It is said that in a battle fought at Ukkama, the Singhalese forces killed the Rámañña king. Thereafter, through the intervention of the monks, peace was restored between the two countries, and the Ramanas, as the people of Rámañña were called, sent a yearly tribute to the king of Ceylon. For details of this expedition see Cv.lxxvi.10ff.; also Cv. Trs.ii.69, n.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, in order to escape being pulled by her hair, she had her head shaved; but her mistress then had a rope tied round her head, with which she pulled her about; hence her name. Unable to bear her life any longer, the slave went into the village near by, intending to commit suicide, but there she found the Buddha waiting for her, and he preached to her. Rajjumálá, became a sotápanna, and then returned to her mistress, who, having heard her story, visited the Buddha and became his follower. The Buddha explained that the two women had had their positions reversed in a previous birth, and that the then slave, who was the mistress in the present birth, had vowed vengeance for the cruelty inflicted upon her. Rajjumálá was freed and was born after death in Távatimsa. Vv.iv.12; VvA.206ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was one of the eight consulted by Suddhodana regarding his son, the future Buddha. J.i.56; Mil.236.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ráma. &lt;/b&gt;King of Benares. He suffered from a virulent skin disease, and, leaving his kingdom to his eldest son, went into the forest, where he was cured by eating medicinal herbs. In the forest he met and married Piyá, the eldest daughter of Okkáka. She suffered from the same complaint, and was cured by him. They lived in the forest with their thirty two children. A forester recognized Ráma in the forest, and, on his return to the city, told the news to the king. The king went to the forest with his retinue and begged his father to return to the kingdom. He refused to do so, and, at his own suggestion, a city was built for him in the forest which was called Koliya or Vyagghapajja. Ráma thus became the ancestor of the Koliyans. DA.i.260ff.; SNA.355f.; cf. Mtu.i.355, where he is called Kola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Ráma. &lt;/b&gt;A brahmin, father of the Buddha's teacher, Uddaka Rámaputta (q.v.). J.i.66; M.i.165.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Ráma. &lt;/b&gt;The Bodhisatta born as the eldest son of Dasaratha, king of Benares. He is also called Rámapandita. He married his sister Sítá, and her devotion to him became proverbial (E.g., J.iv.559, 560; Cv.lxxiii.137). For Ráma's story see the Dasaratha Játaka. Certain ruling princes of Ceylon claimed descent from Ráma   e.g., Jagatipála (q.v.). Ráma's fight with Rávana and the incidents recounted in the Rámáyana are mentioned only in the later Páli Chronicles, such as the Cúlavamsa. Cv.lxiv.42; lxviii.20; lxxv.59; lxxxiii.46, 69, 88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Ráma. &lt;/b&gt;A Sákyan prince, brother of Bhaddakaccáná. He came to Ceylon, </data>
<data>where he founded the settlement of Rámagona. Mhv.ix.9; Dpv.x.4ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Ráma.&lt;/b&gt; Called Mátuposaka Ráma. He was an Inhabitant of Benares and greatly loved his parents. He once went on business to Kumbhavatí, in the country of Dandakí, and there, when the country was being destroyed owing to the wickedness of the king, Ráma thought of the goodness of his parents. The devas were moved by the power of this thought and conveyed him safely to his mother (J.v.29). He was one of the three survivors of the disaster which overtook Dandakí's kingdom. MA.ii.602.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Ráma.&lt;/b&gt; One of the palaces of Kondañña Buddha in his last lay life. BuA.107; but see Bu.iii.26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Ráma.&lt;/b&gt; One of the generals of Gajabáhu. Ráma was once defeated by the general Deva (Cv.lxx.137, 142), but later won a victory at the Mahárakkha ford. Ráma received the title of Nílagiri, which was evidently the name of his district. Cv.lxxii.12; Cv. Trs.i.299, n.1; 320, n.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Ráma. &lt;/b&gt;The second of the future Buddhas. Anágatavamsa, p. 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10.

He was a nobleman of Vesáli and left the world after hearing the Buddha preach the Ratana Sutta. After ordination, he dwelt in a pleasant hut in a beautiful forest, where he won arahantship. One day some women tried to tempt him, but in vain (Thag.58; ThagA.i.122f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first desire to attain liberation was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. Later he gave a beautiful seat to Atthadassí Buddha and offered him flowers in homage. One hundred and seventy kappas ago he was a king named Sandimá (Sannibbápaka). He is probably identical with Asanúpattháyaka of the Apadána. Ap.i.144.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The monk answered that a recluse should not be disturbed by other people's talk (S.i.201). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.i.227) explains that the monk was already an arahant, but the devatá did not know it and could not therefore understand why he spent his time in visiting householders, hence her question wishing to make him live in solitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The conversation that took place between Otthaddha and the Buddha is recorded in the Maháli Sutta (D.i.150ff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa calls Otthaddha a rájá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Okkáka.&lt;/b&gt;-A king, ancestor of the Sákyas and the Kolians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Ambattha Sutta (D.i.92) it is stated that Okkáka, being fond of his queen and wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished from the kingdom the elder princes by another wife. These princes were named Okkámukha, Karakanda, Hatthinika, and Sínipura. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávastu (which confuses Iksváku with his ancestor Sujáta) mentions five sons of Iksváku: Opura, Ulkámukha, Karandaka, Hastikasírsa and Nipura (i.348). See also Rockhill, p.9ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They lived on the slopes of the Himalaya and, consorting with their sisters and their descendants, formed the Sákyan race. The legend, thus briefly given, is enlarged on with great detail in the Commentaries. According to Buddhaghosa, there are three dynasties with a king named Okkáka at the head of each, all of them lineal descendants of the primeval king, Mahásammata, and in the line of succession of Makádeva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Okkáka of the third dynasty bad five queens - Bhattá, Cittá, Jantú, Jáliní and Visákhá - each with five hundred female attendants. The eldest queen had four sons - mentioned above - and five daughters - Piyá, Suppiyá, Anandá, Vijitá and Vijitasená. (The Mtu. calls them Suddhá, Vimalá Vijitá, Jálá and Jálí).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bhattá died, after the birth of these nine children, the king married another young and beautiful princess and made her the chief queen. Her son was Jantu, and being pleased with him, the king promised her a boon. She claimed the kingdom for her son, and this was the reason for the exile of the elder children (DA.i.258f; SnA.i.352f). &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahávamsa (Mhv.ii.12-16) mentions among Okkáka's descendants, Nipuna, Candimá, Candamukha, Sivisañjaya, Vessantara, Jáli, Síhaváhana and Síhassara. The last named had eighty-four thousand descendants, the last of whom was Jayasena. His son Síhahanu was the grandfather of the Buddha. The Dípavamsa (iii.41-5) list resembles this very closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okkáka had a slave-girl called Disá, who gave birth to a black baby named, accordingly, Kanha. He was the ancestor of the Kanháyanas, of which race the Ambattha-clan was an offshoot. Later, Kanha became a mighty sage and, by his magic power, won in marriage Maddarúpí, another daughter of Okkáka (D.i.93, 96).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Bráhmana-Dhammika Sutta (Sn.p.52ff; AA.ii.737), it was during the time of Okkáka that the brahmins started their practice of slaughtering animals for sacrifice. Till then there had been only three diseases in the world - desire, hunger and old age; but from this time onwards the enraged devas afflicted humans with various kinds of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DA.i.258) that the name Okkáka was given to the king because when he spoke light issued from his mouth like a torch (kathanakále ukká viya mukhato pabhá niccharati).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Sanskritised form of the Páli name is Iksaváku, it is unlikely that Okkáka is identical with the famous Iksaváku of the Puránas, the immediate son of Manu, son of the Sun. The Páli is evidently more primitive, as is shown by the form Okkámukha, and the name Iksaváku looks like a deliberate attempt at accommodation to the Puránic account. For discussion see Thomas, op. cit., p.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahávastu, Iksaváku was the king of the Kosalas and his capital was Sáketa - i.e. Ayodhyá.

The deva is puzzled by the answer, until it is explained to him that a wrong support of footing and misdirected effort are as fatal as drowning straight away. The deva expresses his adoration of the Buddha (S.i.1). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.i.14) adds that the deva was conceited, thinking he knew all about the saint ship of a Buddha, hence the enigmatic reply, in order to puzzle him (v.l.

Jotika, Jotiya.&lt;/b&gt;-A treasurer of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; who later became an arahant. In the past he had been a householder of Benares who, with his elder brother, owned a field of sugar-cane. One day, when returning from the field with some stalks of sugar-cane, he saw a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacceka_buddha')"&gt;Pacceka Buddha&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhamaadana')"&gt;Gandhamádana&lt;/a&gt; to whom he gave a bowl full of sugar-cane juice for him to drink, and when he had drunk it, gave him another bowlful which the Pacceka Buddha took to Gandhamádana to share with his colleagues. The householder, when proffering his gifts, wished for glory and for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/n_r/nibbaana')"&gt;Nibbána&lt;/a&gt;. His elder brother, hearing of this, was likewise filled with joy and he, too, wished for Nibbána.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassí Buddha they were again brothers in a rich family of Bandhumatí, the elder being called Sena and the younger Aparájita. Sena entered the Order and became an arahant. At his suggestion, Aparáijita (According to DhA.iii.364, both uncle and nephew were called Avaroja) built for the Buddha a very costly Gandhakuti, with the seven kinds of precious things. His nephew, also called Aparájita, built an elephant stable in front of the Gandhakuti and was reborn in this age as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mendaka')"&gt;Mendaka&lt;/a&gt;. The Gandhakuti and its surroundings contained all kinds of luxuries and splendours beyond description. (For details see DhA.iv.203f). Within and without the chamber he caused jewels, pounded and otherwise, to be strewn knee deep. Those who came to listen to the Buddha went away, their hands full of jewels. One day a brahmin tried to carry away a very </data>
<data>costly jewel, which much annoyed Aparàjita. On mentioning it to the Buddha, the Buddha taught him to make a wish that his property should not be taken away by thieves or lost by fire or water. For nine months Aparájita held the ceremony of dedication of the Gandhakuti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this age he was born as the son of a setthi in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;. On the day of his birth the whole city became one blaze of light, hence his name, Jotika. The king, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt;, gave one thousand a day for his milk-money. When the time came for his marriage, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; provided for him a palace, seven storeys high, made entirely of precious minerals. Four urns of treasure stood at the four corners and four stalks of sugar-cane made of solid gold, each the size of a palmyra tree with leaves of precious stones, to remind Jotika of his good deed in the past. Seven Yakkhas guarded the seven gates - Yamakolí, Uppala, Vajira, Vajirabáhu, Kasakanda, Katattha and Disápámukha - each with numerous followers. Bimbisára, hearing of his splendour, appointed Jotika to the rank of setthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gods brought him a wife from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarakuru')"&gt;Uttarakuru&lt;/a&gt; and lodged her in an apartment in Jotika's palace. Her name was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satulakayi')"&gt;Satulakáyí&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.iv.223). She brought with her a pint-pot of rice and three crystal fire-stones. Whenever they wished to eat, they would put rice over the boiler and set it over the crystals. The stones would immediately become alight and, when the meal was cooked, would extinguish themselves. The pot was inexhaustible. All who came to visit Jotika were provided with food and were allowed to take anything they wished from the treasure, the treasure never growing less. So great were the crowds which flocked to Jotika's palace that for </data>
<data>a long time Bimbisára had no chance of seeing it. When Bimbisára did in the end visit him with Ajátasattu, Jotika invited him to a meal which was the most dainty the king had ever tasted. After the meal Jotika presented his wife to Bimbisára; so delicately was she nurtured that the perfume with which the king was scented hurt her eyes! There were no lamps in Jotika's house; only the light of jewels was made use of, and as a memento of Bimbisára's visit Jotika gave him a huge jewel to be used as a lamp. (This account is taken from DhA.iv.199-213).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jotika was a very pious follower of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. Once, when he was away listening to the Buddha's preaching, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu')"&gt;Ajátasattu&lt;/a&gt; - who even when visiting the palace as a boy with his father had coveted Jotika's wealth - went with his soldiers to attack the palace in an attempt to take possession of it. But the Yakkha Yamakolí routed the army, and Ajátasattu fled for refuge to the vihára where Jotika was listening to the Dhamma. On being charged by Ajátasattu with hypocrisy in that he was there listening to the Dhamma, after having charged his guards to set upon the king, Jotika's answer was that he had no need of guards since nobody could take anything of his without his sanction. He then challenged the king to remove the rings from his (Jotika's) fingers. Ajátasattu, trying with all his might, failed. Jotika then held out his hands and his rings all fell off. Agitated by the king's desire to possess his wealth, Jotika asked for permission to become a monk. Ajátasattu agreed, hoping thus to get possession of his riches. Jotika entered the Order and soon became an arahant, but at the moment of his attainment of arahantship all his wealth and earthly glory vanished and his wife returned to Uttarakuru (DhA.iv.221-4).</data>

These five persons are described as amitabhogá (AA.i.220).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Jatila.&lt;/b&gt;-A class of ascetics, so called on account of their matted hair (jatilá ti tápasá, to hi jatádháritáya idha jatilá ti vuttá) (UdA.74; see also 330). These ascetics are sometimes classed under isi (Culla Nid.149) and also under muni (Culla Nid.513).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Jatila.&lt;/b&gt;-A governor of a province (Maháratthiya) in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He was the Bodhisatta. v.l. Jatika. J.i.37; Bu.xi.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Jatila (v.l. Jatilaka).&lt;/b&gt;-A setthi of Magadha, one of the five setthis of Bimbisára (DhA.i.385). His mother was a setthi's daughter in Benares, who had illicit relations with a Vijjádhara, and when the child was born she placed it in a vessel which she handed to her slave, to be floated down the Ganges. Two women, while bathing, saw the vessel, discovered what it contained and each claimed the child. The dispute was settled by the king and the child was given to the woman who happened to be a disciple of Mahá Kaccána. The child was called Jatila because the first time he was bathed after birth his hair became matted. When able to walk, he was given to Mahá Kaccána to be ordained, but the thera took him to Takkasilá and handed him over to one of his supporters, a merchant, who adopted him as his son. Years passed, and one day the merchant, having to go on a journey, made a list of the goods which he had accumulated in his house during twelve years and asked Jatila to sell them if he could find buyers. Such was the lad's fortune that in one day they were all disposed of. The merchant, realising the young man's destiny, gave him his daughter in marriage and provided him with a house. As Jatila stepped into the house, the earth behind it was rent asunder and a mountain of gold, </data>
<data>eighty cubits in height, appeared for his use. Thereupon the king made him a Treasurer. Later, wishing to retire from the world, Jatila sent out messengers to discover if there were others as rich as he, in case the king should raise objections to his going away. When news was brought back of Mendaka and Jotika, he knew there would be no opposition and obtained the king's permission. He had three sons, but, having tested them, came to know that only the youngest had the necessary good fortune to enjoy his vast wealth. Jatila thereupon handed over to him his wealth and entered the Order, becoming an arahant within a few days. Some time afterwards the Buddha, with Jatila and other monks, was entertained for a fortnight by Jatila's sons, and in answer to the monks' questions Jatila declared that he felt no desire to re-enter household life. The monks found this hard to believe till assured by the Buddha that it was so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jatila was a goldsmith. One day, an arahant, seeking for gold wherewith to complete the shrine erected over the Buddha's remains, came to the goldsmith's house; the latter, having just quarrelled with his wife, was in a surly mood and said to the arahant, &quot;Throw your teacher into the water and get away.&quot; His wife told him how wicked were his words, and he, realising his fault, asked pardon of the arahant and made valuable offerings at the Buddha's shrine, by way of amends. Of his three sons whom he asked, in turn, to help him with the preparations, only the youngest consented to go with him. Therefore it was that in seven successive states Jatila was thrown into the water on the day of his birth and only his youngest son could enjoy his wealth (DhA.iv.214ff; PsA.502f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jatila's possession of a golden mountain is given as an example of puññiddhi, he being one of the five persons of great </data>

He is mentioned as staying in Icchánangala (M.ii.196), where he evidently took part in the periodical gatherings of brahmin leaders - and also at Manasákata (D.i.235). He was a follower of the Buddha, of whom he was a great admirer. He appears to have been in the habit of talking to well known teachers of other schools and hearing their opinion of the Buddha, either for the purpose of comparing his own faith in him or of discovering their views. Two such conversations are recorded - one with Subha Todeyyaputta (M.ii.209), the other with Pilotika (M.i.175ff). His discussion with Pilotika he reported to the Buddha, who expanded it to form the Culahatthipadopama Sutta. The Buddha also preached to Jánussoni the Bhayabherava Sutta (M.i.16ff). Jánussoni's permanent residence was Sávatthi (DA.ii.399), and he often visited the Buddha at Jetavana, consulting him on many topics, such as: results of actions (A.i.56), sanditthaka-nibbána (A.i.157), tevijja-brahmins (A.i.166), fearlessness of death (A.ii.173), the ideals of various classes of persons (A.iii.362), true celibacy (A.iv.54), the Paccárohani ceremony (A.v.233ff., 249ff.), the efficacy of gifts (A.v.269ff.), and eternalism and annihilation (S.ii.76). He had a white chariot with silver fittings and white trappings drawn by four pure white mares. He would drive about in this, wearing white garments, turban-cloths and sandals and fanned by a white fan. The reins, the goads and the canopy were also of white. His chariot was considered the finest in all Sávatthi (S.v.4f; cp. M.i.175 and ii.208). Buddhaghosa says that Jánussoni was not his personal name but the name of the rank he held as chaplain to the Kosala king. MA.i.90; according to AA. (i.308) </data>

Jánussoní Sutta.-Jánussoní visits the Buddha and tells him that if anyone has gifts to distribute he should give them to the tevijja brahmins. At the Buddha's request, he describes these brahmins, and the Buddha, in his turn, tells him what is considered the threefold-lore (tevijjá) by the Ariyans. A.i.166.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Jánussoní Sutta.-Jánussoní visits the Buddha, who tells him that it is one extreme to say that everything exists, another to say nothing exists - and teaches him the Doctrine of the Middle Way, the paticcasamuppáda.

He saw a number of monks in a forest-lodge on the slopes of the Himálaya, muddled in mind, loose of speech and heedless. He appeared before them on an uposatha day and reminded them of their duties. S.i.61f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Jantu.-One of the five queens of Okkáka, founder of the third Okkáka dynasty. DA.i.258f; SNA.i.352f; MT.131.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Jantu.-Son of the third Okkáka, by a woman whom he appointed to be his chief queen when his first one, Hatthá, died. This woman was promised a boon and she asked that her son Jantu be appointed to succeed Okkáka, in preference to his other children. Okkáka first refused but was obliged to yield. His other sons and daughters thereupon left the kingdom and became the founders of the Sákiyan race (DA.258f; SNA.i.352f; MT.131).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahàvastu (i.348) calls Jantu, Jentá, and his mother Jentí. He reigned in Sáketa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His question and the Buddha's answer are found in the Jatukanni Sutta (SN.vv.1007, 1096-1100; Dvy.635).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Jatukanní was a banker in Hamsavatí, rich enough to lend money even to the king, Arindama. One day he saw the Buddha going along the street and, having invited him and twenty thousand monks, gave them a meal at his house. Ap.ii.357ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It was situated immediately before the south gate of the city (Ibid., 1, 7, 8). It was included in the boundaries of the Mahávihára and, later, Mahásena built the Jetavana-vihára in Jotivana (Mhv.xxxvii.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DA.i.131; see also Cv.xxxvii.65; lii.59) that when Mahinda preached at Jotivana there was an earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

There the banker &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mendaka')"&gt;Mendaka&lt;/a&gt; visited him and provided meals for him and the monks (DhA.iii.363; Vin.i.242f). Mendaka's grandson, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uggaha_menda')"&gt;Uggaha&lt;/a&gt;, did likewise (A.iii.36f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha once stayed in Játiyávana for three months, waiting for the ripening of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddaji_th')"&gt;Bhaddaji's&lt;/a&gt; wisdom, ready for his conversion (J.ii.331; ThagA.i.286).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vibhanga')"&gt;Sutta Vibhanga&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.iii.37f) contains the story of an arahant on whom a woman committed a misdemeanour while he was sleeping in Játiyávana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; (AA.ii.597) says that the grove formed part of a forest track extending up to the Himálaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He was a brother of Vijayabáhu I., who made him ádipáda and gave him Rohana (Cv.lix.12). He married his step-sister Sumittá (Cv.lix.43) and was later made uparája (Cv.lx.87). On the death of Vijayabáhu, Jayabáhu became king with the help of the Pándyan faction of the royal family and appointed, &quot;contrary to former custom,&quot; Mánábharana as his uparája. The latter, however, seems to have been the virtual king; his attempts to attack Vikkamabáhu, the lawful uparája, ended in disaster, and Vikkamabáhu captured the capital, Pulatthipura, whereupon Jayabáhu retired to Rohana. He lived there as nominal sovereign and died in obscurity (Cv.lxi).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Jayabáhu.-A Tamil usurper who, with Mágha, seems to have been in possession of the north of Ceylon and the capital at Pulatthipura for many years, both before and during the reign of Parakkamabáhu II. Cv.lxxxii.87; lxxxiii.15ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Jayabáhu.-Youngest of the five sons of Parakkamabáhu II. He lived with his father and helped in the administration. Cv.lxxxvii.17; lxxxviii.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Jayabáhu.-Grandson of Parakkamabáhu VI., whom he is said to have succeeded, but nothing further is known of him except that he was murdered by Bhuvanekabáhu (vi.). Cv.xcii.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Jayabáhu.-A thera of Ceylon, better known as Devarakkhita or Dhammakitti. He was Sangharája and composed the Nikáyasangraha.

Supposing the fairest maiden in all the countryside were to dance and sing in public, and a man were told that if he carried a bowl brimful of oil through the crowd he would win the maiden, but that if he spilt one single drop he would lose his head, that man would not turn his attention to anything else or grow slack in his efforts. In the same way should monks cultivate mindfulness relating to the body (S.v.169f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta seems also to have been called the Janapadakalyáni Sutta. E.g., J.i.393f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

The king of Benares, seeing him, took a great fancy to him and did him honour, desiring his friendship. When the king went to Anotatta, the Bodhisatta did him similar honour and friendship was established between them. One day, two of the young geese, in spite of the advice of the Bodhisatta, wished to try their speed against the sun. Their king, wishing to save them from death, went with them, rescuing them when tired. Then he himself raced the sun and was victorious, arriving at the king's palace. The king, hearing of this, wished to see an exhibition of the Bodhisatta's powers of speed, and his desire was granted. When asked whether anything was fleeter than himself, the king of the geese replied that the decay of the elements of life was a thousand-fold speedier. He thereupon preached the moral law to the king. Ananda is identified with the king and Sáriputta and Moggallána with the two geese. J.iv.211-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Jenta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Jenta.-A village in Magadha, the birthplace of Jenta Thera. ThagA.i.219.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Jenta.-A thera. He was born in the village of Jenta as the son of a chieftain. He was thoughtful when young, and one day, having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and soon became an arahant (Thag.vs.111; ThagA.i.219f). He was a devaputta in the time of Sikhí Buddha and offered him kinkiráta-flowers. Five kappas ago he was a king named Sattuttama. v.l. Sabbuttama. He is probably identical with Kakkárapupphiya of the Apadána (Ap.i.177).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Jenta Purohitaputta.-A thera. He was the son of the chaplain of the Kosala king. (Was he Angulimála's brother? See Angulimála). He was intoxicated with pride over his own advantages, and one day, though visiting the Buddha, he decided not to speak unless the Buddha should address him first. The Buddha, reading his thoughts, preached a sermon, intended for him, on the evils of pride, and Jenta became a Sotápanna. Later he entered the Order and became an arahant (Thag.vs.423-8; ThagA.i.455f). Perhaps he is to be identified with Manàtthaddha of the Samyutta Nikáya (S.i.177; KS.i.224, n.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Jetavana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Jetavana.&lt;/b&gt;-A park in Sávatthi, in which was built the Anáthapindikáráma. When the Buddha accepted Anáthapindika's invitation to visit Sávatthi the latter, seeking a suitable place for the Buddha's residence, discovered this park belonging to Jetakumára (MA.i.471 says it was in the south of Sávatthi). When he asked to be allowed to buy it, Jeta's reply was: &quot;Not even if you could cover the whole place with money.&quot; Anáthapindika said that he would buy it at that price, and when Jeta answered that he had had no intention of making a bargain, the matter was taken before the Lords of Justice, who decided that if the price mentioned were paid, Anáthapindika had the right of purchase. Anáthapindika had gold brought down in carts and covered Jetavana with pieces laid side by side. (This incident is illustrated in a bas-relief at the Bharhut Tope; see Cunningham - the Stúpa of Bharhut, Pl.lvii., pp.84-6). The money brought in the first journey was found insufficient to cover one small spot near the gateway. So Anáthapindika sent his servants back for more, but Jeta, inspired by Anáthapindika's earnestness, asked to be allowed to give this spot. Anáthapindika agreed and Jeta erected there a gateway, with a room over it. Anáthapindika built in the grounds dwelling rooms, retiring rooms, store rooms and service halls, halls with fireplaces, closets, cloisters, halls for exercise, wells, bathrooms, ponds, open and roofed sheds, etc. (Vin.ii.158f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MA.i.50; UdA.56f) that Anáthapindika paid eighteen crores for the purchase of the site, all of which Jeta spent in the construction of the gateway gifted by him. (The gateway was evidently an imposing structure; see J.ii.216).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeta gave, besides, many valuable trees </data>
<data>for timber. Anáthapindika himself spent fifty-four crores in connection with the purchase of the park and the buildings erected in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ceremony of dedication was one of great splendour. Not only Anáthapindika himself, but his whole family took part: his son with five hundred other youths, his wife with five hundred other noble women, and his daughters Mahá Subhaddá and Cúla Subhaddá with five hundred other maidens. Anáthapindika was attended by five hundred bankers. The festivities in connection with the dedication lasted for nine months (J.i.92ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the chief buildings attached to the Jetavana are mentioned in the books by special names, viz., Mahágandhakuti, Kaverimandalamála, Kosambakuti and Candanamála. SNA.ii.403. Other buildings are also mentioned - e.g., the Ambalakotthaka-ásanasálá (J.ii.246). According to Tibetan sources the vihára was built according to a plan sent by the devas of Tusita and contained sixty large halls and sixty small. The Dulva also gives details of the decorative scheme of the vihára (Rockhill: op. cit.48 and n.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these were built by Anáthapindika; there was another large building erected by Pasenadi and called the Salalaghara (DA.ii.407). Over the gateway lived a guardian deity to prevent all evildoers from entering (SA.i.239). Just outside the monastery was a rájayatana-tree, the residence of the god Samiddhisumana (Mhv.i.52f; MT 105; but see DhA.i.41, where the guardian of the gateway is called Sumana).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the grounds there seems to have been a large pond which came to be called the Jetavanapokkharaní. (AA.i.264; here the Buddha often bathed (J.i.329ff.). Is this the Pubbakotthaka referred to at A.iii.345? But see S.v.220; it was near this pond that Devadatta was swallowed up in Avíci (J.iv.158)). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grounds themselves were thickly </data>
<data>covered with trees, giving the appearance of a wooded grove (arañña) (Sp.iii.532). On the outskirts of the monastery was a mango-grove (J.iii.137). In front of the gateway was the Bodhi-tree planted by Anáthapindika, which came later to be called the Anandabodhi (q.v.) (J.iv.228f). Not far from the gateway was a cave which became famous as the Kapallapúvapabbhára on account of an incident connected with Macchariya-Kosiya (J.i.348).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near Jetavana was evidently a monastery of the heretics where Ciñcámánaviká spent her nights while hatching her conspiracy against the Buddha. (DhA.iii.179; behind Jetavana was a spot where the Ajivakas practised their austerities (J.i.493). Once the heretics bribed Pasenadi to let them make a rival settlement behind Jetavana, but the Buddha frustrated their plans (J.ii.170)). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been a playground just outside Jetavana used by the children of the neighbourhood, who, when thirsty, would go into Jetavana to drink (DhA.iii.492). The high road to Sávatthi passed by the edge of Jetavana, and travellers would enter the park to rest and refresh themselves (J.ii.203, 341; see also vi.70, where two roads are mentioned). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Divyávadána (Dvy.395f), the thúpas of Sáriputta and Moggallána were in the grounds of Jetavana and existed until the time of Asoka. Both Fa Hien (Giles: p.33ff) and Houien Thsang (Beal.ii.7ff) give descriptions of other incidents connected with the Buddha, which took place in the neighbourhood of Jetavana - e.g., the murder of Sundariká, the calumny of Ciñcá, Devadatta's attempt to poison the Buddha, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space covered by the four bedposts of the Buddha's Gandhakuti in Jetavana is one of the four avijahitatthánáni; all Buddhas possess the same, though the size of the actual vihára differs in the case of the various Buddhas. For Vipassí Buddha, the setthi Punabbasumitta built </data>
<data>a monastery extending for a whole league, while for Sikhí, the setthi Sirivaddha made one covering three gavutas. The Sangháráma built by Sotthiya for Vessabhú was half a league in extent, while that erected by Accuta for Kakusandha covered only one gávuta. Konagamana's monastery, built by the setthi Ugga, extended for half a gávuta, while Kassapa's built by Sumangala covered sixteen karísas. Anáthapindika's monastery covered a space of eighteen karísas (BuA.2, 47; J.i.94; DA.ii.424).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent nineteen rainy seasons in Jetavana (DhA.i.3; BuA.3; AA.i.314). It is said that after the Migáramátupásáda came into being, the Buddha would dwell alternately in Jetavana and Migáramátupásáda, often spending the day in one and the night in the other (SNA.i.336).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a description given by Fa Hien (Giles, pp.31, 33), the vihára was originally in seven sections (storeys?) and was filled with all kinds of offerings, embroidered banners, canopies, etc., and the lamps burnt from dusk to dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day a rat, holding in its mouth a lamp wick, set fire to the banners and canopies, and all the seven sections were entirely destroyed. The vihára was later rebuilt in two sections. There were two main entrances, one on the east, one on the west, and Fa Hsien found thúpas erected at all the places connected with the Buddha, each with its name inscribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vihára is almost always referred to as Jetavane Anáthapindikassa Áráma. The Commentaries (MA.ii.50; UdA.56f, etc.) say that this was deliberate (at the Buddha's own suggestion pp.81-131; Beal: op. cit., ii.5 and Rockhill: p.49), in order that the names of both earlier and later owners might be recorded and that people might be reminded of two men, both very generous in the cause of the Religion, so that others might follow their example. The vihára is sometimes referred to as Jetáráma (E.g., Ap.i.400).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;In the district of Saheth-Mabeth, with which the region of Sávatthi is identified, Saheth is considered to be Jetavana (Arch. Survey of India, 1907-8, pp.81-131).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Jetavana.&lt;/b&gt;-A monastery in Anurádhapura, situated in the Jotivana (q.v.) and founded by Mahásena at the instigation of a monk named Tissa of the Dakkhináráma. The monks of the Mahávihára protested against this and Jetavana was later given to them (Mhv.xxxvii.32ff). Attached to the vihára is a large thúpa. The work was completed by Sirimeghavanna (Cv.xxxvii.65). Dáthàpabhuti held in the vihára the ceremony in honour of the Dhammadhátu (Cv.xli.40; also Cv.Trs.i.55, n.2), while Mahánága gave to it the village of Vasabha in Uddhagáma and three hundred fields, to ensure a permanent supply of rice gruel to the monks (Cv.xli.97f). Aggabodhi II. crowned the thúpa with a lightning conductor (cumbata) (Cv.xlii.66), Jetthatissa I. gave for its maintenance the village of Gondigáma (Cv.xliv.97), and Aggabodhi III. bestowed on it the Mahámanikagáma (Cv.xliv.121). Potthasáta, senápati of Aggabodhi IV., built in the vihára the Aggabodhi-parivena (Cv.xlvi.22), and Aggabodhi IX. made a golden image to be placed in the shrine-room (Cv.xlix.77).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sena I. erected in the monastery grounds a mansion of several storeys (Cv., l.65). Kassapa V. gave a village for the maintenance of the refectory (Cv.lii.59), while four officials of Mahinda IV. built four parivenas attached to the vihára (Cv.liv.49).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monks of Jetavana, though nominally forming part of the Mahávihára fraternity, held divergent views in regard to the teachings of the Buddha, and were considered as a separate sect (the Ságaliyas) till Parakkamabáhu 1. united all the fraternities (Cv.lxxviii.22).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thúpa at Jetavana was restored by </data>
<data>Parakkamabáhu I. to a height of two hundred and ten feet (Cv.lxxviii.98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Jetavana.&lt;/b&gt;-A monastery in Pulatthipura, built by Parakkamabáhu I. It included the building which housed the Tivanka image (Cv.lxxviii.32, 47). The Nammadá Canal flowed through the grounds of Jetavana. Ibid., lxxix.48.

Jará Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Once, when the Buddha was on a visit to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saketa')"&gt;Sáketa&lt;/a&gt;, a rich brahmin and his wife, seeing him, called him their son and ministered to him with great affection. It is said that for five hundred births they had been the parents of the Bodhisatta. At the conclusion of a meal the Buddha preached to them and they became Sotápannas. After the Buddha left Sáketa they continued to lead pious lives and became arahants before death. At their funeral they were accorded all the honours due to arahants, and at the conclusion of the ceremonies the Buddha, who was present, preached this sutta to those assembled there (SNA.ii.531ff; DhA.iii.317ff; cp. - &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saketa_jat_068_237')"&gt;Sáketa Játaka&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From selfishness come grief and avarice. The monk who lives away from the world, un-smeared by it, is independent and becomes purified. SN.804-813 explained at MNid.i.117ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

He was the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/salavati')"&gt;Sálavatí&lt;/a&gt;, a courtesan of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt;. (AA. (i.216) says that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhaya')"&gt;Abhayarájakumára&lt;/a&gt; was his father). Directly after birth the child was placed in a basket and thrown on a dust-heap, from where he was rescued by Abhayaràjakumára. When questioned by Abhaya, people said &quot;he was alive&quot; (jívati), and therefore the child was called Jívaka; because he was brought up by the prince (kumárena posápito), he was called Komárabhacca. It has been suggested, however, that Komárabhacca meant master of the Kaumárabhrtya science (the treatment of infants); VT.ii.174; in Dvy. (506-18) he is called Kumárabhúta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When grown up, he learnt of his antecedents, and going to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa')"&gt;Takkasilá&lt;/a&gt; without Abhaya's knowledge, studied medicine for seven years. His teacher then gave him a little money and sent him away as being fit to practise medicine. His first patient was the setthi's wife at Sáketa, and for curing her he received sixteen thousand kahápanas, a manservant, a maid-servant and a coach with horses. When he returned to Rájagaha, Abhaya established him in his own residence. There he cured &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara')"&gt;Bimbisára&lt;/a&gt; of a troublesome fistula and received as reward all the ornaments of Bimbisára's five hundred wives. He was appointed physician to the king and the king's women and also to the fraternity of monks with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at its head. Other cures of Jívaka's included that of the setthi of Rájagaha on whom he performed the operation of </data>
<data>trepanning, and of the son of the setthi of Benares who had suffered from chronic intestinal trouble due to misplacement, and for this case Jívaka received sixteen thousand kahápanas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cannda_ppajjota')"&gt;Candappajjota&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;, was ill, Bimbisára lent Jívaka to him. Candappajjota hated ghee, which was, however, the only remedy. Jívaka prepared the medicine, prescribed it for the king, then rode away on the king's elephant Bhaddavatiká before the king discovered the nature of the medicine. Pajjota, in a rage, ordered his capture and sent his slave Káka after him. Káka discovered Jívaka breakfasting at Kosambí and allowed himself to be persuaded to eat half a myrobalan, which purged him violently. Jívaka explained to Káka that he wished to delay his return; he told him why he had fled from the court and, having returned the elephant, proceeded to Rájagaha. Pajjota was cured and, as a token of his favour, sent Jívaka a suit of Síveyyaka cloth, which Jívaka presented to the Buddha (Vin.i.268-81; AA.i.216). Jívaka was greatly attracted by the Buddha. Once when the Buddha was ill, Jívaka found it necessary to administer a purge, and he had fat rubbed into the Buddha's body and gave him a handful of lotuses to smell. Jívaka was away when the purgative acted, and suddenly remembered that he had omitted to ask the Buddha to bathe in warm water to complete the cure. The Buddha read his thoughts and bathed as required. Vin.i.279f; DhA. (ii.164f), relates a like occurrence in another connection. When the Buddha's foot was injured by the splinter from the rock hurled by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;, he had to be carried from&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maddakucci')"&gt;Maddakucchi&lt;/a&gt; to Jívaka's Ambavana. There Jívaka applied an astringent, and having bandaged the wound, </data>
<data>left the city expecting to return in time to remove it. But by the time he did return, the city gates were closed and he could not enter. He was greatly worried because he knew that if the bandage remained on all night the Buddha would suffer intense pain. But the Buddha read his thoughts and removed the bandage. See also J.v.333.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Jívaka became a Sotápanna, he was anxious to visit the Buddha twice a day, and finding &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt; too far away, he built a monastery with all its adjuncts in his own Ambavana in Rájagaha, which he gave to the Buddha and his monks (DA.i.133; MA.ii.590). When Bimbisára died, Jívaka continued to serve Ajátasattu, and was responsible for bringing him to the Buddha after his crime of parricide. (For details see the Sámaññaphala Sutta; also J.i.508f; v.262, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jívaka's fame as a physician brought him more work than he could cope with, but he never neglected his duties to the Sangha. Many people, afflicted with disease and unable to pay for treatment by him, joined the Order in order that they might receive that treatment. On discovering that the Order was thus being made a convenience of, he asked the Buddha to lay down a rule that men afflicted with certain diseases should be refused entry into the Order (Vin.i.71ff). Jívaka was declared by the Buddha chief among his lay followers loved by the people (aggam puggalappasannánam) (A.i.26). He is included in a list of good men who have been assured of the realisation of deathlessness (A.iii.451; DhA.i.244, 247; J.i.116f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a meal once given by Jívaka, the Buddha refused to be served until Cúlapanthaka, who had been left out of the invitation, had been sent for. (For details see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_panthaka_th')"&gt;Cúlapanthaka&lt;/a&gt;). It may have been the preaching of the &lt;a href="jiivaka_s')"&gt;Jívaka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; which effected Jívaka's conversion. One </data>
<data>discussion he had with the Buddha regarding the qualities of a pious lay disciple is recorded in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.iv.222f). &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sirimaa')"&gt;Sirimá&lt;/a&gt; was Jívaka's youngest sister (SNA.i.244; DhA.iii.106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Jívaka's request, the Buddha enjoined upon monks to take exercise; Jívaka had gone to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali')"&gt;Vesáli&lt;/a&gt; on business and had noticed their pale, unhealthy took (Vin.ii.119).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Jambáli Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some monks attain to release of mind, but when they apply themselves to the ending of sakkáya their minds do not settle down, do not stay fixed; they are like a man who grasps a branch with his hand smeared with resin. In the case of other monks, their minds abide in the release attained and stay fixed in the endeavour to destroy sakkáya - and they are like a man who grasps a branch with a clean hand. Some monks strive to destroy ignorance but are unsuccessful. Their minds are like a village pond (jambálí) which has stood for countless years with all its inlets blocked and outlets open and receiving no rain. There will be no breach in its dyke. There are other monks who break through ignorance by application of the mind - like a village pond with all its inlets open and outlets closed and with rain falling continuously into it.

Because of her very great beauty she earned the sobriquet of Janapadakalyání. The Udána Commentary (170) gives details of her beauty, which justified her title; see also J.i.394. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janapadakalyání was engaged to be married to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, but on the day fixed for the marriage the Buddha induced Nanda to join the Order, in spite of Nanda's wishes, and in due course he became an arahant. Later, when women were admitted to the Order, Janapadakalyání, feeling she had nothing to look forward to, became a Bhikkhuní under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami')"&gt;Pajápatí&lt;/a&gt;. For a long time she would not visit the Buddha, having heard that he spoke disparagingly of physical beauty, but one day, inspired by curiosity, she accompanied her colleagues to hear the Buddha preach. He, being aware of her thoughts, created the form of a most beautiful maiden who stood fanning him. As Janapadakalyání sat gazing at her, enraptured by her beauty, she saw her gradually reach extreme old age, passing through all the stages, until at last she saw her die, leaving her body to decompose and become a mass of filth. At the critical moment, the Buddha uttered the appropriate words and Janapadakalyání became a Sotápanna. The Buddha then preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/k3_kay')"&gt;Káyavicchandanika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and she became an arahant (Ud.iii.2; J.i.91; SNA.i.241f, 243f, 254, 273; DhA.i.97, 100).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She seems to have been known also as Rúpanandá. DhA.iii.113f; but see Rúpanandá; perhaps here we have a confusion of </data>
<data>legends. In the northern books she is called Bhadrá. (Rockhill, p.55.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of her previous lives, Janapadakalyání was born as a she-mule; she sorely tempted Nanda, who was then a mule belonging to a merchant named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kappata')"&gt;Kappata&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.105).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sundari_nandaa')"&gt;Sundari Nandá&lt;/a&gt; also seems to have been called Janapadakalyání.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

His servant was Gámanicanda. For their story see the Gamanicanda Játaka (J.ii.297ff ); Janasandha is also referred to as Dasaratha (E.g., p.299).

The Jívaka Suttas, mentioned above, were also preached there. The mango-grove was near Maddakucchi, so thither they carried the Buddha when his foot was injured by a splinter from the rock hurled by Devadatta (DhA.ii.164, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in this grove that Cúlapanthaka attained arahantship, and, at that time, there were five hundred monks there (J.i.114f., etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuns, too, appear to have gone there for their siesta.

Jotipála.&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta born as the son of the chaplain of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He was a great archer and became an ascetic. He is also referred to as Sarabhanga (J.v.127ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his story see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhanga_jat_522')"&gt;Sarabhanga Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. He is evidently identical with Jotipála of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/indriya_jat_423')"&gt;Indriya Játaka&lt;/a&gt;. He belonged to the Kondaññagotta. J.v.140, 141, 142.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Jotipála.&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta born as a brahmin of Vehalinga in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddha.&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghatiikaara')"&gt;Ghatíkára&lt;/a&gt; was his friend and invited Jotipála to accompany him to the Buddha, but Jotipála refused to go, saying that a &quot;shaveling recluse&quot; could be of no use to him. But Ghatíkára was very insistent, and one day, after they had bathed together in the river, seized Jotipála by the hair and made a final appeal. This boldness on the part of an inferior (Ghatíkára was a potter) caused Jotipála to realise his extreme earnestness and he agreed to go. After hearing the Buddha preach, Jotipála became a monk (M.ii.46ff; J.i.43; Bu.xxv.10; see also S.i.34f; Mil.221; Mtu.i.319ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This insulting remark made by Jotipála regarding Kassapa Buddha led to Gotama, in his last life, having to practise austerities for a longer period than did the other Buddhas (Ap.i.301; UdA.265; ApA.i.95). The memory of what he did as Jotipála was one of the things that made the Buddha smile. DhsA.294, 496.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Jotipála.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin, son of Govinda, chaplain of Disampati. Jotipála was a friend of Disampati's son, Renu, who had </data>
<data>six other nobles as companions. On the death of Govinda, Jotipála became chaplain to Disampati. He inspired Renu's six companions to wait on Renu and make him promise to share the kingdom with them when he should come to the throne. This promise Renu kept when he succeeded his father and appointed Jotipála to carry out the division of the kingdom, which the latter duly did. All the kings wished Jotipála to be their chaplain, and he instructed them in the art of government, teaching the mantras also to seven eminent brahmins and to seven hundred young graduates. Jotipála himself came to be known as Mahá Govinda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some time, Jotipála took leave of the seven kings, his disciples and his wives, and spent the four months of the rainy season in a retired spot outside the city, developing jhána in order to see Brahmá face to face. At the end of the four months, Brahmá Sanankumára appeared before him and gave him a boon. Jotipála asked to be taught the way to reach the Brahma-world, and, having listened to Sanankumára's exposition, decided to leave the world. The kings and all the others did their best to make him desist from this course, but finding their efforts of no avail they went with him into the homeless life, where all of them profited thereby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jotipála was the Bodhisatta (D.ii.232-51; Mtu.i.197ff). He is twice mentioned in the Anguttara Nikáya (A.iii.372; iv.135; AA.ii.679) in a list of ancient teachers with very large followings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Jotipála.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk at whose request Buddhaghosa wrote the Sáratthappakásiní and the Manoratthapúraní.

Later the Kálinga king came with his family to Ceylon and was ordained under Jotipála. Aggabodhi II. repaired the Thúpáráma at Jotipála's suggestion and deposited therein a relic of the Buddha from the Lohapásáda (Cv.xlii.35, 45, 51, 60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Here also arrived the ship conveying &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanghamitta_theri')"&gt;Sanghamittá&lt;/a&gt; and the branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree, welcomed by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devaanampiyatissa')"&gt;Devánampiyatissa&lt;/a&gt;, who awaited her arrival in the Samuddapannasálá (Mhv.xix.25f). A sapling from the Bodhi-tree was afterwards planted on the spot where it had stood after landing (Mhv.vs.59; Sp.i.100; Mbv.145-62, passim) and Devánampiyatissa built a vihára there called the Jambukolavihára (Mhv.xx.25). From Jambukola to Támalitti by sea was a seven days' voyage (Mhv.xi.23), and it appears to have taken five days to get to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura')"&gt;Anurádhapura&lt;/a&gt; from Jambukola (Mhv.vs.38).

He was given a young maiden in repayment of a debt, but because she was praised for her virtues, the other wives in the village grew jealous of her and mocked her as an old man's darling. Thereafter she refused to go to the village well, and suggested that Jújaka should obtain as slaves the children of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara')"&gt;Vessantara&lt;/a&gt;, then living as an ascetic in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vankagiri')"&gt;Vankagiri&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many adventures Jújaka found Vessantara, was allowed to have the two children, Jáli and Kanhajiná, and having tied their hands together, took them away. After he had travelled sixty leagues, the gods led him to Jetuttara, where the children's grandfather reigned as king. The king bought the children back from Jújaka at a very great price and gave him choice foods to eat. Jújaka, having over-eaten and being unable to digest the food, died on the spot (J.vi.521-81).

The sprite drove them both away as being liars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a report that Devadatta and Kokálika were going about singing each other's praises.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Jáliya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paribbájaka who, with his friend Mandissa, visited the Buddha at the Ghositáráma (D.i.159). The Buddha preached to them the Jáliya Sutta (q.v.). According to the Pátika Sutta, when Jáliya heard that Pátika could not come to hold a discussion with the Buddha at Vesáli, he went to the Tindukkhána-paribbájakáráma and tried to get Pátikaputta to come. But the latter was unable to come, being fixed in his seat. Jáliya thereupon spoke insultingly to him, calling him boaster, etc. (D.iii.22ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jáliya is described as dárupattakantevásí, because, says the Commentary (DA.i.319), his teacher used to beg for alms with a wooden bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Jinna Sutta.-Two very old brahmins visit the Buddha and ask him for a teaching to cheer and comfort them. He tells them to practise self-restraint in all things. A.i.155.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Jinna Sutta.-Similar to the above. The Buddha tells them that the whole world is being burned by old age and death and that only what is saved will be useful. Meritorious deeds brings happiness after death. A.i.156.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Jinna Sutta.-Mahá Kassapa visits the Buddha at Rájagaha. The Buddha suggests that now that he is very old he should give up wearing cast-off rag robes and dwelling in the forest, and should enjoy the gifts given to him by householders. Kassapa refuses to give up his long-established austere habits of life. Being asked the reason for this method of life, Kassapa answers that it is for his own happiness and out of compassion for those that come after (S.ii.202). The Commentary (SA.ii.128) adds that the Buddha asked the question in order to give Kassapa an opportunity for his &quot;lion's roar&quot; (Kassapa-síhanáda).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Jambuka Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-He was born in Rájagaha of rich parents but from infancy he would eat nothing but excrement. When he grew older he was ordained with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aajiivakaa')"&gt;Ájívakas&lt;/a&gt;, who pulled out his hair with a palmyra comb. When the Ajivakas discovered that he ate filth, they expelled him and he lived as a naked ascetic, practising all kinds of austerities and accepting no offerings save butter and honey placed on the tip of his tongue with the point of a blade of grass. His fame spread far. When he was fifty-five years old, the Buddha visited him and spent the night in a cave near his abode. During the night, Jambuka saw mighty gods come to pay homage to the Buddha and was so impressed that the next day he sought the Buddha's counsel. The Buddha told him of his past evil deeds which had condemned him to practise austerities for so long and counselled him to give up his evil ways. In the course of the sermon, Jambuka grew ashamed of his nakedness and the Buddha gave him a bath-robe. At the end of the discourse Jambuka became an arahant, and when the inhabitants of Anga and Magadha came to him with their offerings, he performed a miracle before them and paid homage to the Buddha, acknowledging him as his teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jambuka was a monk and had a lay patron who looked after him. One day a pious monk came to his vihára, and the layman, being pleased with him, showed him much attention. The resident monk, very jealous, reviled the visitor, saying, &quot;It would be better for you to eat filth than food in this layman's house, to tear your hair with a palmyra comb than let his barber cut it for you, to go naked than wear robes given by him, to lie on the ground than on a bed provided by </data>
<data>him.&quot; The Elder, not wishing to be the cause of his sinning, left the monastery the next day. Because of this act, the meditations practised by Jambuka for twenty thousand years were of no avail, and he was born in Avíci, where he suffered torments during an interval between two Buddhas. In this last life, too, he was condemned to suffer in many ways, as related above (DhA.ii.52-63; Thag.283-6; ThagA.i.386f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha he was a householder and made offerings at the Buddha's Bodhi-tree, fanning the Buddha's seat with a fan. He is probably identical with Síhásanavíjaníya of the Apadána (Ap.ii.403).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mil.350; AA.i.57) that when the Buddha preached to Jambuka, eighty-four thousand others realised the Truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Jambuka.&lt;/b&gt;-A parrot, an incarnation of the Bodhisatta, adopted as his son by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmadatta')"&gt;Brahmadatta&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares. He preached to the king on the fivefold power - of limbs, of wealth, of counsel, of caste and of wisdom - the last being the best. The king thereupon appointed him commander-in-chief. J.v.111, 120, 125.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Jambuka.&lt;/b&gt;-A dog, companion of the she-goat in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/putimamsa_jat_437')"&gt;Pútimamsa Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.

In a wood they came across a disused well and, needing water, dug it deeper. There they came across buried treasure, but the men, not being satisfied, dug deeper, in spite of the Bodhisatta's warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nága-king who lived there was disturbed and slew all except the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to some arahants of Sávatthi, who, on their way back from there, after having entertained the Buddha, saw the same well and found treasure there. They, however, were satisfied with their find and reported it to the Buddha (J.ii.294f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Three kappas ago he became king thirty-four times under the name of Supáricariya (Ap.i.154).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Samitigutta.

Later, he saw the lion eating the carcase of a buffalo and asked for a boon. The lion refused, saying it was enough for him to have escaped death after putting his head into a lion's jaws. The lion is identified with Devadatta, and the story was related in reference to his ingratitude. J.iii.25-7; cp. Játakamála No.xxxiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

One day, seeing Mahá Kassapa going for alms, he entertained the Elder and requested him to preach. On a hill near the village Jotidása built a vihára for Kassapa and provided him with the requisites. Moved by the Elder's teaching, he left the world and soon after became an arahant. After ten years - during which he learnt the Three Pitakas, being specially proficient in the Vinaya - while on his way to Sávatthi to see the Buddha, he entered a Paribbájakáráma, and there had a discussion with the Paribbájakas on how to burn away evil. At the end of the discussion, they were ordained under him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhí Buddha he was a householder and, seeing the Buddha, offered him a kásumárika-fruit (Thag.143-4; ThagA.i.264f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Kásumáraphaladáyaka of the Apadána ii.445.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Játaka&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tenth book of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khuddaka_n')"&gt;Khuddaka Nikáya&lt;/a&gt; of the Sutta Pitaka containing tales of the former births of the Buddha. The Játaka also forms one of the nine angas or divisions of the Buddha's teachings, grouped according to the subject matter (DA.i.15, 24). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The canonical book of the Játakas (so far unpublished) contains only the verses, but it is almost certain that from the first there must have been handed down an oral commentary giving the stories in prose. This commentary later developed into the &lt;a href="jaatakatthakathaa')"&gt;Játakatthakathá&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the Játakas have been included in a separate compilation, called the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cariyaapitaka')"&gt;Cariyá Pitaka&lt;/a&gt;. It is not possible to say when the Játakas in their present form came into existence nor how many of these were among the original number. In the time of the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niddesa')"&gt;Culla Niddesa&lt;/a&gt;, there seem to have been five hundred Játakas, because reference is made to pañcajátakasatáni (p.80; five hundred was the number seen by Fa Hsien in Ceylon (p.71)). Bas-reliefs of the third century have been found illustrating a number of Játaka stories, and they presuppose the existence of a prose collection. Several Játakas exist in the canonical books which are not included in the Játaka collection. For a discussion on the Játakas in all their aspects, see Rhys Davids Buddhist India, pp.189ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighabhaanakaa')"&gt;Díghabhánakas&lt;/a&gt; included the Játaka in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhidhamma_pitaka')"&gt;Abhidhamma Pitaka&lt;/a&gt;.

It comprises all the verses of the &lt;a href="jaataka')"&gt;Játaka&lt;/a&gt; and gives also, in prose, the stories connected with the verses. Each such story is given a framework of introductory episode, stating the circumstances in which the story was related, and each story has at the end an identification of the chief characters mentioned with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; and his contemporaries in some previous birth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole collection is prefaced by a long introductory essay, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nidanakatha')"&gt;Nidánakathá&lt;/a&gt;, giving the Buddha's history before his birth as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siddhattha')"&gt;Siddhattha&lt;/a&gt;, and also during his last birth, up to the time of the Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is a translation into Páli of the commentary in Sinhalese as handed down in Ceylon, but the verses of this commentary were already in Páli.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authorship of the translation is traditionally attributed to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt;, but there exists much difference of opinion on this point.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the four Mahádípas, or great continents, which are included in the Cakkavála and are ruled by a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakkavatti&lt;/a&gt;. They are grouped round Mount&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sineru')"&gt;Sineru&lt;/a&gt;. In Jambudípa is &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava')"&gt;Himavá&lt;/a&gt; with its eighty-four thousand peaks, its lakes, mountain ranges, etc. This continent derives its name from the Jambu-tree (also called Naga) which grows there, its trunk fifteen yojanas in girth, its outspreading branches fifty yojanas in length, its shade one hundred yojanas in extent and its height one hundred yojanas (Vin.i.30; SNA.ii.443; Vsm.i.205f; Sp.i.119, etc.). On account of this tree, Jambudípa is also known as Jambusanda (SN.vs.552; SNA.i.121). The continent is ten thousand yojanas in extent; of these ten thousand, four thousand are covered by the ocean, three thousand by the Himálaya mountains, while three thousand are inhabited by men (SNA.ii.437; UdA.300).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in Jambudípa there are as many as eighty-four thousand cities; this number is sometimes reduced to sixty thousand, forty thousand, or even twenty thousand, but never to less (SNA.i.59; J.iv.84 says sixty-three thousand; PvA.111). In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka')"&gt;Asoka&lt;/a&gt; there were eighty-four thousand cities, in each of which he built a monastery (Mhv.v.176; Vsm.201). In the Anguttara Nikáya (i.35) it is said that, in Jambudípa, trifling in number are the parks, groves, lakes, etc., more numerous the steep, precipitous places, unfordable rivers, inaccessible mountains, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metteyya')"&gt;Metteyya&lt;/a&gt; Buddha's appearance on earth Jambudípa will be pervaded by mankind even as a jungle is by </data>
<data>reeds and rushes. There will be eighty-four thousand cities with Ketumátí (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;) at the head (D.iii.75).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha once declared that the people of Jambudípa excel those of both &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarakuru')"&gt;Uttarakuru&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa')"&gt;Távatimsa&lt;/a&gt; in three respects - courage, mindfulness and religious life (A.iv.396; Kvu.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhas (and Cakkavattis) are born only in Jambudípa (BuA.48; MA.ii.917).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were four sounds heard throughout Jambudípa:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the shout uttered by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaka')"&gt;Punnaka&lt;/a&gt; proclaiming his victory over   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhananjaya')"&gt;Dhanañjaya Koravya&lt;/a&gt; in a game of dice; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the bark of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vissakamma')"&gt;Vissakamma&lt;/a&gt; when taken about in the guise of a dog by Sakka, threatening to devour all wicked beings after the decay of Kassapa's sásana; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the roar of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusa')"&gt;Kusa&lt;/a&gt;, challenging to battle the seven kings who sought the hand of Pabhávatí; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;the yell of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavaka')"&gt;Álavaka&lt;/a&gt;, proclaiming his name from the top of Kelása, on hearing that the Buddha had visited his abode (SA.i.248, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When opposed to Síhaladípa or Tambapannidípa, Jambudípa indicates the continent of India (E.g., Mhv.v.13; xiv.8; Cv.xxxvii.216, 246).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of cáriká, the monks divided their tours in Jambudípa into three circuits or mandalas - the Mahámandala which extended over nine hundred leagues, the Majjhima which extended over six hundred, and the Antima over three hundred. Those who wish to tour the first, start after the mahápavárana and complete their journey in nine </data>
<data>months, for the Majjhimamandala they start after the Pavárana, on the full-moon day of Kattika, completing the tour in nine months, while for the Antimamandala they start on the first day of Phussa and return after seven months (Sp.i.197).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each Cakkavála there is a Jambudípa (A.i.227). Mention is made in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaakaatii_jat_327')"&gt;Kákáti Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.91) of a Jambudípa-samudda, beyond which was the river Kebuka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He it was who predicted the glory of Asoka by explaining the prenatal desires of his mother. The queen promised him great honour if his predictions should prove true. Later, when Asoka became king and heard the story, he sent a golden palanquin to fetch Janasána to the palace. On the way, Janasána visited the Vattaniya hermitage where lived Assagutta, and having heard the latter talk of áyatana, his earlier kamma asserted itself and he became a monk, attaining arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a python who died while listening to some monks reciting a chapter on the áyatanas.

The lion agreed and provided him with food. On growing strong, the jackal offered to kill an elephant and, in spite of the lion's warnings, was trampled to death. The lion was the Bodhisatta and the jackal Devadatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta's attempt to imitate the Buddha.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Jeta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Jeta.-A prince. Owner of Jetavana, which he sold to Anáthapindika for eighteen crores. He then spent all that money on the erection of a gateway at the entrance, which he decorated with much grandeur (See Jetavana). Jeta is generally referred to as Jeta-Kumára. According to the northern records he was the son of Pasenadi by the Ksatriya princess Varsiká (Rockhill: 48, n.1). He was killed by his half-brother Vidudabha for refusing to help him in his slaughter of the Sákyans (Ibid., 121). Several explanations (MA.i.50; UdA.56; KhpA.111, etc.) are given of his name: he was so-called either (1) because he conquered his enemies, or (2) because he was born at a time when the king had overcome his enemies, or (3) because such a name was considered auspicious for him (mangalakámyatáya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

One day a tree-sprite appeared before him and asked him a riddle about waking and sleeping, which he solved to her satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a certain layman who was a Sotápanna. He was once travelling with a caravan along a forest road. When the caravan halted for the night it was attacked by robbers. But seeing the layman walking to and fro all night they stopped their attack and reported the matter to their leader. The layman was greatly honoured and, on arriving at Sávatthi, told the Buddha of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tree-sprite is identified with Uppalavanná (J.iii.403f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

He says he remembers fourteen lives in all. D.ii.205f, 207, 214; cp.

Jívaka Sutta.-Jívaka visits the Buddha who is staying in his Mangogrove, and asks if it is true that animals are slain expressly for the Buddha's use. The Buddha replies that he forbids the eating of meat only when there is evidence of one's eyes or ears as grounds for suspicion that the animal has been slain for one's express use. Anyone who slays an animal for the use of a monk and gives it to him commits a great evil. Jívaka is pleased with the reply and declares himself a follower of the Buddha. M.i.368f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Jívaka Sutta.-Questioned by Jívaka, the Buddha explains that an upásaka is one who has taken the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts, and that such a man, by reason of his qualities, works the welfare both of himself and others.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Jayaddisa Játaka (No.513)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twice the sons of Pañcála, king of Kampilla, were devoured by an ogress who had conceived a hatred for his queen. On the third occasion the ogress was chased by the palace guard before she could eat the child, but she succeeded in snatching him away and brought him up as her own. He grew up to be a man-eating ogre and dwelt in a tree. The fourth son of Pañcála was Jayaddisa, who succeeded his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ogress had died before his birth. He had a son Alínasattu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day Jayaddisa ordered a hunt, but just as he was about to start out, Nanda, a brahmin from Takkasilá, brought him four verses worth one hundred each. Jayaddisa ordered a dwelling to be made for him and declared that he on whose side the deer escaped should pay for the verses. An antelope made straight for the king and escaped. The king pursued and killed it, but while on his way back with the carcase he came to the ogre's dwelling place and was promptly claimed as his prey. Remembering his promise to pay Nanda, Jayaddisa persuaded the ogre to let him go on condition that he would return when he had paid for the verses. Alínasattu, hearing of this, offered to go in his father's place and this was allowed. He won over the ogre by his fearlessness, taught him the moral law and, suspecting that the ogre was his father's elder brother, proved the relationship with the help of an ascetic gifted with supernatural vision. Jayaddisa, informed of this, made a settlement for the ogre which came to be called Cullakammásadamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ogre was Angulimála and Alínasattu the Bodhisatta (J.v.21-30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who supported his mother; for details see the Sáma Játaka.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Jetthatissa &lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Jetthatissa I.-King of Ceylon (323-33 A.C.), elder son of Gothábhaya, the younger being Mahásena. He slew all the ministers who were disloyal to his father and earned the title of &quot;The Cruel.&quot; He rebuilt the Lohapásáda to a height of seven storeys and renamed it the Manipásáda, from the costly jewels he offered in it. He also built the Pácínatissapabbata-vihára and the Álambagáma tank. Mhv.xxxvi.118ff; Dpv.xxii.61, 66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Jetthatissa II.-King of Ceylon, brother (?) and successor of Sirimeghavanna. He ruled for nine years and was a very skilful carver in ivory. Cv.xxxvii.100-4; Cv. Trs.1.9, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Jetthatissa.-Son of King Sanghatissa. When Moggallána III. usurped the throne Jetthatissa fled to the Malaya country. From there he helped Asiggáhaka Silámeghavanna in his fight with Moggallána, but on discovering that Silámeghavanna wished to kill him also, he fled once more to Malaya. Later, he made his headquarters at Aritthapabbata, and from there led an army against Aggabodhi III., who was then on the throne. Aggabodhi fled to Jambudípa, and Jetthatissa became king as Jetthatissa III. He reigned for only five months, during which time he did several meritorious works. Aggabodhi returned with an army, and in the battle which followed Jetthatissa slew himself at the sight of his army suffering defeat. His queen entered the Order and became proficient in the Abhidhamma. Cv.xliv.28, 55, 61, 70, 86-106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Junha Játaka (No.456)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was born as Junha, son of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He studied in Takkasilá and, on one occasion, while walking in the dark, he ran up against a brahmin, knocking him down and breaking his bowl. Junha raised the brahmin to his feet and, on being asked for the price of a meal, told the brahmin who he was. He had no money with him, but requested the brahmin to remind him of the circumstance when he should become king. In due time Junha was anointed, and the brahmin stood one day by the road when the king was passing on his elephant. The brahmin stretched out his hand, crying, &quot;Victory to the king.&quot; Junha took no notice, so the brahmin uttered a stanza to the effect that a king should not neglect a brahmin's request. Junha then turned back, and the man explained who he was, asking Junha for five villages, one hundred slave girls, one thousand ornaments and two wives, all of which Junha gave him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the eight boons granted by the Buddha to Ananda when the latter became his constant attendant. Ananda is identified with the brahmin (J.iv.95-100). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanachanda_jat_289')"&gt;Nánacchanda Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

For his story see the Máluta Játaka (J.i.165f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Junha.-Son of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He was the Bodhisatta. See the Junha Játaka. J.iv.95ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Junha.-A minister of Pasenadi. When Pasenadi held his Asadisadána, Junha rejoiced in the king's generosity, but his friend Kála was displeased at what he considered as waste. The king, hearing of this from the Buddha, asked Junha to use the royal revenue to give alms on his own account during seven days. This Junha did. He became a Sotápanna after hearing the Buddha preach. DhA.iii.186ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Jayasena&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prince who once visited the novice &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aciravata')"&gt;Aciravata&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha')"&gt;Rájagaha&lt;/a&gt; and asked him to teach the Doctrine. Reluctantly the novice did so, but at the end of the exposition Jayasena declared that he was unable to agree with it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this was reported to the Buddha he said that Jayasena, being given up to luxury, could not be expected to appreciate renunciation (M.iii.128).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A discussion which Jayasena had with his uncle &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhuumija_th')"&gt;Bhúmiya Thera&lt;/a&gt; is recorded in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhumija_s')"&gt;Bhúmiya Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Álambáyana&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally the name of a spell taught to an ascetic by a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/garudaa')"&gt;Garuda&lt;/a&gt; king who had unwittingly torn up by its roots a banyan tree which grew at the end of the ascetic's walk. The ascetic taught it to a poor brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; who had gone into the forest to escape his creditors and who ministered to the ascetic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brahmin became known as Álambáyana after he learnt the spell. Having learnt it he left the forest and was walking along the banks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamunaa')"&gt;Yamuná&lt;/a&gt;, when he came across a host of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga')"&gt;Nágas&lt;/a&gt;, sitting, after their sports, round the Nága gem which grants all desires. The Nágas, hearing the man repeat the charm, fled in terror, believing him to be the Garuda, and he took possession of their jewel. Soon after, Álambáyana met an outcast brahmin with his son, Somadatta, and on their agreeing to show him the Nága King, Bhúridatta, he gave them the jewel.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of his spell Álambáyana tamed Bhúridatta and went about giving exhibitions of the Nága's skill. Bhúridatta was finally rescued by his brother Sudassana and his sister Accimukhí. In the contest of skill which Álambáyana had with Sudassana, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/accimukhii')"&gt;Accimukhí&lt;/a&gt; assumed the form of a frog and let drip three drops of poison on her brother's hand, and these were allowed to fall into a hole specially prepared and filled with cow-dung. A flame burst out and Álambáyana was smitten with the heat. His skin changed colour and he became a white leper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is told in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhuridatta_jat_543')"&gt;Bhúridatta Jataka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.179-97).&lt;/p&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Átuma Thera&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a setthi in Sávatthi. When he grew up his mother proposed to find him a wife, but on account of his upanissaya, he left the world and was ordained. His mother tried to entice him back but he declared his great determination and, developing insight, became an arahant (Thag.v.72; ThagA.i.160).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Vipassí's time he had been a householder and had made offering to Vipassí of perfumed water and fragrant powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-one kappas ago he was a king named Sugandha.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ájívaká&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of naked ascetics (see, e.g., Vin.i.291), followers of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makkhali_gosala')"&gt;Makkhali Gosála&lt;/a&gt;, regarded, from the Buddhist point of view, as the worst of sophists. Numerous references to the Ájívakas are to be found in the Pitakas, only a few of them being at all complimentary. Thus in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasaccaka_s')"&gt;Mahá Saccaka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (*) they are spoken of as going about naked, flouting life's decencies and licking their hands after meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*) M.i.238; see also S.i.66, where a   deva praises Gosála as a man who had attained to perfect self-control by   fasting and austere practices. He had abandoned speech and wordy strife with   any person, was equable, a speaker of truth, a doer of no evil. That the life   of the Ájívakas was austere may be gleaned from their condemnation of monks   carrying parasols (Viii.ii.130).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they never incurred the guilt &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;of obeying another man's command, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;of accepting food specially prepared for them, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;of accepting food from people while eating, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;from a pregnant woman, or nursing mother, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;or from gleanings in time of famine; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;they would never eat where a dog was already at hand, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;or where hungry flies were congregated. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They never touched flesh, fish or intoxicants, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and they had a rigid scale of food </data>
<data>rationing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is mentioned that they did not always find it possible to adhere to this rigid code of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is stated in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tevijja_vaccha_s')"&gt;Tevijja Vacchagotta Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.483) that far from any Ájívaka having put an end to sorrow, the Buddha could recall only one Ájívaka during ninety-nine kappas who had even gone to heaven, and that one too had preached a doctrine of kamma and the after-consequences of actions. Elsewhere (M.i.524) they are spoken of as children of a childless mother. They extol themselves and disparage others and yet they have produced only three shining lights:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda_vaccha')"&gt;Nanda Vaccha, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kisasankicca')"&gt;Kisa Sankicca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makkhali_gosala')"&gt;Makkhali Gosála&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fourth leader,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/panduputta')"&gt;Panduputta&lt;/a&gt;, of wagon-building stock, is mentioned in the Anangana Sutta (M.i.31); there is also the well-known &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka')"&gt;Upaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the Ájívaka were highly esteemed and had large followings of disciples (See, e.g., Pasenadi's evidence in S.i.68, apart from Ajátasattu's visit mentioned in the Sámaññaphala Sutta; also S.iv.398). They had eminent followers such as high court officials (Vin.ii.166; iv.71) and that, for centuries at least, they retained an important position, is shown by their being thrice mentioned in the Asoka Edicts as receiving royal gifts (Hultsch: Asoka Inscriptions, see Index).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctrines held by the Ájívaka are mentioned in several places, but the best known account is in the </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samannaphala_s')"&gt;Sámaññaphala Sutta&lt;/a&gt; where they are attributed to Makkhali Gosála by name (D.i.53-4. See also M.i.516f). He maintained that there is no cause or reason for either depravity or purity among beings. There is no such thing as intrinsic strength, or energy or human might or endeavour. All creatures, all beings, everything that has life, all are devoid of power, strength and energy; all are under the compulsion of the individual nature to which they are linked by destiny; it is solely by virtue of their birth in the six environments (chalabhijátiyo) that they experience their pleasure or pain. The universe is divided into various classes of beings, of occupations and methods of production. There are eighty-four hundred thousand periods during which both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, shall at last make an end of pain. The pleasures and pain, measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of transmigration; there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof, neither excess nor deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental point in their teaching seems, therefore, to have been &quot;samsára-suddhi,&quot; purification through transmigration, which probably meant that all beings, all lives, all existent things, all living substances attain and must attain, perfection in course of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; (DA.i.161), in the classification of the Ájívaka:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;all beings&quot; (sattá) meant all kinds of animals, camels, cows, asses, etc.;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;all lives&quot; (páná) comprised all sensitive things and sentient creatures divided into those with one sense (ekendriya), those with two senses and so forth;  &lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;all existent things&quot; (bhútá) denoted all living beings divided into generic types - viz., those produced from an egg, or born from the womb, or sprung from moisture, or propagated from seed;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;all living substances&quot; (jivá) denoted rice, barley, wheat, etc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division of men into six classes (chalabhijátiyo) is noteworthy. Buddhaghosa describes these as being kanha, níla, lohita, halidda, sukka and paramasukka. This closely resembles the curious Jaina doctrine of the six Lesyas. Given, e.g., in the Uttarádhyáyana Sutra (Jacobi's Jaina Sútras ii.213). This seems to involve a conception of mind which is originally colourless by nature. The different colours (níla, etc.) are due to different habits or actions. The supreme spiritual effort consists in restoring mind to its original purity. Cp. with this the Buddha's teaching in A.iii.384ff. and M.i.36. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Anguttara Nikáya (iii.383-4) a similar doctrine is attributed to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa')"&gt;Púrana Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gosála's theory (D.i.54; see also S.iii.211) of the divisions of the universe into fourteen hundred thousand principle states of birth - (pamukhayoniyo) and into various methods of regeneration - viz.,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;seven kinds of animate (saññigabbhá) production, i.e. by means of separate sexes;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;seven of inanimate (asaññigabbhá), such as rice, barley, etc.;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;seven of production by grafting (niganthigabbhá), propagating by joints, such as sugar cane, etc. -  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;seems to show that the Ájívaka believed in infinite gradations of existence, in the infinity of time, and also in the </data>
<data>recurrent cycles of existence. Each individual has external existence, if not individually, at least in type. In the world as a whole everything comes about by necessity. Fate (nigati) regulates everything, all things being unalterably fixed. Just as a ball of string when cast forth spreads out just as far as, and no farther than it can unwind, so every being lives, acts, enjoys and ultimately ends, in the manner in which it is destined (sandhavitvá, samsaritvá dukkhassantam karissanti). The peculiar nature (bháva) (DA.i.161) of each being depends on the class or species or type to which it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the views of the Puthusamanas (other teachers), the Buddha regarded the doctrine of the Ájívaka as the least desirable. It denied  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;action (kiriya),  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;endeavour (viriya),  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;result of action (kamma),  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and was therefore despicable (patikhitto) (A.i.286).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha knew of no other single person fraught with such danger and sorrow to all devas and men as was Makkhali; like a fish-trap set at a river mouth, Makkhali was born into the world to be a man-trap for the distress and destruction of men (A.i.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.166),  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa')"&gt;Púrana Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, by propounding a theory of the passivity of soul, denied action; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajitakesakambala')"&gt;Ajita Kesakambala&lt;/a&gt;, by his theory of annihilation, denied retribution, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makkhali_gosala')"&gt;Makkhali Gosála&lt;/a&gt;, by his doctrine of fate, denied both action and its result.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested (E.g. Barua: Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy, p.314) that Makkhali Gosála's doctrine of the eight developmental stages of man (attha purisabhúmi) was a physical antecedent of the Buddha's doctrine of the eight higher spiritual ranks (attha purisapuggalá).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa gives the eight stages as follows: manda, khiddá, vímamsana, ujugata, sekha, samana, jina and panna. DA.i.162 ; see also Hoernle's Uvásaga-Dasáo, ii. p.24, where pannaka is given for panna. op. J.iv.496-7, mandadasaka,khiddá-dasaka,anna-dasaka,etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first stage extends from the first day of birth to the seventh.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second stage those who have come from evil states cry constantly, those from happy conditions smile, remembering their past lives.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third stage is marked by the infant beginning to walk with the help of others. The time of his being able to walk alone is the ujugata-bhúmi.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The period of study is sekha-bhúmi,  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;of leaving household life, samana-bhúmi;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the period of knowledge (vijánana),  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;of constant association with teachers, is the jina-bhúmi and  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the last stage when the jina remains silent (pannaka), is called the pannaka-bhúmi. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to indicate a development of the mental and spiritual faculties, side by side with physical growth, an interaction of body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been a great deal of confusion, even at the time of the compilation of the Nikáyas, as to what were </data>
<data>the specific beliefs of the Ájívakas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus in the Maháli Sutta of the Samyutta Nikáya (iii.69) some of Gosála's views (natthi hetu, natthi paccayo sattánam sankilesáya) are attributed to Púrana Kassapa.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikáya in one place (i.286) apparently confounds Makkhali Gosála with Ajita Kesakambala,  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;while elsewhere (iii.383-4) Púrana Kassapa's views regarding the chalabhijáti are represented as being those of Makkhali.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a group of Ájívakas behind Jetavana. The monks saw the Ájívakas perform various austerities, such as squatting on their heels, swinging in the air like bats, scorching themselves with five fires, and they asked the Buddha whether these austerities were of any use. &quot;None whatever,&quot; answered the Buddha, and then proceeded to relate the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanguttha_jat_144')"&gt;Nanguttha Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.493f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ájívakas used to be consulted regarding auspicious days, dreams, omens, etc. (See, e.g., J.i.287 and MT.190).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a settlement of Ájívakas in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura')"&gt;Anurádhapura&lt;/a&gt;, and Pandukábhaya built a residence for them. Mhv.x.102.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas, following Hoernle, thinks that the term (Ájívaka) was probably a name given by opponents, meaning one who followed the ascetic life for the sake of a livelihood. Op. cit., p.130. But see DhA.i.309, where the different kinds of religieux are distinguished as acelaka, ájívaka, nigantha and tápasa.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a detailed account of the Ájívakas see Hoernle's Article in ERA. and Barua's paper in the Calcutta University Journal of the Dept. of Letters, vol.ii. Hence we cannot infer that the name </data>
<data>which was found as late as the thirteenth century always refers to the followers of Makkhali Gosála. This point is certainly worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Álavaka (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Álavaka.&lt;/b&gt;-The king of Álavi. He was in the habit of holding a hunt once in seven days to keep his army in trim. One day when he was hunting, the quarry escaped from where the king lay in wait and, according to custom, it became the king's duty to capture it. He, therefore, followed the animal for three leagues, killed it and, having cut it in half, carried it in a pingo. On his way back he happened to pass under the banyan tree which was the abode of the Yakkha Álavaka. The Yakkha had been granted a boon by the Yakkha-king, which allowed him to eat anybody who came within the shadow of the tree. Accordingly, he seized the king, but later released him on obtaining his promise that he would provide him at regular intervals with a human being and a bowl of food (SnA.i.217ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the story see Álavaka Yakkha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Álavaka.&lt;/b&gt;-The &lt;b&gt;Yakkha&lt;/b&gt; referred to above.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Álavaka, with the help of the Mayor of the town (Nagaraguttika) and his ministers, was able to keep his promise for some time, by sending criminals to the Yakkha. The Yakkha's power was such that at the sight of him men's bodies became as soft as butter. Soon there were no criminals left, and each household was forced to contribute one child for sacrifice to the Yakkha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then women, about to bring forth children, began to leave the king's capital. Twelve years passed in this manner and the only child left was the king's own son, Álavaka Kumára. When the king learnt this, he ordered the child to be dressed in all splendour and taken to the Yakkha. The Buddha, with his Eye of Compassion, saw what was going to happen and went to the Yakkha's abode.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Álavaka was away at a meeting of the Yakkhas in Himavá. His doorkeeper Gadrabha admitted the Buddha, after warning him of the Yakkha's unmannerly nature. The Buddha went in and sat down on Álavaka's throne while Gadrabha went to Himavá to announce to his master the Buddha's arrival. While the Buddha was there, preaching to Álavaka's women-folk, the Yakkhas &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satagira')"&gt;Sátágira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata')"&gt;Hemavata&lt;/a&gt;, passing through the air on their way to the assembly in Himavá, being made aware of the Buddha's presence by their inability to fly over him, descended to Álavaka's palace and made obeisance to the Buddha before resuming their journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Álavaka heard from Gadrabha and from Sátágira and Hemavata of the Buddha's visit, he was greatly incensed and uttering aloud his name, he hurried to his abode. There with all the various supernatural powers he could command he tried to dislodge the Buddha from his seat, but without success even his special weapon, the Dussávudha being of no avail against the Buddha. Then, approaching the Buddha, Álavaka asked him to leave his house, which the Buddha did. He then summoned the Buddha back and he came. Three times this happened and three times the Buddha obeyed, judging compliance to be the best way of softening his wrath, but the fourth time the Buddha refused to return. Thereupon Álavaka expressed his desire to ask questions of the Buddha, hoping thereby to fatigue him. The Buddha agreed, and when he had answered all the questions to Álavaka's satisfaction, the latter became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;Sotápanna&lt;/a&gt; (SnA.i.239).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At dawn of day, King Álavaka's men brought the young prince, Álavaka-Kumara to the Yakkha, as sacrifice. Hearing the Yakkha's shouts of joy at the close of the Buddha's sermon, they greatly </data>
<data>marvelled. When they announced to Álavaka that they had brought their offering, and handed him the child, he was much ashamed because of the Buddha's presence. Álavaka gave the child to the Buddha, who blessed him and gave him back to the king's messengers. The boy, having passed from the Yakkha's hands to those of the Buddha, and from there to the king's men, thereafter became known as Hatthaka Álavaka (SnA.i.239-40).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the king and the citizens heard that the Yakkha had become a follower of the Buddha, they built for him a special abode near that of Vessavana and provided him with endless gifts of flowers, perfumes, etc., for his use. The story of Álavaka, of which the above is a summary, is given in full in SnA.i.217-40 and in SA.i.244-59. It is also given in brief in AA.i.211-12 and with some difference in detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Álavaka's abode was thirty leagues from Sávatthi, and the Buddha covered the whole journey in one day (SnA.i.220). The abode was near a banyan tree and on the ground (bhummattham,) well protected with walls, etc., and covered on the top by a metal net, it was like a cart enclosed on all sides. It was three leagues in extent, and over it lay the road to Himavá by air (SnA.i.222). Ascetics, having seen the glittering palace, often called to find out what it was. Álavaka would ask them questions regarding their faith, and when they could not answer he would assume a subtle form and, entering their hearts, would drive them mad (SnA.i.228).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Álavaka shouted his name before starting from Himavá to vanquish the Buddha. He stood with his left foot on Manosilátala and his right on Kelásakúta. His shout was heard throughout &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa')"&gt;Jambudípa&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the four shouts, mentioned in tradition, as having travelled so far (SnA.i.223; for the others see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaka')"&gt;Punnaka&lt;/a&gt;, </data>
<data>&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vissakamma')"&gt;Vissakamma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusa')"&gt;Kusá&lt;/a&gt;). Álavaka had a special weapon, the Dussávudha, comparable to Sakka's Vajirávudha, Vessavana's Gadávudha and Yama's Nayanávudha. It had the power, if it were thrown into the sky, of stopping rain for twelve years and if cast on the earth of destroying all trees and crops for a like period. If hurled into the sea it would dry up all the water, and it could shatter Sineru into pieces. It was made of cloth and is described as a vatthávudha, and it was worn as a part of the Yakkha's upper garment (uttariya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three salient features in the story of Álavaka which link it closely to the large circle of stories grouped by Professor Watanabe (J.P.T.S.1909-10, pp.240ff) under the title of Kalmásapáda stories: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) The man-eating Yakkha; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) the captured king saving himself by a promise to provide the Yakkha with offerings, and the sanctity of that promise; and &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) the conversion of the Yakkha.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversion of Álavaka is considered one of the chief incidents of the Buddha's life (E.g., J.iv.180; vi.329; Mhv.xxx.84).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Álavaka's name appears in the Atánátiya Sutta, among the Yakkhas to whom followers of the Buddha should appeal for protection in time of need (D.iii.205). (See also Álavaka Sutta.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Álavaka Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Records the eight questions asked of the Buddha by Álavaka Yakkha and the answers given by the Buddha. It is said (SnA.i.228) that Álavaka's parents had learnt the questions and their answers from Kassapa Buddha and had taught them to Álavaka in his youth; but he could not remember them and, in order that they might be </data>
<data>preserved, he had them written on a gold leaf with red paint, and this he stored away in his palace. When the Buddha answered the questions he found that the answers were exactly the same as those given by Kassapa (SnA.i.231). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta appears both in Sutta Nipáta (pp.31-3) and in the Samyutta Nikáya (i.213ff). The Álavaka Sutta is also included in the collection of Parittas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Álavaka Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A conversation between the Buddha and Hatthaka Álavaka in which the Buddha states that he is among those who enjoy real happiness.

Ákása Sutta.-A conversation between Sáriputta and Ananda at Sávatthi on the attainment of and dwelling in the sphere of the infinity of space (S.iii.237). The full title of the Sutta should be Ákásánañcáyatana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

In a previous birth he worshipped with gladsome heart the thupa of Sikhí Buddha and gave carpenters money to build an áyága (a long alms-hall, says ApA.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result he was born in deva worlds and could bring even the devas into subjection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could produce rain at will.

Once as they were going together for alms to Sávatthi, Vangísa confessed that he was disaffected. Ánanda advised him on how to overcome the disaffection by proper cultivation of the senses. S.i.188.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Once Ánanda was living in a forest tract in the Kosala country and was much occupied in talking to the laity who came to see him. A deva of the forest, desiring his welfare, came up to him and suggested that he might stop his constant babbling and meditate instead (S.i.199). According to Buddhaghosa (SA.i.225), this was soon after the Buddha's death, shortly before Ánanda became arahant. People, knowing of his close attendance on the Master, were ever asking for details about the Parinibbána and when they mourned he had to admonish them. He used to wander about, taking with him the Buddha's begging bowl and robe. In the Theragáthá (ver.119; ThagA.i.237) the same admonition is put into the mouth of a Vajjiputta monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Preached by the Buddha to Ánanda, who asked how nirodha could be obtained. By the cessation of the five khandhas, answered the Buddha. S.iii.24-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A conversation between the Buddha and Ánanda, at Jetavana. Ánanda is asked in what things one discerns the arising (uppáda), passing away (vaya), and constant change (aññathatta). The answer is &quot;in the five khandhas.&quot; The Buddha praises Ánanda for his answer. S.iii.37-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Same as above, except that the discernment is not only with regard to the present, but also to the </data>
<data>past and the future. S.iii.38-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Ánanda tells the monks in Jetavana how when he and his colleagues were novices, Punna Mantániputta was very helpful to them and instructed them as to how the conceit of self (asmimána) arose and how it could be overcome. Having heard him, Ánanda says he fully understood the Dhamma. S.iii.105-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Preached at Jetavana. Ánanda asks the Buddha about psychic power (iddhi), its basis and cultivation, and the practice thereof. The Buddha enlightens him. S.v.285-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Same as above, with the addition of Ánanda's declaration that the monks consider the Buddha as their guide, etc. S.v.286.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Preached at Jetavana. Ánanda is instructed as to how concentration on breathing (ánápánasati) leads to the four satipatthánas and how these, in turn, bring to completion the seven bojjhangas. These last lead to complete knowledge and release (vijjávimutti). The methods of their development are explained in detail. S.v.328-33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Same as above, the only difference being the same as between 7 and 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Records a visit paid to Ánanda at Jetavana by Sáriputta, who was also staying there. Sáriputta tells Ánanda that sotápannas are those that have no disloyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. They have no such immorality as is possessed by the uneducated putthujjanas. S.v.362-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Preached at the Ghositáráma in Kosambi. Ánanda asks the Buddha how monks could enjoy ease (phásuvihára) and the Buddha tells him (A.iii.132-4).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A conversation between Ánanda and Mahá Kotthita with regard to what happens after the passionless, remainder less ending of the six spheres of contact. A.ii.162. The P.T.S. text puts this under Kotthita Sutta, but both the Commentary and the Uddána at the end of the Vagga treat it as a separate sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Ánanda goes to Sáriputta and asks him how far a monk could learn the Dhamma, remember it, reflect upon it and teach it to others. Sáriputta suggests that Ánanda should answer the question himself, which Ánanda does. At the end of the discourse Sáriputta utters an eulogy on Ánanda and calls him the pattern of the true monk. A.iii.361-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Ánanda Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Preached by the Buddha in reply to Ánanda's question as to how notions of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; and the tendency to vain conceit could be completely destroyed (A.i.132f). This sutta refers to the Punnaka-pañha of the Paráyana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Ánanda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A conversation between Ánanda and Udáyí on the wonders of a Tathágata's attainment and the nature of perception. In the course of the dialogue Ánanda mentions a visit paid to him by a nun who was a follower of the Jatilas, and her questions on samádhi. A.iv.426.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. Ánanda Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-A discourse given to the monks by Ánanda on the good man and the wicked man. A.v.6f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;18. Ánanda Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-On the ten qualities that a monk should possess if he would benefit by the practice of the Buddha's teachings. A.v.152ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ánanda or Atthatta Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The Paribbájaka Vacchagotta visits the Buddha and asks him if there is a self. The </data>
<data>Buddha makes no reply even when the question is repeated, and Vacchagotta goes away. The Buddha, later, explains to Ánanda, in reply to his inquiry, that he remained silent because whatever answer he gave to Vacchagotta's question, it would be capable of being misunderstood and misinterpreted. S.iv.400-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ánanda Vagga.&lt;/b&gt;-The eighth chapter of the Tíká Nipáta of the Anguttara Nikáya. It consists of ten suttas, the last of which contains a prophecy regarding Ánanda. A.i.215-28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Thirty thousand people were converted. Ibid., xv.178-9; Sp.i.80; Mbv.133.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ánaka (v.l. Ánnaka)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mutinga (kettle-drum) belonging to the Dasárahas. As it grew old and began to split, they fixed in another peg, and this process was continued, until, at last, the original drumhead vanished, leaving only the framework of pegs (S.ii.266). The origin of the drum is related in the Kakkata Játaka. When the Golden Crab, there mentioned, was trampled to death by the elephants, his two claws broke away from his body and lay apart in the Kulíradaha, where he lived. During the floods the water flowed from the Ganges into this lake, running back again when the floods subsided. The two claws were thus carried into the Ganges. One of them reached the sea, and the Asuras, picking it up, made thereof the drum named Álambara. The other was picked up by the Ten Royal Brothers (evidently the Dasárahas mentioned above) while playing in the river, and they made of it the little drum Ánaka (J.ii.344; the Játaka is quoted in SA.ii.167-8, with several variations in detail).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Commentary (ii.167-8) it is said that the drum was like molten wag in colour, because the crab's claw had been dried by wind and sun. The sound of the drum was heard for twelve leagues, and it was, therefore, used only on festive occasions. On hearing it, the people assembled hurriedly, in various conveyances, decked with splendour. It was called Ánaka because it brought the people together as if summoning them (mahájanam pakkositvá viya ánetí ti Ánako). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when the original drumhead had vanished, it could hardly be heard even inside a hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ánaka drum is used as a simile in the Áni Sutta (S.ii.266-7; see also KS.ii.178, n.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Árámadúsaka Játaka (No. 46).&lt;/b&gt;-Once in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; there was a festival and all the townsfolk assembled to keep holiday. The king's gardener, wishing to join in the festivities, approached the king of the monkeys who lived in the royal garden and, pointing out to him all the benefits the monkeys had derived from their residence there, asked him if he would get the monkeys to water the trees in the gardener's absence. The monkey-king agreed and, when the man had gone, distributed the water-skins and water-pots among the monkeys. In order that the water should not be wasted, he gave instructions to the monkeys that they should pull out the trees by the roots and give plenty of water to those plans whose roots went deep and little to those with small roots. A wise man, happening to see this being done, and reflecting how with every desire to do good, the foolish only succeed in doing harm, rebuked the monkey-king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told by the Buddha while staying in a hamlet in Kosala. The squire of the village invited the Buddha and his monks to a meal and at the conclusion of the meal gave them leave to stroll about in the grounds. In their walk the monks came across a bare patch of land and learnt from the gardener that it was caused by a lad who had been asked to water the plants there and who, before watering them had pulled them out to see how they grew. This was reported to the Buddha, who related the story of the past. J.i.249-51. The story is sculptured in the Bharhut Stupa: See Cunningham, Pl.xlv.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Árámadúsaka Játaka (No. 268).&lt;/b&gt;-Same as the above except that the monkeys are asked to water the garden for seven days, </data>
<data>and the conversation between the wise man (in this case a young man of good family belonging to Benares) and the monkey-king is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is told in reference to a lad in Dakkhinágiri and not in Kosala as above. J.ii.345-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ákásacetiya&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cetiya in Rohana in South Ceylon, not far from Cittalapabbata Vihára, so named because it is situated on the summit of a rock. It is not known when and by whom it was built. King Kákavanna-Tissa fixed to it stone slabs, to make it easier of ascent (Mhv.xxii.26).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were probably two cetiyas of the same name, one being in Rohana and the other to the east of Anurádhapura. It is the latter which is mentioned in the thirty-third chapter of the Mahávamsa (Vers. 68-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vattagámani, going up with his queen to the Ákásacetiya, saw his minister, Kapisísa, who had just come down from the cetiya, where he had been sweeping the courtyard, sitting by the road; because he did not fling himself down before the king, the latter slew him in anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Ákásacetiya was near Acchagalla Vihára, which, according to the Mahávamsa Tíká (MT.302), was to the east of Anurádhapura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be that Ákásacetiya was a common name for any vihára built on the summit of a rock, for the Commentaries (AA.i.375; MA.ii.955) speak also of an Ákásacetiya at Sumanagiri (Sumanakúta) at which the Tamil general Díghajantu offered a red silken robe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Átánátiya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thirty-second sutta of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diigha_nikaaya')"&gt;Digha Nikáya&lt;/a&gt;, preached at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gijjhakuuta')"&gt;Gijjhakúta&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.194ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Four Great Kings (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa')"&gt;Cattáro Mahárájáno&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;having set a guard over the four quarters, visited the Buddha. Having saluted him and sat down with hosts of other &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yakkha')"&gt;Yakkhas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessavana')"&gt;Vessavana&lt;/a&gt; told the Buddha that the Yakkhas did not, for the most part, believe in the Buddha for the reason that they did not find it pleasant or agreeable to abstain from the things which he declared to be evil - such as the taking of life, theft, etc. And in order that the Buddha's disciples, haunting lonely and remote parts of the forest where the Yakkhas dwelt, might find protection from them, Vessavana suggested that the Buddha might learn the Átánátiya word-rune (rakkha). The Buddha agreeing, Vessavana proceeded to recite it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It opens with a salutation to the seven Buddhas, beginning with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii')"&gt;Vipassí&lt;/a&gt;. The remainder contains a list of the gods and other superhuman beings, the Four Great Kings heading the list; these last are described at some length; forty-one other gods are mentioned as a kind of appendix or afterthought, all mentioned one after another with no attempt at group division and without any details, in what are, apparently, mnemonic doggerels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A part of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s')"&gt;Mahásamaya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (sections 10-20) looks very much like an improved and enlarged edition of this list of bare names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha learnt the word-rune and </data>
<data>taught it to the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Átánátiya Sutta is now regarded as a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paritta')"&gt;Paritta&lt;/a&gt;, and its influence pervades a hundred million world systems (VibhA.430). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ceylon, for instance, it is recited with great fervour at the conclusion of the Paritta ceremonies, particularly in times of illness, in order to ward off evil spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is included in the list of Parittas found in the Milinda-pañha, p.151; on the importance of this sutta in the history of India, see Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, pp.219-37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DA.iii.969 gives a long description of the ritual to be followed when reciting the Atánátiya Paritta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</data>

Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the principal disciples of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. He was a first cousin of the Buddha and was deeply attached to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He came to earth from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tusita')"&gt;Tusita&lt;/a&gt; and was born on the same day as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt;, his father being&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/amitodana')"&gt;Amitodana&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya')"&gt;Sákiyan&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanama_th')"&gt;Mahánáma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; were therefore his brothers (or probably step-brothers). According to the Mtu.iii.176, Ánanda was the son of Suklodana and the brother of Devadatta and Upadhána. His mother was Mrgí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda entered the Order in the second year of the Buddha's ministry, together with other Sákiyan princes, such as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya')"&gt;Bhaddiya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhagu_th')"&gt;Bhagu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kimbila')"&gt;Kimbila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;, and was ordained by the Buddha himself (Vin.ii.182), his upajjháya being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/belatthasisa_th')"&gt;Belatthasísa&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.68; also DA.ii.418ff.; Vin.i.202; iv. 86). Soon after, he heard a discourse by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punna')"&gt;Punna Mantániputta&lt;/a&gt; and became a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/../wtb/s_t/sotaapanna')"&gt;Sotápanna&lt;/a&gt;. In S.iii.105 Ánanda acknowledges his indebtedness to Punna and gives an account of Punna's sermon to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first twenty years after the </data>
<data>Enlightenment, the Buddha did not have the same personal attendants all the time. From time to time various monks looked after him, among them being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagasamala_th')"&gt;Nágasamála&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagita')"&gt;Nágita&lt;/a&gt;, Upavána, Sunakkhatta, the novice Cunda, Ságata, Rádha and Meghiya. We are told that the Buddha was not particularly pleased with any of them. At the end of twenty years, at an assembly of the monks, the Buddha declared that he was advanced in years and desired to have somebody as his permanent body-servant, one who would respect his wishes in every way. The Buddha says that sometimes his attendants would not obey him, and on certain occasions had dropped his bowl and robe and gone away, leaving him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the great disciples offered their services, but were rejected by the Buddha. Ánanda alone was left; he sat in silence. When asked why he did not offer himself, his reply was that the Buddha knew best whom to choose. When the Buddha signified that he desired to have Ánanda, the latter agreed to accept the post on certain conditions. The Buddha was never to give him any choice food or garment (*) gotten by him, nor appoint for him a separate &quot;fragrant cell&quot; (residence), nor include him in the invitations accepted by the Buddha. For, he said, if the Buddha did any of these things, some would say that Ánanda's services to the Buddha were done in order to get clothes, good fare and lodging and be included in the invitations. Further he was to be allowed to accept invitations on behalf of the Buddha; to bring to the Buddha those who came to see him from afar; to place before the Buddha all his perplexities, and the Buddha was to repeat to him any doctrine taught in his absence. If these concessions were not granted, he said, some would ask where was the advantage of such service. Only if these privileges were </data>
<data>allowed him would people trust him and realise that the Buddha had real regard for him. The Buddha agreed to the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(*) Ánanda did, however, accept one of   the two robes given by Pukkusa the Mallan to the Buddha (D.ii.133);   Buddhaghosa explains this by saying that Ánanda's period of service had now   come to an end, and also he wished to be free from the accusation that even   after having served the Buddha for twenty-five years, the Buddha had never   made him any gift. It is further stated that Ánanda offered the robe to the   Buddha later (DA.ii.570).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thenceforth, for twenty-five years (Thag.v.1039), Ánanda waited upon the Buddha, following him like a shadow, bringing him water and toothpick, washing his feet, accompanying him everywhere, sweeping his cell and so forth. By day he was always at hand, forestalling the Master's slightest wish; at night, stout staff and large torch in hand, he would go nine times round the Buddha's Gandha-kuti in order to keep awake, in case he were needed, and also to prevent the Buddha's sleep from being disturbed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account here given is summarised from AA.i.159ff. and from ThagA.ii.121ff. On the boons see J.iv.96, where Ánanda had asked for boons in the past too. The Tibetan sources give a different and interesting version of Ánanda's entry into the Order. See Rockhill: Life of the Buddha, 57-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many examples are given of- Ánanda's solicitude for the Buddha, particularly during the Buddha's last days, as related in the Mahá Parinibbána Sutta. Ánanda was the Buddha's equal in age (having been born on the same day), and it is touching to read of this old and most devoted attendant ministering to his eminent cousin, fetching him water, bathing him, rubbing his body, preparing his bed, and receiving last </data>
<data>instructions from him on various matters of importance. It is said that when the Buddha was ill, Ánanda became sympathetically sick (D.ii.99). He was aware of every change that occurred in the Buddha's body. E.g., the brightening of his features after Janavasabha's visit (D.ii.204); and the fading of his complexion just before death, which was apparent when the Buddha put on the robe given by Pukkusa (ibid., 133).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when acting on the instructions of Devadatta, the royal mahouts let loose Nálágiri, maddened with drink, on the Buddha's path, so that he might trample the Buddha to death, Ánanda, seeing the animal rushing towards them, immediately took his stand in front of the Buddha. Three times the Buddha forbade him to do so, but Ánanda, usually most obedient, refused to move, and it is said that the Buddha, by his iddhi-power, made the earth roll back in order to get Ánanda out of the elephant's path. [J.v.335-6; it was in this connection that the Cúlahamsa Játaka was preached to show that Ánanda had, in previous births also, renounced his life to save that of the Buddha; see also DhA.i.119. The Cullavagga account of the Nálágiri incident makes no mention of Ánanda's past (Vin.ii.195)]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the extreme zealousness of Ánanda drew on him the Buddha's rebuke - e.g., when he prepared tekatuka gruel (gruel with three kinds of pungent substances) for the Buddha when he was suffering from wind in the stomach. The gruel was prepared from food kept indoors and was cooked by Ánanda himself, indoors; this was against the rules (Vin.i.210-11), but Ánanda knew that the gruel would cure the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda was most efficient in the performance of the numerous duties attached to his post. Whenever the Buddha wished to summon the monks or to send a message to anyone, it was to Ánanda that </data>
<data>he entrusted the task. See, e.g., D.ii.199; 147; Vin.i.80; M.i.456.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reported to the Buddha any news which he beard and thought interesting. E.g., the death of Nigantha Nátaputta, of which he learnt from Cunda Samanuddesa (D.iii.118; M.ii.244); also Devadatta's conspiracy to harm the Buddha (Vin.ii.198).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laymen and laywomen, wishing to give alms to the Buddha and the monks, would often consult him in their difficulties, and he would always advise them. E.g., the Andhakavinda Bráhmana (Vin.i.220-1); Roja the Malla (ibid., 248); see also ibid., 238f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the monks came to him expressing their desire to hear the Buddha preach, he did his best to grant their wish. E.g„ when the Buddha retired into the Párileyya forest (S.iii.95; DhA.i.50f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when Ánanda felt that an interview with the Buddha would be of use to certain people, he would contrive that the Buddha should talk to them and solve their doubts; thus, for instance, he arranged an interview for the Nigantha Saccaka (M.i.237) and the brahmins Sangárava and Rammaka (S.i.163; M.i.161). Similarly he took Samiddhi to the Buddha when he found that Samiddhi had wrongly represented the Buddha's views (M.iii.208). When he discovered that Kimbila and a large number of other monks would greatly benefit if the Buddha would preach to them on ánápánasati, he requested the Buddha that he should do so. (S.v.323). Ánanda's requests were, however, not always granted. Once, for instance, though he asked the Buddha three times to recite the Pátimokkha, the Buddha refused to do so until an offending monk had been removed (Vin.ii.236f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, when at Vesáli, as a result of the Buddha's talks to the monks on asubha, a large number of them, feeling shame and loathing for their bodies, committed suicide, Ánanda suggested to the Buddha </data>
<data>that he might teach the monks some method by which they might obtain insight (aññá) (S.v.320f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order that people might still worship the Buddha when he was away on tour, Ánanda planted the Ánanda-Bodhi (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda was, however, careful that people should not weary the Buddha unnecessarily. Even when he told the Buddha about the suicide of the monks (mentioned above), he was careful to wait till the Buddha had finished his fortnight's solitude, because he had given orders that he should not be disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Subhadda wanted to see the Buddha as he lay on his death-bed, Ánanda refused to let him in until expressly asked to do so by the Master (D.ii.149). That same day when the Mallas of Kusinárá came with their families to pay their last respects to the Buddha, Ánanda arranged them in groups, and introduced each group so that the ceremony might be gone through without delay (D.ii.148).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He often saved the Buddha from unpleasantness by preventing too pious admirers from trying to persuade the Buddha to do what was against his scruples. E.g., Bodhirájakumára, when he asked the Buddha to walk over the carpets in his mansion, Kokanada (Vin.ii.128; M.ii.94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Ánanda's duties was the task of going round to put away anything which might have been forgotten by anyone in the congregation after hearing the Buddha preach (DhA.i.410).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda was often consulted by colleagues on their various difficulties. Thus we find Vangísa (S.i.188; Thag.vers.1223-6) confiding to him his restlessness at the sight of women and asking for his advice. Among others who came to him with questions on various doctrinal matters were Kámabhú (S.iv.165-6), Udáyi (S.v.166-8; A.iv.449), Channa (S.iii.133-4), </data>
<data>and Bhadda (S.v.171-3; ThagA.i.474; he could not, however, be of use to his fellow celibate Bhandu). Nor were these consultations confined to his fellow-monks, for we find the brahmins Ghosita (S.iv.113) and Unnábha (S.v.272), the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakumáraka (A.i.220), the paribbájakas Channa (A.i.215) and Kokanuda (A.v.196), the upásiká Migasálá (A.iii.347, and again A.v.137), a householder of Kosambí (A.i.217) and Pasenadi Kosala (M.ii.112), all coming to him for enlightenment and instruction. It was on this occasion that Pasenadi presented Ánanda with a valuable piece of foreign material which had been sent to him by Ajátasattu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the monks, having heard a brief sermon from the Buddha, would seek out Ánanda to obtain from him a more detailed exposition, for he had the reputation of being able to expound the Dhamma (A.v.225; S.iv.93).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the Buddha would often deliberately shorten his discourse to the monks so that they might be tempted to have it further explained by Ánanda. They would then return to the Buddha and report to him Ánanda's exposition, which would give him an opportunity of praising Ánanda's erudition. MA.i.81; for such praise see, e.g., A.v.229. It is said that once when a certain landowner asked the Buddha how he could show honour to the Dhamma, the Buddha told him to show honour to Ánanda if he wished to honour the Dhamma (J.iv.369). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sekha Sutta (M.i.353ff ) we are told that after the Buddha had preached to the Sákiyans of Kapilavatthu till late at night, he asked Ánanda to continue the discourse while he himself rested. Ánanda did so, and when the Buddha awoke after his sleep, he commended Ánanda on his ability. On another occasion, the Buddha asks Ánanda to address the monks on the wonders attendant on a Buddha's birth, and the Acchari-yabbhuta-Dhamma Sutta </data>
<data>is the result. The Buddha is mentioned as listening with approval (M.iii.119ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Ánanda would suggest to the Buddha a simile to be used in his discourse, e.g. the Dhammayána simile (S.v.5); or by a simile suggest a name to be given to a discourse, e.g. the Madhupindika Sutta (M.i.114; cp. Upavána suggesting the name for the Pásádika Sutta D.iii.141); or again, particularly wishing to remember a certain Sutta, he would ask the Buddha to give it a name, e.g. the Bahudhátuka Sutta (M.iii.67).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several instances occur of Ánanda preaching to the monks of his own accord (E.g., A.ii.156f.; v.6) and also to the laity (E.g., A.ii.194). The Sandaka Sutta records a visit paid by Ánanda with his followers to the paribbajaka Sandaka, and describes how he won Sandaka over by a discourse. Sometimes, as in the case of the Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.189f ) Ánanda would repeat to the assembly of monks a sermon which he had previously heard the Buddha preach. Ánanda took the fullest advantage of the permission granted to him by the Buddha of asking him any question he desired. He had a very inquiring mind; if the Buddha smiled he would ask the reason (M.ii.45, 50, 74; A.iii.214f.; J.iii.405; iv.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or if he remained silent, Ánanda had to be told the reason (S.iv.400). He knew that the Buddha did nothing without definite cause; when Upavána, who stood fanning the Buddha, was asked to move away, Ánanda wished to know the reason, and was told that Upavána prevented various spirits from seeing the Buddha (D.ii.139). The Buddha was always willing to answer Ánanda's questions to his satisfaction. Sometimes, as in the case of his question regarding the dead citizens of Ñátiká (D.ii.91ff.),* a long discourse would result.**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* In this case the discourse concluded </data>
<data>  with a description of the Dhammádása (Mirror of Truth) to be used for all   time; see also S.v.356-60.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;** The Pabbajjá Sutta (Sn.72ff.), was   preached because of Ánanda's request that the Buddha should give an account of   his renunciation (SnA.ii.381); see also Pubbayogávacara Sutta (SnA.i.47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most often his consultations with the Buddha were on matters of doctrine or were connected with it - e.g., on nirodha (S.iii.24); loka (S.iv.53); suñña (S.iv.54; M.iii.104-24); vedaná (S.iv.219-21) ; iddhi (S.v.282-4; 286); ánápánasati (S.v.328-34); bhava, etc. (A.i.223f.); on the chalabhijáti of Púrana Kassapa (q.v.); the aims and purposes of síla (A.v.1f., repeated in v.311f.); the possibilities of samádhi (A.v.7f., repeated in v.318 and in A.i.132f.); on sanghabheda (A.v.75ff.); the qualities requisite to be a counsellor of monks (A.iv.279ff.); the power of carrying possessed by a Buddha's voice (A.i.226f.); the conditions necessary for a monk's happiness (A.iii.132f.); the different ways of mastering the elements (M.iii.62f.); the birthplace of &quot;noble men&quot; (DhA.iii.248); and the manner in which previous Buddhas kept the Fast-day (DhA.iii.246). To these should be added the conversations on numerous topics recorded in the Maháparinibbána Sutta. Some of these questions - e.g., about earthquakes (D.ii.107ff.; A.iv.312ff.) and the different kinds of spirits present at the death of the Buddha (D.ii.139f.) - seem to have been put into Ánanda's mouth in order that they might be used as pegs on which to hang beliefs connected with them which were current among later-day Buddhists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all the Suttas addressed to Ánanda are, however, the result of his questions. Sometimes he would repeat to the Buddha conversations he had had with others and talks he had overheard, and the </data>
<data>Buddha would expound in detail the topics occurring therein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, for instance, a conversation with Pasenadi Kosala on Kalyánamittatá is repeated and the Buddha explains its importance (S.i.87-9; v.2-3) ; Ánanda tells the Buddha about his visit to the Paribbajakáráma in Kosambi and what he there heard about a bhikkhu being called niddasa after twelve years of celibacy. The Buddha thereupon expounds the seven niddasavatthu (A.iv.37ff.). The account conveyed by Ánanda of Udáyí preaching to a large crowd leads to an exposition of the difficulties of addressing large assemblies and the qualities needed to please them (A.iii.184). A conversation between Udáyí and the carpenter Pañcakanga on feelings is overheard by Ánanda and reported to the Buddha, who gives a detailed explanation of his views on the subject (S.iv.222f.; M.i.397f.). The same thing happens when Ánanda mentions to the Buddha talks he had heard between Sáriputta and the Páribbájakas (S.ii.35-7) and between the same Elder and Bhúmiya (S.ii.39-41). Sometimes - as in the case of the upásiká Migasálá (A.iii.347; v.137) - Ánanda would answer questions put to him as best he could, and seek the Buddha's advice and corrections of his interpretation of the Doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the monks asked Ánanda whether the Buddha's predictions regarding the results of Devadatta's crimes were based on actual knowledge, he furnished them with no answer at all until he had consulted the Buddha (A.iii.402). Similarly, when Tapussa questions him as to why household life is not attractive to laymen, Ánanda takes him straight away to the Buddha, who is spending his siesta in the Mahávana in Uruvelakappa (A.iv.438f.). Once Ánanda fancies that he knows all about causation, and tells the Buddha how glad he is that he should understand this difficult subject. The </data>
<data>Buddha points out to him that he really knows very little about it and preaches to him the Mahánidána Sutta (D.ii.55ff.; S.ii.92-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ánanda realises that the Buddha will die in a short while, with childlike simplicity, he requests the Buddha to make a last pronouncement regarding the Order (D.ii&lt;st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID=".98 ff"&gt;.98 ff&lt;/st2:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;.; S.v.152-4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On several occasions it is news that Ánanda brings to the Buddha - e.g., about the death of the Nigantha Nátaputta, and about Devadatta's plots, already mentioned - which provoke the Buddha to preach to him: Phagguna has died, and at his death his senses seemed very clear; so they would, says the Buddha, and proceeds to speak of the advantages of listening to the Dhamma in due season (A.iii.381f.). Or again, Girimánanda is ill and would the Buddha go and see him? The Buddha suggests that Ánanda should go and tell Girimánanda about the ten kinds of saññá (aniccasññá, etc.), and the patient will recover (A.v.108f.). Ánanda desires to retire into solitude and develop zeal and energy; would the Buddha tell him on which topics to meditate? And the Buddha preaches to him the doctrine of impermanence (S.iii.187; iv.54-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, however, often preached to Ánanda without any such provocation on various topics - e.g., on the nature of the sahkhára (S.iii.3740); on the impossibility of the monk without faith attaining eminence in the sásana (A.v.152ff.); on the power the Buddha has of knowing which doctrines would appeal to different people and of preaching accordingly (A.v.36f.); on immorality and its consequences (A.i.50f.); on the admonitions that should be addressed to new entrants to the Order (A.iii.138f.); on the advice which should be given to friends by those desiring their welfare </data>
<data>(A.i.222).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The various topics on which the Buddha discoursed to Ánanda as recorded in the Mahá Parinibbána Sutta, have already been referred to. Some of them - e.g., on the eight assemblies, the eight positions of mastery, the eight stages of deliverance (D.ii.112) - seem to be stereotyped later additions. On the other hand, with regard to the accounts of the honours to be paid to a Buddha's dead body, the places of pilgrimage for the pious, and various other similar subjects, it is impossible to say how far they are authentic. In a few instances the remarks addressed to Ánanda seem to be meant for others, to be heard by them or to be conveyed to them - e.g., in the dispute between Udáyí and Sáriputta, when they both seek the Buddha for him to settle the differences in opinion between them (A.iii.192ff.); or, again, when the recalcitrant Udáyí fails to answer the Buddha's question on subjects of reflection (anussatitthána), and Ánanda gives an answer which the Buddha approves (A.iii.322ff.). A question asked by Ánanda as to whether there are any scents which spread even against the wind, results in the well-known sermon about the fame of the holy man being wafted everywhere (A.i.222f.; DhA.i.420ff.). Once or twice Ánanda intervenes in a discussion between the Buddha and another, either to ask a question or to suggest a simile which he feels could help the Buddha in establishing his point - e.g., in the interviews of Uttiya Paribbájaka (A.v.194), of the brahmin Sangárava (A.i.169), and again of Vidúdabha, son of Pasenadi (M.ii.130).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahá Málunkyá Sutta (M.i.433), it is Ánanda's intervention which evokes the discourse on the Five Fetters. Similarly he intervenes in a discussion between the Buddha and Párásariya's pupil, Uttara, and persuades the Buddha to preach the Indriyabhávaná Sutta on </data>
<data>the cultivation of the Faculties (M.iii.298ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa gives a list of the discourses which bring out the eminence and skill of Ánanda; they are the Sekha, Báhitiya, Ánañjasappáya, Gopaka-Moggallána, Bahudhátuka, Cúlasuññata, Mahásuññata, Acchariyabbhuta, Bhaddekaratta, Mahánidá-na, Maháparinibbána, Subha and Cúlaniyalokadhátu. (For particulars of these see under the respective names.) The books give accounts of several conversations between Ánanda and his eminent colleagues, such as Sáriputta. See also his conversation with Musíla, and Savittha and Nárada at Kosambí in the Ghositáráma (S.ii.113f.). He seems to have felt happy in their company and did not hesitate to take to them his difficulties; thus we find him asking Sáriputta why only certain beings in this world reach parinibbána (A.ii.167); on another occasion he asks Sáriputta about the possibilities of samádhi (A.v.8). On the other hand, at least twice (A.iii.201f.; 361f.), when Ánanda asks his questions of Sáriputta, the latter suggests that Ánanda himself should find the answer, and having heard it, Sáriputta praises him highly and extols his abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda's special friends seem to have been Sáriputta, Moggallána, Mahá Kassapa, Anuruddha and Kankhá Revata (E.g., M.i.212f). He was the Sangha-navaka among them all, yet they held him in high esteem (MA.i.436). Ánanda and Sáriputta were very special friends. It is said that Sáriputta loved Ánanda because the latter did for the Buddha what Sáriputta would wish to have done himself, and Ánanda respected Sáriputta because he was the Buddha's chief disciple. Young men who were ordained by either of them would be sent to the other to learn under him. They shared between them any good thing given to them. Once Ánanda was presented by a brahmin with a costly robe; immediately he wished to give it to Sáriputta, but as the latter was away at the </data>
<data>time, he obtained the Buddha's permission to keep it for him till his return (Vin.i.289; Sp.iii.636-7; MA.i.436).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikáya (i.63-4) contains an eulogy on Sáriputta by Ánanda, where the latter speaks of his comprehensive and manifold wisdom, joyous and swift, of his rampant energy and readiness to accept advice. When he hears of Sáriputta's death from Cunda the Samanuddesa, he goes to the Buddha with Cunda (not wishing to break the news himself) and they take with them Sáriputta's bowl and outer robe, Cunda carrying the ashes, and there Ánanda confesses to the Buddha that when he heard the news he felt as thought his body were drugged, his senses confused and his mind become a blank (S.v.161; Thag.vers.1034-5). The Commentary adds (SA.i.180) that Ánanda was trembling &quot;like a cock escaping from the mouth of a cat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Mahá Kassapa was fond of Ánanda, we may gather from the fact that it was he who contrived to have him elected on the First Council, and when Mahá Kassapa heard of Ánanda's attainment of arahantship, it was he who led the applause (DA.i.11). Ánanda held him in the highest veneration, and on one occasion refused to take part in an upasampadá ordination because he would have to pronounce Kassapa's name and did not consider this respectful towards the Elder (Vin.i.92). In their conversations, Kassapa addresses Ánanda as &quot;ávuso&quot;, Ánanda addresses Kassapa as &quot;bhante.&quot; There is an interview recorded between them in which Kassapa roundly abuses Ánanda, calling him- corn-trampler&quot; and &quot;despoiler of families,&quot; and he ends by up saying , this boy does not know his own measure.&quot; Ánanda had been touring Dahkhinagiri with a large company of monks, mostly youths, and the latter had not brought much credit upon them selves. When Kassapa sees Ánanda on his return </data>
<data>to Rájagaha, he puts on him the whole blame for the youths' want of training. Ánanda winces at being called &quot;boy&quot;; , my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence, yet I am not vexed that you should call me 'boy' even at this time of day.&quot; Thullanandá heard of this incident and showed great annoyance. &quot;How dare Mahá Kassapa,&quot; she says, &quot;who was once a heretical teacher, chide the sage Ánanda, calling him 'boy'?&quot; Mahá Kassapa complains to Ánanda of Thullanandá's behaviour; probably, though we are not told so, Ánanda apologised to him on her behalf (S.ii.217ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, Ánanda, after a great deal of persuasion, took Kassapa to a settlement of the nuns. There Kassapa preached to them, but the nun Thullatissá was not pleased and gave vent publicly to her displeasure. &quot;How does Kassapa think it fit to preach the doctrine in the presence of the learned sage Ánanda? It is as if the needle-pedlar were to deem he could sell a needle to the needle-maker.&quot; Kassapa is incensed at these words, but Ánanda appeases him by acknowledging that he (Kassapa) is in every way his superior and asks him to pardon Tissa. &quot;Be indulgent, your reverence,&quot; says he, &quot;women are foolish.&quot; S.ii.215ff.; the Tibetans say that when Kassapa died, Ajátasattu was very grieved because he had not been able to see the monk's body. Ánanda took the king to the mountain where it had been buried and showed it to him (Rockhill, op. cit., p.162 and n.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this passage Ánanda is spoken of as Vedehamuni. The Commentary (SA.ii.132) explains it by panditamuni, and says further, pandito hi ñánasankhátena vedena íhati sabbakiccáni karoti, tasmá vedeho ti vuccati ; vedeho ca so muni cá ti vedehamuni. Compare with this the derivation of Vedehiputta in connection with Ajátasattu. See also Vedehiká. The </data>
<data>Mtu. (iii.176-7) says that when the Buddha went away from home Ánanda wished to join him, but his mother was unwilling, because his brother, Devadatta, had already gone away. Ánanda therefore went to the Videha country and became a muni. Is this another explanation of the term Vedehamuni?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was perhaps Ánanda's championship of the women's cause which made him popular with the nuns and earned for him a reputation rivalling, as was mentioned above, even that of Mahá Kassapa. When Pajápatí Gotamí, with a number of Sákyan women, undaunted by the Buddha's refusal of their request at Kapilavatthu, followed him into Vesáli and there beseeched his consent for women to enter the Order, the Buddha would not change his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda found the women dejected and weeping, with swollen feet, standing outside the Kútágárasálá. Having learnt what had happened, he asked the Buddha to grant their request. Three times he asked and three times the Buddha refused. Then he changed his tactics. He inquired of the Buddha if women were at all capable of attaining the Fruits of the Path. The answer was in the affirmative, and Ánanda pushed home the advantage thus gained. In the end the Buddha allowed women to enter the Order subject to certain conditions. They expressed their great gratitude to Ánanda (Vin.ii.253ff. Ánanda is again found as intermediary for Pajápatí Gotamí in M.iii.253f). In this connection, the Buddha is reported as having said (Vin.ii.256) that had Ánanda not persuaded him to give his consent to the admission of women to the Order, the Sásana would have lasted a thousand years, but now it would last only five hundred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This championing of the women's cause was also one of the charges brought against Ánanda by his colleagues at the end of the First Council. (See below.)&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was this solicitude for their privileges that prompted him to ask the Buddha one day why it was that women did not sit in public assemblies (e.g. courts of justice), or embark on business, or reap the full fruit of their actions (A.ii.82. See also GS.ii.92, n.2, on the interpretation of the last word).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Ánanda was in the habit of preaching frequently to the nuns is evident from the incidents quoted above and also from other passages (E.g., S.v.154ff.; Thag.v.1020; ThagA.ii.129). He seems also to have been in charge of the arrangements for sending preachers regularly to the nuns. A passage in the Samyutta Commentary (i.210) seems to indicate that Ánanda was a popular preacher among laywomen as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would stand round him when he preached, fanning him and asking him questions on the Dhamma. When he went to Kosambí to impose the higher penalty on Channa, the women of King Udena's harem, hearing of his presence in the park, came to him and listened to his preaching. So impressed were they that they gave him five hundred robes (Vin.ii.290). It was on this occasion that Ánanda convinced Udena of the conscientiousness with which the Sákyaputta monks used everything which was given to them, wasting nothing. The king, pleased with Ánanda, gave him another five hundred robes, all of which he distributed among the community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda had been a tailor in a past birth and had given a Pacceka Buddha a piece of cloth, the size of his hand, and a needle. Because of the gift of the needle he was wise, because of the cloth he got 500 robes (AA.i.239).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar story is related of the women of Pasenadi's palace and their gift to Ánanda. The king was at first angry, but afterwards gave Ánanda one thousand robes (J.ii.24ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (i.382ff ) </data>
<data>says that once Pasenadi asked the Buddha to go regularly to the palace with five hundred monks and preach the Law to his queens Malliká and Vásabhakhattiyá and to the other women in the palace. When the Buddha said that it was impossible for him to go regularly to one place he was asked to send a monk, and the duty was assigned to Ánanda. He therefore went to the palace at stated times and instructed the queens. Malliká was found to be a good student, but not so Vásabhakhattiyá.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka Commentary (i.382) says that the women of the palace were themselves asked which of the eighty chief disciples they would have as their preacher and they unanimously chose Ánanda. For an incident connected with Ánanda's visits to the palace see the Mahására Játaka and also Pasenadi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (ii.533) Ánanda was beautiful to look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda's services seem often to have been sought for consoling the sick. Thus we find Anáthapindika sending for him when he lay ill (M.iii.258), and also Sirivaddha (S.v.176f) and Mánadinna (S.v.177f). He is elsewhere mentioned as helping the Buddha to wait on a sick monk (Vin.i.302). We are told that when the Buddha had his afternoon siesta, Ánanda would spend his time in waiting upon the sick and talking to them (Sp.iii.651). Ánanda was never too busy to show gratitude to his friends. When a certain crow-keeper's family, members of which had been of special service to him, had been destroyed by a pestilence, leaving only two very young boys, he obtained the Buddha's special permission to ordain them and look after them, though they were under the requisite age. (Vin.i.79; to a young monk who used to wait on him and do various services for him, Ánanda gave five hundred robes presented to him by Pasenadi; the monk distributed them to his colleagues).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt;When Ánanda discovered that his friend Roja and Malla had no real faith in the Buddha, he was greatly grieved and interceded on his special behalf with the Buddha that he should make Roja a believer. Later he obtained the Buddha's permission for Roja to offer a meal of potherbs (Vin.i.247-9). In another place we find Roja presenting Ánanda with a linen cloth (Vin.i.296). According to the Játakatthakathá (ii.231) Roja once tried to persuade Ánanda to go back to the lay-life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His sympathy is also shown in the story of the woman who asked to have a share in the Vihára built by Visákhá. She brought a costly carpet, but could find no place in which to put it; it looked so poor beside the other furnishings. Ánanda helped her in her disappointment (DhA.i.415f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in Jetavana, in an assembly of monks, the Buddha spoke the praises of Ánanda, and ranked him the foremost bhikkhu in five respects: erudition, good behaviour (gatimantánam, power of walking, according to Dhammapála), retentive memory, resoluteness and personal attention (A.i.24f). Again, shortly before the Buddha's death, he speaks affectionately of Ánanda (D.ii.144-5; A.ii.132; A.v.229; SA.ii.94f ); Ánanda knew the right time to bring visitors to the Tathágata; he had four exceptional qualities, in that whoever came to see him, monks or nuns, laymen or laywomen, they were all filled with joy on beholding him; when he preached to them they listened with rapture and delight, which never tired. He was called Ánanda because he brought joy to his kinsmen (ThagA.ii.123).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But see the story of Atula (DhA.iii.327), who is not satisfied with Ánanda's preaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another proof of the Buddha's esteem for Ánanda is the incident of his asking Ánanda to design a robe for the monks to be in pattern like a field in Magadha (Vin.i.287).&lt;/p&gt;</data>
<data>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of Ánanda having been the constant companion of the Buddha - probably because of that very fact - it was not until after the Buddha's parinibbána that Ánanda was able to realise Arahantship. Buddhaghosa gives a long account of Ánanda's struggle for final emancipation (DA.i.9ff.); see also Vin.ii.286. Though he was not an arahant he had the patisambhidá, being among the few who possessed this qualification while yet learners (Sekhá) ( VibhA.388). When it was decided by Mahá Kassapa and others that a Convocation should be held to systematise the Buddha's teachings, five hundred monks were chosen as delegates, among them, Ánanda. He was, however, the only non-arahant (sekha) among them, and he had been enjoined by his colleagues to put forth great effort and repair this disqualification. At length, when the convocation assembled, a vacant seat had to be left for him. It had not been until late the previous night that, after a final supreme effort, he had attained the goal. He had been occupied in consoling the laity after the Buddha's death and had had no time for practising meditation. In the end it was a devatá in the woodland grove in Kosala, where he was staying, who pointed out the urgency of the matter (S.i.199-200); but see ThagA.i.237, where the credit for this is given to a Vajjiputta thera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that he won sixfold abhiññá when he was just lying down to sleep, his head hardly on the pillow, his feet hardly off the ground. He is therefore described as having become an arahant in none of the four postures. When he appeared in the convocation, Mahá Kassapa welcomed him warmly and shouted three times for joy. According to the Majjhimabhánaká, says Buddhaghosa, Ánanda appeared on his seat while the others looked on, having come through the earth; according to others he came through </data>
<data>the air. According to ThagA.ii.130, it was a Brahmá of the Suddhávása who announced Ánanda's attainment of arahantship to his colleagues at the Convocation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the convocation, Ánanda was appointed to answer Mahá Kassapa's questions, and to co-operate with him in rehearsing the Dhamma (as opposed to the Vinaya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda came to be known as Dhammabhandágárika, owing to his skill in remembering the word of the Buddha; it is said that he could remember everything spoken by the Buddha, from one to sixty thousand words in the right order; and without missing one single syllable (ThagA.ii.134).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first four Nikáyas of the Sutta Pitaka, every sutta begins with the words &quot;Thus have I heard,&quot; the &quot;I&quot; referring to Ánanda. It is not stated that Ánanda was present at the preaching by the Buddha of every sutta, though he was present at most; others, the Buddha repeated to him afterwards, in accordance with the conditions under which he had become the Buddha's attendant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are told that Ánanda had learnt eighty-two thousand dhamma (topics) from the Buddha himself and two thousand from his colleagues (Thag.v.1024). He had also a reputation for fast talking; where an ordinary man could speak one word Ánanda could speak eight; the Buddha could speak sixteen words for each one word of Ánanda (MA.i.283). Ánanda could remember anything he had once heard up to fifteen thousand stanzas of sixty thousand lines (MA.i.501).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda lived to be very old (one hundred and twenty years, says DhA.ii.99; he is bracketed with Bakkula, as having lived to a great age, AA.ii.596); a hymn of praise sung at his death is included at the end of the stanzas attributed to him in the Theragáthá (Vers.1047-9). That the Buddha's death was a great blow to him is shown by the stanzas he uttered </data>
<data>immediately after the event (D.ii.157). Three months earlier he had heard for the first time that death of the Buddha was near at hand and had besought him to live longer. The reply attributed to the Buddha is a curious one, namely, that on several previous occasions, at Rájagaha and at Vesálí (See, e.g., D.102f), he had mentioned to Ánanda that he could, if he so desired, live for a whole kappa, and had hinted that Ánanda should, if he felt so inclined, request him to prolong his life. Ánanda, however, having failed to take the hint on these occasions, the opportunity was now past, and the Buddha must die; the fault was entirely Ánanda's (Ibid., 114-18). It was when Ánanda was temporarily absent from the Buddha's side that the Buddha had assured Mára that he would die in three months (Ibid., 105-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the end approached, the Buddha noticed that Ánanda was not by his side; on enquiry he learnt that Ánanda was outside, weeping and filled with despair at the thought that the Master would soon be no more, and that he (Ánanda) would have to work out his perfection unaided. The Buddha sent for him and consoled him by pointing out that whatever is born must, by its very nature, be dissolved. Three times he said, &quot;For a long time, Ánanda, you have been very near to me by acts of love, kind and good, never varying, beyond all measure,&quot; and he exhorted him to be earnest in effort, for he would soon realise emancipation. (Ibid., 144). It was on this occasion that the Palása Játaka was preached (J.iii.23ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, earlier, when Udáyi had teased Ánanda for not having benefited from his close association with the personality of the Master, the Buddha had defended Ánanda, saying, &quot;Say not so, Udáyi; should he die without attaining perfect freedom from passion, by virtue of his piety, he would seven times win rule over the devas and seven times be King of </data>
<data>Jambudípa. Howbeit, in this very life shall Ánanda attain to Nibbána. A.i.228.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda did his best to persuade the Buddha to die in one of the great cities, such as Rájagaha or Sávatthi, and not in Kusinárá, the little wattle-and-daub town (as he called it) in the middle of the jungle. He was not satisfied until the Buddha had revealed to him the past history of Kusinárá, how it had once been Kusávatí, the royal capital of the mighty Mahá Sudassana (D.ii.146).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before the Buddha died, Ánanda was commissioned to inform the Mallas of the impending event, and after the Buddha's death, Anuruddha entrusted him, with the help of the Mallas of Kusinááa, with all the arrangements for the funeral (D.ii.158ff). Ánanda had earlier (D.ii.141f) learnt from the Buddha how the remains of a Tathágata should be treated, and now he was to benefit by the instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the First Council, the duty of handing down unimpaired the Digha Nikáya through his disciples was entrusted to Ánanda (DA.i.15). He was also charged with the duty of conveying to Channa the news that the higher penalty (brahmadanda) had been inflicted on him by the Sangha. Ánanda had been deputed by the Buddha himself to carry out this, his last administrative act (D.ii.154), but Ánanda, not wishing to undertake the responsibility alone (knowing that Channa had a reputation for roughness), was granted a number of companions, with whom he visited Channa. The latter expressed repentance and was pardoned (Vin.ii.290-2). Perhaps it was because both the Buddha and Ánanda's colleagues knew of his power to settle disputes that he was chosen for this delicate task. See S.ii.235f., where the Buddha classes him with Sáriputta and Moggallána for his ability to settle disputes among the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda's popularity, however, did not </data>
<data>save him from the recriminations of his fellows for some of his actions, which, in their eyes, constituted offences. Thus he was charged (Vin.ii.288-9) with: (1) having failed to find out from the Buddha which were the lesser and minor precepts which the Sangha were allowed to revoke if they thought fit (See D.ii.154); (2) with having stepped on the Buddha's rainy-season garment when sewing it; (3) with having allowed the Buddha's body to be first saluted by women (not mentioned elsewhere, but see Rockhill, op. cit., p.154); (4) with having omitted to ask the Buddha to live on for the space of a kappa (D.ii.115); and (5) with having exerted himself to procure the admission of women into the Order (Vin.ii.253).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda's reply was that he himself saw no fault in any of these acts, but that he would confess them as faults out of faith in his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion he was found fault with (1) for having gone into the village to beg for alms, clothed in his waist-cloth and nether garment (Vin.i.298); (2) for having worn light garments which were blown about by the wind (Vin.ii.136).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last years of his life, Ánanda seems to have spent in teaching and preaching and in encouraging his younger colleagues. Among those who held discussions with him after the Buddha's passing away are mentioned Dasama of the Atthakanagara (M.i.349f), Gopaka Moggallána (M.iii.7; Thag.ver.1024) and Subha Todeyyaputta (D.i.204ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Páli Canon makes no mention of Ánanda's death. Fa Hsien (Giles trans. 44. The story also occurs in DhA.ii.99ff., with several variations in detail), however, relates what was probably an old tradition. When Ánanda was on his way from Magadha to Vesáli, there to die, Ajátasattu heard that he was coming, and, with his retinue, followed him up to the Rohini River. The chiefs of Vesali also heard the news </data>
<data>and went out to meet him, and both parties reached the river banks. Ánanda, not wishing to incur the displeasure of either party, entered into the state of tejokasina in the middle of the river and his body went up in flames. His remains were divided into two portions, one for each party, and they built cetiyas for their enshrinement (See also Rockhill, op. cit., 165f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Ánanda had been the son of Ánanda, King of Hamsavatí, and was therefore a step-brother of Padumuttara. His name was Sumana. King Ánanda allowed no one but himself to wait on the Buddha. Prince Sumana having quelled an insurrection of the frontier provinces, the king offered him a boon as reward, and he asked to be allowed to entertain the Buddha and his monks for three months. With great reluctance the king agreed, provided the Buddha's consent was obtained. When Sumana went to the vihára to obtain this, he was greatly impressed by the loyalty and devotion of the Buddha's personal attendant, the monk Sumana, and by his iddhi-powers. Having learnt from the Buddha that these were the result of good deeds, he himself determined to lead a pious life. For the Buddha's residence Prince Sumana bought a pleasaunce named Sobhana from a householder of that same name and built therein a monastery costing one hundred thousand. On the way from the capital to Sobhana Park he built viháras, at distances of a league from each other. When all preparations were completed, the Buddha went to Sobhana with one hundred thousand monks, stopping at each vihára on the way. At the festival of dedication of the Sobhana Vihára, Sumana expressed a wish to become a personal attendant of a future Buddha, just as Sumana was of Padumuttara. Towards this end he did many good deeds. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave his upper garment to a monk for him to carry his begging-bowl in it. Later he was born in </data>
<data>heaven and again as King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;. He built for eight Pacceka Buddhas eight monasteries in his royal park (ThagA.ii.121ff) and for ten thousand years he looked after them. The Apadána mentions (i.52f) that he became ruler of heaven thirty-four times and king of men fifty-eight times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ánanda's name occurs in innumerable Játakas; he is identified with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Suriyakumára in the Devadhamma Játaka   (i.133), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cullalohita in the Munika (i.198),  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pajjuna in the Maccha (i.332),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Kálakanni in the Kálakanni (i.365),  &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rádha in the Rádha (i.496),   &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Potthapáda in the Rádha II.

<data>&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was King of Benares in the Káka (i.486), the Tacasára (iii.206) and the Sankhapála (v.177); King Mallika in the Rájováda (ii.5), the Kosala King in the Manikundala (iii.155), King Vanka in the Ghata (iii.170), the Kosavya King in the Dhúmakári (iii.402), King Addhamásaka in the Gangamála (iii.454), and King Dhanañjaya in the Sambhava (v.67), and the Vidhurapandita (vi.329).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahá Náradakassapa Játaka (J.vi.255) Ánanda was born as Rujá, daughter of King Angati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (i.327) states that once when Ánanda was a blacksmith he sinned with the wife of another man. As a result, he suffered in hell for a long time and was born for fourteen existences as some one's wife, and it was seven existences more before the results of his evil deed were exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be some confusion as to the time at which Ánanda entered the Order. In the Canonical account (E.g., Vin.ii.182) he became a monk in the second year of the Buddha's ministry. In the verses attributed to him in the Theragátha (Vers.1039ff), however, he says that he has been for twenty five years a learner (sekha). It is concluded from this that Ánanda must have joined the Order only in the twentieth year after the Enlightenment and the whole story of his having been ordained at the same time as Devadatta is discredited. (See, e.g., Thomas: op. cit., 123. See also Rhys Davids' article on Devadatta in ERE). The verses occur in a lament by Ánanda that his master is dead and that he is yet a learner. The twenty-five years which Ánanda mentions probably refer to the period during which he had been the Buddha's personal attendant and not to his whole career as a monk. During that period, &quot;though he was but a learner, no thoughts of evil arose in him,&quot; the </data>
<data>implication being that his close connection with the Buddha and his devotion to him gave no room for such. He, nevertheless, laments that he could not become an asekha while the Buddha was yet alive. If this interpretation be accepted - and I see no reason why it should not be - there is no discrepancy in the accounts of Ánanda's ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-A Khattiya king of Hamsavati, father of Padumuttara Buddha (J.i.37; Bu.xii.19). He had, by another wife, a daughter Nandá, who became the therí Pakulá in the present age (ThigA.91). Once, with twenty of his ministers and twenty thousand of his subjects, he appeared before Padumuttara Buddha at Mithilá and, having received the &quot;ehi-bhikkhu-pabbajjá,&quot; they became arahants (MA.ii.722; DA.ii.488). The Buddha went back with them to Hamsavatí where he preached the Buddhavamsa (BuA.160).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Ánanda's sons was the prince Sumana, step-brother to Padumuttara, who became Ánanda, the personal attendant of Gotama Buddha. ThagA.ii.122.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Step-brother of Mangala Buddha. He came to Mangala Buddha with ninety crores of followers; having heard the Buddha's preaching, they all became arahants. J.i.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Tissa Buddha, his mother being Subhaddá. Bu.xviii.18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Phussa Buddha, his mother being Kiságotami (Bu.xix.16). The Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.192), however, gives his name as Anupama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-A Pacceka Buddha of ninety-one kappas ago. The thera Citakapújaka, in a previous birth, came down from the deva-loka and cremated the Pacceka Buddha's body with due honour (Ap.i.227). According to the Majjhima Nikáya and its Commentary (M.iii.70; </data>
<data>MA.ii.890), there were four Pacceka Buddhas of this name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-A king of vultures. He dwelt with ten thousand vultures in Gijjhakúta and came to hear Kunála preach. At the end of Kunála's sermon Ánanda, too, discoursed in the same strain, dwelling on the evil qualities of women &quot;keeping to facts within his knowledge&quot; (J.v.424, 447-50). He lived in the Kunáladaha with Nárada, Devala, Punnamukha, the cuckoo, and Kunála (SnA.i.359). In the present age the vulture-king was Ánanda Thera, the Buddha's attendant (J.v.456).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-A king of fishes, appointed by the fishes themselves to rule over them (J.i.207; ii.352). He was one of the six monsters of the deep. He lived on one side of the ocean and all the fishes came to him morning and evening to pay their respects. He lived on rock-slime (sevála) till one day he swallowed, by mistake, a fish. Liking the taste very much, be found out what it was, and from that day he ate fish, unknown to his subjects. Seeing their numbers diminish, they began to grow inquisitive, and one day one of their wise ones hid in the lobe of Ánanda's ear and discovered him eating the fish which straggled behind. When this was reported to the other fish, they fled in terror and hid themselves. Ánanda, desirous of eating them, searched everywhere; believing that they lay inside a mountain, he encircled it with his body. Seeing his own tail on the other side of the mountain and believing it to be a fish trying to escape, he crunched it in a rage. The tail was fifty leagues long and he suffered excruciating pain. Attracted by the smell of blood, the fish collected round and ate him bit by bit. His skeleton was as big as a mountain, and holy ascetics, flying through the air and seeing it below them, told men about it and the story became famous throughout Jambudípa. Kálahatthi </data>
<data>is reported as relating this story to the king in the Mahá Sutasoma Játaka (J.v.462-4). Ánanda is referred to as an example of great deceitfulness. MA.i.138.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt; A yakkha to whom a shrine, called the Ánanda Cetiya, was dedicated. The Cetiya was in Bhoganagara and was later converted into a Buddhist Vihára (AA.ii.550). There the Buddha stayed during his last sojourn, and mention is made of a sermon he preached there to the monks on the Four Great Authorities (cattáro mahápadesá) (D.ii.123-6; A.ii.167). From there he went to Pává.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Ánanda&lt;/b&gt;.-A banker of Sávatthi. He had eighty crores of money, but was a great miser. He had a son, Múlasiri, and once a fortnight he would gather his kinsfolk together and, in their presence, admonish his son as to the desirability of amassing wealth, always increasing it, giving none away. When the banker died he was born in a Candála family outside the city gates. The king appointed Múlasiri banker in his place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the time of Ánanda's conception among the Candálas, misfortune dogged their footsteps. Knowing that a Jonah had come among them, they caused a search to be made and, as a result of their investigations, they sent the pregnant mother away. When the child was born he was a monstrosity with his organs all out of place. When old enough, he was given a potsherd and told to beg his living. One day he came to the house in which he had lived in his former life, and though he managed to enter it, he was discovered and thrown out by the servants. The Buddha happened to be passing by, and sending for Múlasiri, he told him that the beggar had been his father. Being convinced by certain proofs, Múlasiri believed and took refuge in the Buddha (DhA.ii.25-8; the story is referred to in the Milindapañha p.350). It is said </data>
<data>that eighty-four thousand beings attained deathlessness on the occasion of the Buddha preaching to Múlasiri about his father Ánanda. AA.i.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="11"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Author of the Múlatiká on Buddhaghosa's Commentaries on the Abhidhamma (Gv.60, 69; Sas.69). He was originally a native of India, but came over to Ceylon and became head of the Vanavási fraternity in the Island. He probably lived about the eighth or ninth century A.D. and wrote the Múlatiká at the request of a monk named Buddhamitta. He is probably identical with Ánanda, teacher of Culla Dhammapála (see below) (P.L.C.202f.; 216f). He was also known as Vanaratana Tissa from his connection with the Vanavási school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Teacher of Culla Dhammapála, author of the Saccasankhepa. The Saddhamma Sanghala (ix) says that Ánanda was the author of the Saccasankhepa. See also above (Ánanda 11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Teacher of Buddhappiya, author of the Rúpasiddhi. He was a native of Ceylon, for Buddhapiya refers to him as &quot;Tambapannid-dhaja.&quot; He too belonged to the Vanavási sect and wrote a Sinhalese interverbal translation to Piyadassi's Pada-Sádhana and another to the Khudda-Sikkhá. He was a disciple of Udumbaragiri Medhankara, pupil of Sáriputta, and he probably lived in the time of Vijayabáhu III. (P.L.C. 211).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the teacher of Vedeha, author of the Samantakúavannaná (P.L.C. 220). See also Buddhavamsa Vanaratana Ánanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Author of the Saddhammopáyana, also called Abhayagiri-Kavicakravarti Ánanda and probably belonging to the same period as Ánanda (13). His friend and companion, for whom his book was written, was Buddhasoma. An Ánanda, probably a later writer, is </data>
<data>also the author of a Sinhalese Commentary on the Saddhammopáyana. P.L.C.212.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Companion of Chapata and co-founder of the Síhala-Sangha of Burma (Sás.65). He was later cut off from the community for trying to send to his kinsfolk an elephant presented to him by King Narapati. His companions suggested that the animal should be let loose in the forest, in accordance with the Buddha's teaching regarding kindness to animals. Ánanda's reply was that the Buddha had also preached kindness to kinsfolk (Bode: op. cit., 24). He died in 1246 (Forehammer: Jardine Prize Essay, p.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Of Hamsavatí. Author of the Madhusáratthadípaní, a tíká on the Abhidhamma. Sás.48; but see Bode: op. cit., 47-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. Ánanda.&lt;/b&gt;-Called Mánava, in order to distinguish him from others. He was a brahmin youth, maternal cousin of the therí Uppalavanná, with whom he had been in love when she was a laywoman. One day when Upalavanná returned from her alms-rounds to her hut in Andhavana, where she was living at the time, Ánandamánava, who was hiding under her bed, jumped up and seized her. In spite of her protestations and admonitions, he overcame her resistance by force and, having worked his will of her, went away. As if unable to endure his wickedness, the earth burst asunder and he was swallowed up in Avíci (DhA.ii.49-50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order that such assaults should not be repeated, Pasenadi Kosala erected, at the Buddha's suggestion, a residence for the nuns within the city gates, and henceforth they lived only within the precincts of the city (DhA.ii.51f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

Then one of them returned to the world and having procured cattle and money, married and begot a son whom he called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighaayu')"&gt;Dígháyu&lt;/a&gt;. Later, when his former companion came to the city, the householder visited him with his wife and child. When they made obeisance to him, the ascetic said, &quot;Long life to you&quot; to the man and his wife, but not to the child. When questioned, the ascetic told them that their son had but seven days to live, and suggested that they should visit the Buddha and ask him if there were any means of averting the child's fate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did so and the Buddha, who was then staying at the Áraññakutiká in Díghalambika, told them to erect a pavilion outside the door of their house. This they did, and in the pavilion the monks recited the Paritta continuously for seven days with the child seated before them on a bench. On the seventh day the Buddha himself came and hosts of devas gathered round him. The yakkha Avaruddhaka, who had been granted the boon of eating Dígháyu, appeared to claim him at the time appointed for his death, but on account of the presence of the devas, he could not come near the boy. The Buddha recited the Paritta all night long, and when the seventh day had passed Avaruddhaka could no longer claim the child. The Buddha declared that the boy would live for one hundred and twenty years and he was renamed Áyuvaddhana. When he grew up he became the leader of five hundred lay disciples.

But it were better to ponder on the impermanence of the sense organs, their sensations, the consciousness and the contacts connected with them and all that has to do with the mind, because that pondering would produce repulsion and dispassion, freedom and realisation of freedom.

Ásavakkhaya Sutta.-Five things, if practised, lead to the destruction of the ásavas: reflection on what is loathsome, the thought of disgust with regard to food, revulsion from all things, the perception of impermanence in all composite things and the thought of death. A.iii.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ásavakkhaya Sutta.-The holy life is lived for the destruction of the ásavas. S.v.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.

Áyácana Sutta.-The good monk, if he would perfectly aspire, should wish to be like Sáriputta and Moggallána ; the nun to be like Khemá and Uppalavanná; the householder like Citta and Hatthaka; the house-mistress like Khujjuttará and Velukantakí, the mother of Nanda. A.ii.164.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Áyácana Sutta.-Contains the story of the reluctance felt by the Buddha, while meditating at Uruvelá, in the eighth week after the Enlightenment, to preach his doctrine to the world, feeling that it would not appeal to the human temperament; and of the appearance before him, of the Brahmá Sahampatí, who had read his thoughts and who entreated him to overcome this reluctance. He assured the Buddha that there were in the world many who would comprehend the Dhamma if they heard it. The Buddha saw that this assurance was justified and agreed to set forth as a teacher (S.i.136ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta appears verbatim in the Vinaya (i.4ff) and almost verbatim in the Digha Nikáya (ii.36ff), as an episode in the life of each of the Buddhas mentioned there, but with two variants; the Brahma repeats his request three times and the stanzas in which the request is made, as given in the Samyutta, are omitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Áyácana Vagga. The twelfth chapter of the Duka Nipáta of the Anguttara Nikáya. It contains eleven suttas on different topics. A.i.89-91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

He was very righteous and much beloved, and his chief queen, Samuddavijayá, was wise and full of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king, wishing to give alms to Pacceka Buddhas instead of to others far less holy, consulted the queen, and acting on her advice, made proclamation to his people that they should keep the precepts. He himself observed all holy days and gave great gifts in charity. One day he offered flowers to the eastern quarter, and making obeisance, wished that any Pacceka Buddha in that quarter might come to accept his alms. His wish not being fulfilled, he repeated, on the following days, the same ceremony to the other quarters till, on the fourth day, seven Pacceka Buddhas came to him from the north where they lived in Nandamúlapabbhára. The king and queen fed them for seven days and gave them robes and all the other requisites of an ascetic. The Pacceka Buddhas departed one by one, each expressing his thanks in a stanza and exhorting the king and queen to lead pure lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Pasenadi's Asadisadána, to show that wise men of old also gave gifts to holy men, with discretion (J.iii.469-74).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is evidently the story referred to as the Sucira Játaka in the introduction to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dasabraahmana_jat_495')"&gt;Dasa Bráhmana Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.360) and again as the Sovíra Játaka in the introductory story of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sivi_jat_499')"&gt;Sivi Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.401).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

When the Senapáti Mitta obtained possession of the throne, he sought to win the favour of these soldiers by giving them money. This they refused to accept and Thakuraka, going up to Mitta as he sat on the throne, cut off his head. On being questioned, he said that he had done the deed at the command of the lawful king, Bhuvanekabáhu I., who had become a refugee. The Ariya soldiers then joined forces with the Síhala army and restored Bhuvanekabáhu to the throne (Cv.xc.16-30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geiger (Cv.Tra.ii.202, n.3) thinks that these mercenaries must have come from South India. The name of their general, Thakuraka, however, seems to indicate that they were Rajputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

After death he was born in Roruva-niraya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died heirless and it took seven days and seven nights for the king's men to remove his wealth to the royal treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reply to a question of Pasenadi, the Buddha revealed why Ágantuka had been a miser: in a past birth, while going to the king's court, he had met the Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikhí begging for alms and had ordered his servant to give the food prepared for himself (Ágantuka) to the Pacceka Buddha. On his way back, seeing the Pacceka Buddha returning with the excellent food from the merchant's house in his alms-bowl, he wished he had distributed it among his own servants instead, as they would have done some work in return (J.iii.199-300).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for Ágantuka being heirless is related in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mayhaka_jat_390')"&gt;Mayhaka Játaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

That part of it which flows sixty leagues through the air is called Ákásagangá (SnA.ii.439; MA.586, etc.). The Buddha's discourse on various topics (pakinnakakathá) is like the downward flow of the Ákásagangá (AA.i.94; DhA.iii.360); so also is the eloquence of clever preachers (E.g., DhA.iv.18; J.ii.65).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fine clay to be found in the area (thirty yojanas in extent) over which the Ákásagangá falls to earth, is called, on account of its fineness, &quot;butter clay&quot; (navaníta-mattiká). This clay was brought by arahant sámaneras to be spread over the foundation of the Mahá Thúpa in Anurádhapura (Mhv.xxix.5f). The spot where it is found is called Tintasísakola.

Once when Mahá Kaccana was staying at Varaná on the banks of the Kaddamadaha, Árámadanda came to see him and asked him why nobles quarrelled with nobles, brahmins with brahmins, and householders with householders. &quot;Because of their bondage and servitude to sensual lusts,&quot; answered Mahá Kaccána; and for the same reason recluses quarrelled with recluses. &quot;Is there anybody in the world who has passed beyond this bondage?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Mahá Kaccána, &quot;in Sávatthi lives the Exalted One,&quot; and he proceeded to describe the Buddha's virtues. Áramadanda stood up with clasped hands and, turning in the direction of Sávatthi, he uttered his adoration of the Buddha. Thenceforward he became a disciple of Mahá Kaccána.

Once when Nárada was on his way to Kañcanaguhá where he dwelt and which stood at the head of Manosilátala, he carried in his hand a Páricchattaka flower, and the four daughters of Sakka - Ásá, Saddhá, Siri and Hirí - who were in Manosilátala, resting from their sports in Anotatta, on seeing him, asked him for the flower. He said he would give it to the one among them whom they chose to be their queen. He himself was asked to choose the queen, but he referred them to Sakka who, in his turn, sent them to the ascetic Macchariya-Kosiya in the Himálaya. Sakka sent in advance a cup of ambrosia to the ascetic and told his daughters that the one among them, with whom Kosiya should share his ambrosia, would be deemed the best. When they appeared before Kosiya he asked their names, and chose Hirí for the honour of sharing his meal. In rejecting Ásá, Kosiya said, &quot;They tell me that whoever pleases you, to him, by accomplishing the fruition of hope, you grant life, whosoever pleases you not, to him you grant it not. In this case success does not come to him through you, but you bring about his destruction.&quot; He spoke in like terms to the other two. The story occurs in the Sudhábhojana Játaka.

The monks had gathered together to see the Buddha and eminent disciples had been busy instructing their pupils in the various attainments. The Commentary says the Buddha had not gone on tour as usual because he wanted to give the monks opportunity of developing their attainments. (MA.ii.895-6.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing them thus assembled, the Buddha was pleased with their demeanour and described how in the confraternity of monks were to be found men of various degrees of attainment. Some of them practised the cultivation of mindfulness by breathing exercises and the Buddha proceeded to explain how it was done. Such mindfulness leads to the development of the four satipatthánas, and these, in turn, to the seven bojjhangas. Through them one attains deliverance through understanding.

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Álára Káláma&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the two teachers to whom Gotama, after his renunciation, first attached himself, the other being Uddaka Rámaputta. In the Milindapañha (p.236) Álára is mentioned as Gotama's fourth teacher. The ThigA. (p.2) says he went to Bhaggava before going to Álára. The Mtu. (ii.117f.) and the Lal. (330f), give quite different accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Ariyaparivesána Sutta (M.i.163-5; also 240ff; ii.94ff, 212ff) the Buddha describes his visit to Álára. Gotama quickly mastered his doctrine and was able to repeat it by heart; but feeling sure that Álára not only knew the doctrine but had realised it, he approached him and questioned him about it. Álára then proclaimed the Ákiñcaññáyatana, and Gotama, putting forth energy and concentration greater than Álára's, made himself master of that state. Álára recognised his pupil's eminence and treated him as an equal, but Gotama, not having succeeded in his quest, took leave of Álára to go elsewhere (VibhA.432). When, after having practised austerities for six years, the Buddha attained Enlightenment and granted Sahampati's request to preach the doctrine, it was of Álára he thought first as being the fittest to hear the teaching. But Álára had died seven days earlier (Vin.i.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books mention little else about Álára. The Mahá Parinibbána Sutta (D.ii.130; Vsm.330) mentions a Mallian, Pukkusa, who says he had been Álára’s disciple, but who, when he hears the Buddha's sermon, confesses faith in the Buddha. Pukkusa describes Álára to the Buddha as one who practised great concentration. Once Álára was sitting in the open air and neither saw nor heard five hundred passing carts though he was awake and conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As already stated above, the aim of </data>
<data>Álára’s practices is stated to have been the attainment of Akiñcaññayatana, the stage of nothingness. Whether this statement is handed down with any real knowledge of the facts of his teaching, it is not now possible to say. Asvaghosa, in his Buddhacarita (xii.17ff), puts into the mouth of Áráda or Álára, a brief account of his philosophy. It has some resemblance - though this is slight - to the Sánkhya philosophy, but in Álára’s teaching some of the salient characteristics of the Sánkhya system are absent. In reply to Gotama's questions about the religious life and the obtaining of final release, Álára describes a system of spiritual development which is identical with the methods of the Buddhist monk up to the last attainment but one. The monk reaches the four jhánas and then attains successively to the states of space, infinity and nothingness. The last three stages are described in the terms of the first three of the four Attainments. (For a discussion on this see Thomas, op. cit., p.229-30; see also MA.ii.881; VibhA.432). According to Buddhaghosa (AA.i.458), Bharandu Káláma was a disciple of Álára at the same time as Gotama and is therefore described as the Buddha's purána-sabrahmacárí (A.i.277). Buddhaghosa further tells us (DA.ii.569) that in Álára Káláma, Álára was his personal name. He was so called because he was dígha-pingala (long and tawny).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Ámagandha&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin. Before the appearance of the Buddha in the world, Ámagandha became an ascetic and lived in the region of the Himálaya with five hundred pupils. They ate neither fish nor flesh. Every year they came down from their hermitage in search of salt and vinegar, and the inhabitants of a village near by received them with great honour and showed them every hospitality for four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then one day the Buddha, with his monks, visited the same village, and the people having listened to his preaching became his followers. That year when Ámagandha and his disciples went as usual to the village, the householders did not show towards them the same enthusiasm as heretofore. The brahmin, enquiring what had happened, was full of excitement on hearing that the Buddha had been born, and wished to know if he ate &quot;ámagandha,&quot; by which he meant fish or flesh. He was greatly disappointed on learning that the Buddha did not forbid the eating of ámagandha, but, desiring to hear about it from the Buddha himself, he sought him at Jetavana. The Buddha told him that ámagandha was not really fish or flesh, but that it referred to evil actions, and that he who wished to avoid it should abstain from evil deeds of every kind. The same question had been put to the Buddha Kassapa by an ascetic named Tissa, who later became his chief disciple. In giving an account of the conversation between Kassapa Buddha and Tissa, the Buddha preached to Ámagandha the Ámagandha Sutta. The Brahmin and his followers entered the Order and in a few days became arahants.

The Álavaká-bhikkhú are mentioned several times in the Vinaya (ii.172ff.; iii.85; iv.34-5) in connection with offences relating to navakamma (repairing and reconstruction of buildings), and rules are laid down by the Buddha restricting these monks in their activities. Once when one of the monks was cutting down a tree which was the abode of a devata, the sprite was sorely tempted to kill him, but restraining her wrath she sought the Buddha and complained to him. The Buddha praised her forbearance and preached the Uraga Sutta (SnA.i.4-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the introductory story of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/manikhanta_jat_253')"&gt;Manikantha Játaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.282-3) it is stated that the importunities of these monks so annoyed the residents of Álaví that they fled at the approach of any yellow-robed monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Álaví&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town thirty yojanas from Sávatthi (SnA.i.220) and probably twelve from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; (See Watters: ii.61; Fa Hsein, 60, 62). It lay between Sávatthi and Rájagaha. (The Buddha goes from Sávatthi to Kitágiri, thence to Álaví, and finally, to Rájagaha). The Buddha, on several occasions, stayed at Álaví at the Aggálava shrine (q.v.) which was near the town. In the sixteenth year after the Enlightenment, the Buddha spent the whole of the rainy season at Álaví and preached the doctrine to 84,000 listeners (BuA.3). The King of Álaví was known as Álavaka and the inhabitants as Álavaka. The town later became famous as the residence of Álavaka Yakkha and of Hatthaka Álavaka. The Therí, Selá was born in Álaví and was therefore known as Alaviká (ThigA.62-3). There was evidently a large community of monks at Álaví, some of whom seem to have chiefly occupied themselves with building viháras for themselves (See Álavaká).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, while at Sávatthi, the Buddha saw a poor farmer of Álaví, ready for conversion and decided to go and preach in that town. The farmer's ox had strayed away, and he looked for it for quite a long while before finding it; he knew that the Buddha was in Álaví and decided that he still had time to visit the Buddha, and he set off without taking any food. Meanwhile at Álaví the Buddha and his monks had been served with a meal by the people, but the Buddha waited until the farmer came before returning thanks. On the farmer's arrival the Buddha ordered that some food should be given him, and when the man was comforted and his mind was ready the Buddha preached a sermon, at the end of which the man became a Sotápanna (DhA.iii.262-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion the Buddha came all the way from Jetavana to Álaví for the sake of a weaver's daughter. (For the </data>
<data>story see DhA.iii.170f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Álaví has been identified by Cunningham and Hoernle with Newal or Nawal in the Urao district in the United Provinces, and by Nandalal Dey, with Aviwa, twenty-seven miles north-east of Etwah (Law: Geog, of. Early Buddhism, p.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Rhys Davids states that Álaví was on the bank of the Ganges (Ps. of the Brethren, 408), probably basing her view on the declaration of Álavaka in the Sutta Nipáta (p.32) that he would throw the Buddha &quot;pára-Gangáya&quot; (over to the other side of the Ganges) unless his questions were answered. I believe that here &quot;pára-Gangáya&quot; is merely a rhetorical expression and has no geographical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

It deals with real Permanence (ánañjasappáya) and with the various ways of meditating on impassibility and the attainments and true release. True deathlessness is only the heart's deliverance (anupádá cittassa vimokkho), and there are several stages of the paths that lead to it (M.ii.261ff). Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.851) says that this sutta described the arahantship of the Sukkhavipassaká. Arahantship is mentioned in nine different connections in the sutta, which is therefore praised as being well taught (sukathitam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

In the Samyutta Nikáya (S.v.225), Ápana is spoken of as a township of the Angas (Angánam nigamo) and the Buddha is mentioned as having stayed there with Sáriputta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several suttas were preached at Ápana, among them &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/potaliya')"&gt;Potaliya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (regarding Potaliya),   (M.i.359ff) &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/latukikopama_s')"&gt;Latukikopama Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (to Udáyi)   (M.i.447ff), &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s6_siy')"&gt;Sela Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (regarding Sela)   (M.ii.146ff; Sn.pp.102ff) and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sadhaa')"&gt;Saddha or Ápana Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.225-7).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ápana was a brahmin village and was the home of the Elder Sela (ThagA.ii.47). On the occasion of the Buddha's visit to Ápana, during which he converted Sela and Keniya, he seems to have stayed at Ápana for over a week and ordained three hundred monks in the company of Sela (Sn., p.112).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.586), the village was called Ápana because it had twenty thousand bazaars (ápaná) and was therefore distinguished for its shops (ápanánam ussannattá). Near the village, on the banks of the river Mahí, was the woodland where the Buddha stayed during his visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>

<data>&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Áyácitabhatta Játaka (No. 19)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the squire of a certain village, in the Kási country, promised the deity of a banyan tree a sacrifice should his enterprise succeed. When he came back from his journey he slew a number of creatures and took them to the tree. The deity of the tree appeared and admonished the squire, saying that &lt;b&gt;no one could attain deliverance by means of slaughter&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in answer to a question by some monks, who had noticed that many people when going on a business journey would slay living creatures and offer them to various deities in order that their ventures might be successful. The monks wished to know if such sacrifices were of any good (J.i.169).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Játaka is also known as the Pánavadha Játaka (Feer: JA.1876, p.516).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</data>
